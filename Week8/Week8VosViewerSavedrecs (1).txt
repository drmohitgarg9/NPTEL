J	Clarke, RI; Amonkar, S; Rosenblad, A				Clarke, Rachel Ivy; Amonkar, Satyen; Rosenblad, Ann			Design thinking and methods in library practice and graduate library education	JOURNAL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Design thinking; graduate library education; librarianship; questionnaire surveys; United States		Despite interest in the application of design thinking and methods in librarianship, there seems to be a disconnect between application and education to support it. This study used an online questionnaire to elicit feedback from library workers in the United States about interest in and use of design thinking and methods in library practice, and the need for design skills and abilities in library education. We found that practicing librarians perceive design thinking and methods have relevance to library work, but opinions vary based on library type and nature of the work. Design thinking and methods were used mostly for space planning and program development, with applications emphasizing empathy and user/community understanding aspects-despite myriad other possibilities. Most respondents were in favor of including design thinking and methods in MLIS programs, which can support more robust applications through inclusion of the theoretical, philosophical, and epistemological underpinnings from which design thinking and methods emerge.

J	Howarth, LC; Abels, EG				Howarth, Lynne C.; Abels, Eileen G.			Linda C. Smith: Fifty Years of Library and Information Science Education by Design	LIBRARY TRENDS			English	Article								Professor emerita Linda C. Smith designed a plan of study including her bachelor's degree, various master's degrees, a PhD, and a certifi-cate along with practical experience that prepared her for her career as a library and information science (LIS) educator, researcher, and administrator. The pairing of a deep respect and admiration for con-tent and delivery is the common thread that weaves reliably across Smith's fifty years in LIS as an innovator, educator, and researcher. All that she has initiated and accomplished across that time and moving forward can also be said to be "by design"-a potent mix of experience, anticipation, an eye for identifying what is missing, and a determination to doggedly research and implement an elegant "fix" for addressing that gap. This paper explores the common thread of Smith's innovations as a LIS educator, tracing her past and continu-ing influence on the evolution of LIS curriculum content and de-livery, and where it is reflected in, even predicted for contemporary and future graduate programs in information. Suggesting a tenet of design thinking, the authors examine Smith's career path and many contributions to confirm that one can get here from there.

The benefits of utilizing the Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach in public libraries to resolve a persistent problem of practice, a lack of assessment tools to evaluate youth Computational Thinking (CT) programs, is demonstrated. Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming. Findings underscore the DBIR approach as a strategy for engaging with practitioners and helping shift their perspectives by resolving practice problems and facilitating the design of sustainable solutions.

Teaching gamification principles for library instruction to health sciences information professionals using interactive, low-tech activities and design-thinking modalities	JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION			English	Article								Background: Gamification is correlated with increased motivation and engagement of learners and is increasingly being incorporated into library instruction. Opportunities for librarians to learn and practice principles of gamification can be helpful for those desiring to incorporate gamification into instruction. This report describes the development and delivery of an interactive special content session at MLA '18, the 2018 Medical Library Association annual meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, focusing on principles of low-tech game design for health sciences library classroom instruction. Case Presentation: The special content session, titled "Design, Play, Learn: A Special Content Session to Design a Game for Database Instruction," was designed and delivered using multimodal instruction (e.g., flipped classroom, didactic component, active learning) that also incorporated principles of design thinking. A pre- and post-survey was given to all participants at the beginning and end of the session to measure confidence and desire to incorporate gamification into instruction and as a formative feedback indicator for instructors. Participants reported increased confidence and desire to use games for library instruction after participating in the session. A selection of games was uploaded to a shared content folder designed for course participants as an ongoing repository for ideas and communication. Conclusions: For librarians who are interested in incorporating principles of gamification into library instruction, attending a relatively short hands-on workshop can facilitate learning and confidence around prototyping and creating games for use in library instruction. We intend to improve upon the workshop and offer it again in additional contexts, based on direct observations of the session and participant feedback.

As semantic-spatial displays, strand maps provide a visual organization of relevant conceptual information that may promote the use of science content during digital library use. A study was conducted to compare users' cognitive processes during information seeking tasks when using a multimedia strand maps interface, versus the textual search interface currently implemented in the Digital Library for Earth System Education. Quantitative and qualitative data from think-aloud protocols revealed that students were more likely to engage with science content (e.g., analyzing the relevance of science concepts with regard to task needs) during search when using the strand maps interface compared to those using textual searching. In contrast, students using a textual search interface engaged more frequently with surface-level information (e.g., the type of a resource regardless of its science content) during search and retrieval. As a multimedia search interface for digital libraries, strand maps appear to be promising tools to promote conceptual discovery and learning through content-based processes that promote learner engagement with relevant science knowledge.

J	Han, ZB; Huang, SQ; Li, H; Ren, N				Han, Zhengbiao; Huang, Shuiqing; Li, Huan; Ren, Ni			Risk assessment of digital library information security: a case study	ELECTRONIC LIBRARY			English	Article						Digital library; Risk assessment; Vulnerability; Information security; Threats		Purpose - This paper uses the GB/T20984-2007 multiplicative method to assess the information security risk of a typical digital library in compliance with the principle and thought of ISO 27000. The purpose of this paper is to testify the feasibility of this method and provide suggestions for improving information security of the digital library. Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts convenience sampling to select respondents. The assessment of assets is through analyzing digital library-related business and function through a questionnaire which collects data to determine asset types and the importance of asset attributes. The five-point Likert scale questionnaire method is used to identify the threat possibility and its influence on the assets. The 12 respondents include directors and senior network technicians from the editorial department, comic library, children's library, counseling department and the learning promotion centre. Three different Guttman scale questionnaires, tool testing and on-site inspection are combined to identify and assess vulnerabilities. There were different Guttman scale questionnaires for management personnel, technical personnel and general librarian. In all, 15 management librarians, 7 technical librarians and 72 ordinary librarians answered the vulnerability questionnaire. On-site inspection was conducted on the basis of 11 control domains of ISO 27002. Vulnerabilities were scanned using remote security evaluation system NSFOCUS. The scanning covered ten IP sections and a total of 81 hosts. Findings - Overall, 2,792 risk scores were obtained. Among them, 282 items (accounting for 10.1 per cent of the total) reached the high risk level; 2 (0.1 per cent) reached the very high risk level. High-risk items involved 26 threat types (accounting for 44.1 per cent of all threat types) and 13 vulnerability types (accounting for 22.1 per cent of all vulnerability types). The evaluation revealed that this digital library faces seven major hidden dangers in information security. The assessment results were well accepted by staff members of this digital library, which testified to the applicability of this method to a Chinese digital library. Research limitations/implications - This paper is only a case study of a typical Chinese digital library using a digital library information security assessment method. More case-based explorations are necessary to prove the feasibility of the assessing strategy proposed in this study. Originality/value - Based on the findings of recent literature, the authors found that very few researchers have made efforts to develop methods for calculating the indicators for digital library information security risk assessment. On the basis of ISO 27000 and other related information security standards, this case study proposed an operable method of digital library information security risk assessment and used it to assess a the information security of a typical Chinese digital library. This study can offer insights for formulating a digital library information security risk assessment scale.

Design/methodology/approach This paper uses the methods of conceptual analysis and thought experiment. Findings This paper finds that current elaborations of gatekeeping theory are useful for modeling library information flows, particularly identifying and evaluating influences on those flows. It is able to reframe intransigent issues around library neutrality and open access so that more nuanced approaches can be constructed. Originality/value Gatekeeping theory as elaborated by Shoemaker and Vos for journalism and communication studies, while occasionally referenced the library and information science (LIS) literature, has not been previously evaluated as a framework for library information flows. This is the first paper to assess the potential of aspects of the theory such as levels of analysis and multiplicity of channels to reframe issues in LIS.

Design/methodology/approach - Study was conducted via online questionnaire in public libraries across country. Findings - The findings revealed that majority of respondents (83.7 percent) think it is an important task of public libraries to provide citizens with materials about the EU, and that almost all responding libraries (98 percent) have EU materials. In general, respondents think that provision of EU materials in their library does not compromise its role of politically neutral institution. The results also indicate that libraries quite rarely (10 percent) maintain links to relevant EU online sources on their websites. EU collections in responding libraries are promoted actively most frequently in the library itself and on its website, and very rarely in the local media. Practical implications - Findings are expected to be of interest to European administration in charge of the development of effective communication policies, national authorities in EU candidate and acceding countries, and information professionals in general. Originality/value - This is the first study to investigate the role of public libraries in EU information provision in an EU acceding country.

The project was intended to introduce key General Education principles such as global citizenship, scientific reasoning, communication skills, information literacy, and stewardship. Conducted in partnership with library faculty, the assignment used course-integrated workshops and one-on-one reference instruction to help students produce research papers, learn the mechanics of online library research, and practice public speaking. Assignments were designed to emphasize and refine skills such as information literacy, critical thinking, and writing, while supplementing course content with current global events. Pre- and post-surveys were conducted to analyze assimilation of skills during General Biology I and mastering of those skills the following semester.

J	Pomerantz, J; Marchionini, G				Pomerantz, Jeffrey; Marchionini, Gary			The digital library as place	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Libraries; Digital libraries; Information facilities; Information centres; Generation and dissemination of information; Organizational design		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a high-level investigation of the physical-conceptual continuum occupied by both digital and physical libraries. Design/methodology/approach - A framework is provided for thinking about the notions of place and library. The issue of materials and the ideas they represent is considered. Places for people are considered, including issues of people's sense of place in physical and digital spaces. The issue of physical and digital spaces as places for work, collaboration, and community-building is considered. Findings - As more digital libraries are built, and as more physical libraries offer electronic access to parts of their collection, two trends are likely to result: the role of the library as a storage space for materials will become decreasingly important, and the role of the library as a space for users, for individual and collaborative work, and as a space for social activity, will become increasingly important. Research limitations/implications - Digital libraries are unable to fulfill some of the functions of the physical library as physical spaces, but are able to offer functions beyond what the physical library can offer as cognitive spaces. Practical implications - Areas of likely future development for digital libraries are suggested, as vehicles for enhancing cognitive space by augmenting representations of ideas in materials. Originality/value - This paper argues that in many ways digital libraries really are places in the conceptual sense, and will continue to broaden and enrich the roles that libraries play in people's lives and in the larger social milieu.

Enhancing usability of digital libraries: Designing help features to support blind and visually impaired users	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Digital libraries; Blind users; Visually impaired users; Usability; Ease of use; Satisfaction	PERCEIVED USEFULNESS; DISABLED USERS; WEB; ACCESSIBILITY; ACCEPTANCE; INSTRUMENT; CHALLENGES; INTERNET; QUALITY; CONTEXT	Blind and visually impaired (BVI) users experience vulnerabilities in digital library (DL) environments largely due to limitations in DL design that prevent them from effectively interacting with DL content and features. Existing research has not adequately examined how BVI users interact with DLs, nor the typical problems encountered during interactions. This is the first study conducted to test whether implementing help features corresponding to BVI users' needs can reduce five critical help-seeking situations they typically encounter, with the goal to further enhance usability of DLs. Multiple data collection methods including pre-questionnaires, think-aloud protocols, transaction logs, and pre and post search interviews, were employed in an experimental design. Forty subjects were divided into two groups with similar demographic data based on data generated from pre-questionnaires. The findings of this study show that the experimental group encountered fewer number of help-seeking situations than the control group when interacting with the experimental and baseline versions of a DL. Moreover, the experimental group outperformed the control group on perceived usefulness of the DL features, ease of use of the DL, and DL satisfaction. This study provides theoretical and practical contributions to the field of library and information science. Theoretically, this study frames vulnerabilities of BVI users within the social model of disability in which improper DL design impairs their ability to effectively access and use DLs. Practically, this study takes into account BVI users' critical help-seeking situations and further translates these into the design of help features to improve the usability of DLs.

It is the most used model for information literacy instruction in schools worldwide. Since there is a lack of information literacy skills instruction in the educational system of Iran, especially in primary schools, this research evaluates an information literacy intervention in the Iranian 6th grade science classroom. The study employs a mixed-method explanatory design using a true experimental method with pre-test and post-tests. The qualitative phase investigated the experiences and perceptions of the experimental group. Results show that integrating the Big6 model into the primary science curriculum helps the students to improve their information literacy skills as well as gain a deeper understanding of the research process. Overall, the research contributes evidence to show the effectiveness of a collaborative teaching approach in information literacy instruction. This approach promotes positive attitudes among students towards the school library and the school librarian's role in the educational process.

In response, tools to oppose systemic racism and minimize harm in the classroom as well as recommendations for change and resistance are addressed. Design/methodology/approach The paper focuses on historical analysis of libraries as institutions within larger educational systems and draws heavily on critical theories as a method of critique. Findings This paper demonstrates that the 45th presidential administration is a logical progression of neoliberalism and institutionalized discrimination, which has had adverse effects on the health and safety of (primarily marginalized) students, library workers and library practice, but that critical reflection and information seeking on part of librarians may provide solutions. Originality/value Given the lack of diversity in library and information science, this paper provides critical interventions for information literacy practice. The authors' unique practical and theoretical backgrounds allow for nuanced discussion and pedagogical creation which directly impacts and addresses key issues of justice and equity in the classroom.

J	Fourie, I; Meyer, A				Fourie, Ina; Meyer, Anika			Role of libraries in developing an informed and educated nation	LIBRARY HI TECH			English	Article						Libraries; Education; Empowerment; Social responsibility; Library functions; Informed nations	CRITICAL INFORMATION LITERACY; DIGITAL INCLUSION; PUBLIC-LIBRARIES; SOCIAL-JUSTICE; SELF-EFFICACY; BEHAVIOR; PERSPECTIVE; EXPERIENCES	Purpose - Libraries of all types have often been called on to take on challenges ranging from information literacy and developing a reading culture to promoting social justice. In recent literature they have been challenged to contribute to the development of informed and educated nations - a big issue in developing countries. Sometimes even to empower people. The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness for this call as important for developing as well as developed nations and the numerous issues, role players and lenses they need to bear in mind. As an opinion piece it can merely scratch the surface of raising awareness. Design/methodology/approach - This contribution builds on the literature of library and information science, education and politics to present an exploratory viewpoint and a nascent model to support further work. It intentionally touches on a diversity of issues that may seem at odds with each other, but that in the opinion reflect the enormous scope to address and diversity of individual, institutional and global input and lenses that can make a difference. Findings - Many obvious approaches to achieve the object of an informed and educated nation with empowered individuals can be noted such as focusing on information literacy, digital literacy and information fluency. However more awareness is required of the need to take a holistic view of issues to focus on such as tolerance and ethics, and the information behaviour and information practices of people in various contexts, and how changes in the awareness of needs to address and the need to seek information and support from diverse sources, can contribute. A first step would be to note the diversity that might contribute towards a holistic view of a global problem to which libraries can contribute. Originality/value - There are limited publications on the topic in the library and information science literature although "developing an informed and educated nation" features in the mission and vision plans of some countries, and empowerment is sometimes specifically noted in publications on user education and information literacy. This paper offers an exploratory viewpoint to raise awareness to consider various approaches and threads to the topic and to not think only in terms of education and information literacy, but to recognise the full role libraries and librarians can play - also in reaching out to other role players such as users, governments and grant providers.

The first step is unveiling how young children think about the library. Thus, researchers recruited the Mosaic approach including photography, interview, and drawing to explore the features of children's libraries in children's perspectives in six libraries in China. The results indicate that first, the children's library is a "primary third place". Second, the children's library is an overlapping of home and society. Third, children can read books in the children's library, but not just read. Fourth, the children's library improves children's awareness as patrons. It is suggested that young patrons already form initial understandings of the library, begin to complain about any problems, and put forward requirements for the library. Additionally, their interpersonal needs should be paid attention to. Therefore, librarians and researchers should respect the rights of children and listen to their voice when designing and providing library services associated with children.

Although there are various schools of thought and different ways of obtaining information for measurement, one of the most favorable proposals today in the development of measuring instruments is the use of the researcher's Curriculum Vitae. The objective of this research is to design a system of indicators to measure the performance of science, technology and innovation in universities. The proposal includes specific analysis for the definition of each indicator, the mathematical procedure for its calculation, aggregation levels and time periods, as well as its meaning and usefulness. The study compiles documentary analysis of the theoretical and conceptual references that support the proposal in the Latin American context. Furthermore, an empirical survey method is proposed to assess specific contexts in the institution under study. As a result, the design of a system of indicators adjusted to the characteristics of university institutions and current trends in the Latin American region is achieved. The use and analysis of these indicators allow us to establish patterns, trends and regularities in the organization that favour institutional knowledge management on science, technology and innovation processes; and deliver adequate information management and institutional knowledge for decision-making.

J	Schroeder, HM				Schroeder, Heidi M.			Implementing accessibility initiatives at the Michigan State University Libraries	REFERENCE SERVICES REVIEW			English	Article						Academic libraries; Library services; Accessibility; Higher education; Disabilities; Library resources		Purpose - This paper aims to describe a variety of accessibility initiatives implemented at the Michigan State University (MSU) Libraries to better support persons with disabilities who want to use and access library services and resources. Design/methodology/approach - By using two campus accessibility policies to help expand and improve its accessibility efforts, the MSU Libraries implemented accessibility purchasing procedures for e-resources; drafted a five-year accessibility plan, which launched an extensive multi-year staff accessibility training plan and detailed plans for content accessibility and accessibility investment; dedicated additional library staff positions and time to accessibility; drafted an accessibility statement and website documentation; established an in-house remediation service; increased library web page and collection remediation; and began leading efforts related to vendor e-resource accessibility in the Big Ten Academic Alliance library consortium. Findings - As a result of these many accessibility initiatives, the MSU Libraries has thought strategically about and taken action on constantly improving its accessibility in a variety of areas; provided or hosted 29 staff accessibility training sessions; implemented new accessibility positions, roles and services; and helped influence and improve library e-resource accessibility, especially through its leadership in the Big Ten library consortium. Originality/value - Most libraries strive to provide welcoming access to information and library services for all users, including persons with disabilities, but resources and literature on comprehensive accessibility initiatives in academic libraries are somewhat limited. The library accessibility initiatives implemented by a large, academic research library shared in this paper will hopefully contribute to the much-needed library and information science literature on this topic.

Design/methodology/approach In this study, the ASQE-based learning approach was applied to the learning activities to cultivate students' IL, problem-solving awareness and critical thinking tendency. A total of 60 postgraduate students were invited to participate in this study. In addition, students' perceptions of library-supported learning were analysed via drawing analysis. Findings Introducing ASQE-based learning into an IL learning activity promoted reflection and thought and had positive effects on students' problem-solving awareness and on the critical thinking tendency of students with different levels of growth mindset. Additionally, the drawing analysis indicated that most of the students with low levels of growth mindset believed that learners should actively study in the library and students with higher levels of growth mindset preferred more motivating and enjoyable learning environments. Originality/value The findings of this study demonstrate that the ASQE-based learning approach can improve higher order thinking skills of students with different levels of growth mindset. In addition, this study examined the perceptions of students with different levels of growth mindset of library-supported learning via drawing analysis.

Critical thinking is a metacognitive process which an essential skill in education particularly in the 21st century. It is imperative when students need to find relevant and trustworthy information. The aims of this paper are twofold: i) to investigate the level of critical thinking among postgraduate students; ii) to investigate critical thinking practices among students when they seek for information. The study employed a quantitative research design. Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal-UK (WGCTA-UK) edition was used to examine the level of critical thinking of postgraduate students. Another survey was conducted to investigate critical thinking practices of students during their information seeking process (ISP). Questionnaires were distributed on a random basis among postgraduate students in a pilot test. A total of 45 responses were gathered. The findings from the study revealed that postgraduate students had the highest score in "recognition of assumptions" and the lowest score in "inference" in the critical thinking practices. About 71 percent of the respondents scored below average and average in several areas of CT. The findings demonstrated when students seek for information, they use several CT skills (CTS) and CT dispositions (CTD) such as inference, recognition of assumption, deduction and evaluation of arguments.

J	Repanovici, A; Rotaru, CS; Murzea, C				Repanovici, Angela; Rotaru, Cristina Salca; Murzea, Cristinel			Development of Sustainable Thinking by Information Literacy	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						information literacy; sustainability skills and abilities; higher education institutions; libraries		Developing the sustainable thinking of students is an important preoccupation of specialists, teachers, and civil society. Information literacy represents the development of students' skills to search, identify, evaluate, and ethically use scientific information. Is there a connection between sustainable thinking (ST) and information literacy (IL)? Through a scientometric study in the Web of Science (WOS) database, the authors identify clusters of keywords, analyze the articles identified in WOS, and identify the main research directions and the existing concepts. At the same time, a qualitative research study is performed regarding the opinions of students who participated in the IL class. By corroborating and interpreting the results obtained by the two previously mentioned research, the authors demonstrate a close correlation between the two, thus creating an extended map of these concepts, a limited map of the concepts used, and a theoretical map of the concepts. The connection between information literacy and the development of ST is demonstrated, thus creating the premise for a new research direction.

J	Li, GH; Wu, LL				Li, Guihua; Wu, Longlong			New service system as an information-seeking context Investigation of an unfamiliar Discovery Service	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Information retrieval; Usability; Digital library; User study; Discovery Service; Information-seeking; New information service; Social science	SEARCH PROCESS; RETRIEVAL; RESEARCHERS; PATTERNS; MODELS; USERS; ASK	Purpose - The purposes of this paper are to understand the user information seeking (IS) process under a new service system, to explore how users construct strategies and to identify the influences of the new service system on the IS process and behaviour. Design/methodology/approach - A quality research study design that included questionnaires survey, observation, thinking-aloud and interviews was employed. In all, 20 participants from 12 social science disciplines at Sichuan University, Chengdu, China were observed using the proposed Discovery Service system. The user IS process characteristics and taxonomy were analysed, and the stages matrix of IS under new system was built. Findings - Users' IS processes under the new system proved to be very complex. The features of three process stages, i.e. searching, scanning and verifying stages, and four different behaviour patterns were identified. Moreover, characteristics of IS behaviour under the new service system were described. Originality/value - User IS behaviour was addressed in a new service system context in this study, as has seldom been done in previous IS research. A comprehensive and user-centred understanding of users' exploratory practices in a new service system context was obtained, which will inform the development of information services for digital libraries. In addition, it indicated that the uncertainty of the IS process should be addressed by considering the relationships among IS, information retrieval and user-computer interaction.

J	Zerehsaz, M				Zerehsaz, Mohammad			Analysing the relationship between information-seeking and help-seeking behaviours in a digital library	ELECTRONIC LIBRARY			English	Article						User studies; Information seeking behaviours; Help seeking behaviours; Marchionini's information-seeking model	DESIGN	Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the help-seeking behaviour of users during their information-seeking in a digital library, studying the kind of help-seeking situations, help requests and using help resources with different interactive levels. For this purpose, users' help-seeking behaviour ( postgraduate students at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad) was investigated based on different stages of Marchionini's adapted model. Design/methodology/approach - This research was performed using the mixed method. In total, 38 postgraduate students at Ferdowsi University were selected by Stratified Purposive Sampling method as samples. Selecting a digital library based on considered factors, preparing help resources and designing research scenario were made as the preparation stages of performing the study. The tools used for collecting and analysing data were questionnaires, think aloud protocol and Morae software. Findings - Some of the considerable results of this research were recording the help-seeking signs in all four main stages of the adapted information-seeking model. However, in the search stage, in which a user enters the search process practically, the need for help-seeking was recorded more than it in other stages. Results also confirmed that most help requests by users were for executive help which were rooted in users' knowledge shortcomings and their passivity in help-seeking process. Because of the flexibility and speed of providing responses, participants also tended to interact with more interactive and flexible help resources and assessed this interaction more useful. Originality/value - According to the findings of this research, the adapted information-seeking model used in this study was completed, and a theoretical model for information-seeking in a digital library was suggested. In this model, help-seeking is considered as a supportive and complementary behaviour for information-seeking behaviour which begins in help-seeking situations and continues to solve problems in these situations.

J	Latham, KF; Hartel, J; Gorichanaz, T				Latham, Kiersten F.; Hartel, Jenna; Gorichanaz, Tim			Information and contemplation: a call for reflection and action	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Contemplation; Contemplative studies; Information science; Information behavior; Philosophy; Wisdom; Libraries; Museums	LIBRARY	Purpose Americans increasingly feel a sense of wonder at the universe; meditation and yoga are on the rise; and a field known as Contemplative Studies has emerged. These indicators, among others, suggest a groundswell of interest in contemplative practice and contemplative experience and raise intriguing questions for information and Information Studies. Against this backdrop, this paper asks: How might Information Studies contribute to these developments? What is the relationship between information and contemplation? What can be explored on this research frontier? Design/methodology/approach This conceptual paper is based upon a synthesis of recent writings from the field of Contemplative Studies as well as conceptual analysis of selected papers and themes in Information Studies. It draws from discussion that occurred at a Session for Interaction and Engagement at the 2018 iConference, entitled "Contemplating Information in the Pleasurable and the Profound" (Latham et al., 2018). The authors' creative thinking and personal contemplative practices also infuse and fortify the work. Findings Popular and academic contemplative movements are afoot, and Information Studies has an opportunity to participate or be left behind. The field of Contemplative Studies has established the foundational concepts that can serve as contextual material for information research into contemplation. Upon closer inspection, Information Studies has already broached the topic of contemplation at various points in its history, theory, institutional practices, and information behavior research. The conceptual points of departure for a research frontier are articulated. Originality/value Beyond data, information, and knowledge are deeper and more profound aims, such as wisdom, which is related to contemplation. This paper supplies a rationale, scholarly community, conceptual resources, historical precedents, and guiding questions for bridging information and contemplation.

J	Clarke, RI; Dobreski, B				Clarke, Rachel Ivy; Dobreski, Brian			Exploring the role of repertoire in library cataloging	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Library cataloging; Repertoire; Design; Cataloger's judgement; Think-aloud; Observation	DESIGN; ORGANIZATION; EDUCATION; QUALITY; TIME; RDA	Purpose Library work is increasingly being explored from the perspective of design. Still, little work has actively explored specific aspects of design as they relate to library cataloging. The purpose of this paper is to dive deeper into the relationship between library cataloging and design by exploring a specific aspect of design - the concept of repertoire, or the use of previous experiences and bodies of knowledge during current work. Design/methodology/approach To examine catalogers' use of repertoire, this paper employed a juxtaposition of field observations of professional library catalogers' work processes with elements of "think-aloud" protocols. Findings The researchers identified three major types of repertory knowledge that were demonstrated by catalogers: internally embedded repertory knowledge; externally embedded repertory knowledge; and seeking out new knowledge using other sources. Additionally, certain trends were noted concerning which repertory knowledge was utilized for which particular task. Determining subject and genre headings were noted for relying quite extensively on internal repertoire such as personal knowledge and institutional knowledge, along with external sources, such as personal notes and local examples. Originality/value This paper adds to a growing body of work calling for design approaches in libraries and related information settings, and breaks ground by applying the previously unexplored concept of repertoire to librarianship, specifically library cataloging, which offers a new perspective on cataloger's judgement.

The design of combinatorial chemical libraries can be complex and there has been much information recently published offering suggestions on how the design process can be carried out. This review focuses on literature with the goal of organizing current thinking. At this point in time, it is clear that benchmarking of current suggested methods is required as opposed to further new methods.

J	Dalmer, NK				Dalmer, Nicole K.			Considering the local and the translocal Reframing health information practice research using institutional ethnography	ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Health information; Work; Information practices; Institutional ethnography; Family caregiving; Ruling relations	BEHAVIOR; WORK; COLLECTIVIST; LIBRARY	Purpose Institutional ethnography is a method of inquiry that brings attention to people's everyday work while simultaneously highlighting broader sites of administration and governance that may be organising that work. The purpose of this paper is to argue that the integration of institutional ethnography in health information practice research represents an important shift in the way that Library and Information Science professionals and researchers study and understand these practices. Design/methodology/approach This paper first explores the key tenets and conceptual underpinnings of Dorothy Smith's institutional ethnography, illuminating the importance of moving between translocal and the local contexts and identifying ruling relations. Drawing from a library and information science study that combined interviews and textual analyses to examine the social organisation of family caregivers' health-related information work, the paper then explores the affordances of starting in the local particularities and then moving outwards to the translocal. Findings The paper concludes with an overall assessment of what institutional ethnography can contribute to investigations of health information practices. By pushing from the local to the translocal, institutional ethnography enables a questioning of existing library and information science conceptualisations of context and of reappraising the everyday-life information seeking work/non-work dichotomy. Ultimately, in considering both the local and the translocal, institutional ethnography casts a wider net on understanding individuals' health information practices. Originality/value With only two retrieved studies that combine institutional ethnography with the study of health information practices, this paper offers health information practice researchers a new method of inquiry in which to reframe the application of methods used.

J	Nicholson, KP				Nicholson, Karen P.			Spatial thinking, gender and immaterial affective labour in the post-Fordist academic library	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Spatial thinking; Space-time; Gender; Academic librarians; Immaterial labour; Affective labour; Public service; Post-Fordism; Globalization; Knowledge economy	PUBLIC MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION LITERACY; EMOTIONAL LABOR; TIME; POLITICS; SPACE; GLOBALIZATION; UNIVERSITIES; IMAGINARIES; EXPERIENCE	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to use spatial thinking (space-time) as a lens through which to examine the ways in which the socio-economic conditions and values of the post-Fordist academy work to diminish and even subsume the immaterial affective labour of librarians even as it serves to reproduce the academy. Design/methodology/approach The research question informing this paper asks, In what ways does spatial thinking help us to better understand the immaterial, invisible and gendered labour of academic librarians' public service work in the context of the post-Fordist university? This question is explored using a conceptual approach and a review of recent library information science (LIS) literature that situates the academic library in the post-Fordist knowledge economy. Findings The findings suggest that the feminized and gendered immaterial labour of public service work in academic libraries - a form of reproductive labour - remains invisible and undervalued in the post-Fordist university, and that academic libraries function as a procreative, feminized spaces. Originality/value Spatial thinking offers a corrective to the tendency in LIS to foreground time over space. It affords new insights into the spatial and temporal aspects of information work in the global neoliberal knowledge economy and suggests a new spatio-temporal imaginary of the post-Fordist academic library as a site of waged work.

J	Si, L; Pan, QY; Zhuang, XZ				Si, Li; Pan, Qiuyu; Zhuang, Xiaozhe			An empirical analysis of user behaviour on multilingual information retrieval	ELECTRONIC LIBRARY			English	Article						Information retrieval; User studies; Information seeking behaviours; Multilingual information access; Think-aloud protocols	IMAGE RETRIEVAL; ACADEMIC USERS; LANGUAGES	Purpose - This paper aims to understand user information behaviours when they perform multilingual information retrieval. It also offers reference for the development of multilingual information retrieval systems and relevant service platforms. Design/methodology/approach - The authors designed an experiment on multilingual information retrieval with WorldWideScience, utilized Camtasia studio7 (a screen capturing and recording tool) to record overall operational processes of subjects and collected participants' thought processes with think-aloud protocols. Meanwhile, a questionnaire survey and interviews were used to examine the subjects' background information, their feelings for the experiment and their ideas about the experimental platform, respectively. Thirty-two valid data points were obtained by 41 subjects. Findings - The users preferred their own language for retrieval. Most users from social science chose general search or advanced search freely according to the tasks. The majority of the participants selected key words directly from the tasks as search terms. Doctoral candidates were more likely to construct a search query with logic symbols. Translation tools were utilized for assisting retrieval and solving doubts of translation. When facing obstacles, users stayed on the original web page to explore continually, followed by back to homepage. Originality/value - This paper provides a study of user behaviour through investigating how users behave on the whole process of retrieving multilingual information. The findings offer advice for optimizing the function of multilingual information retrieval systems and service platforms.

A Nationwide Library System and Its Place in Knowledge Society and Smart Nation: The Case of Singapore	LIBRI-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION STUDIES			English	Article						library system; Singapore; NLB; smart nation; knowledge society	PUBLIC-LIBRARIES	What role can a library system play in the development of a knowledge society and a smart city or a smart nation? In Singapore, we are able to identify governmental master plans to develop and to consolidate a knowledge society and a knowledge-based economy since around 1980. The current Smart Nation plan aims for comprehensive digital innovations in the country. Singapore's National Library Board (NLB) is an agency of the Ministry of Communication and Information; it is responsible for the Public Libraries, the National Library, and the National Archives. Its duties are regulated by law. This article describes the tasks of NLB and its institutions, the physical as well as digital resources, NLB's services (for instance, OneSearch and the Singapore Memory Project), important programs (e.g. activities to foster digital literacy and information literacy), NLB's social media activities, and, finally, user participation (following design thinking) in the development of NLB's services. In contrast to many other countries in the world, the nationwide library system in Singapore plays an important role on the way towards a knowledge society and Smart Nation as it fosters ubiquitous access to knowledge (content), provides spaces for the community, and attempts to deepen digital literacy skills of all Singaporeans.

J	Richardson, A				Richardson, Amanda			Practitioner involvement in teaching LIS at UWE	ASLIB PROCEEDINGS			English	Article						Information science; Library management; Education; United Kingdom		Purpose - This paper aims to review the practitioner-based teaching model for the MSc in Information and Library Management (ILM) at the University of the West of England (UWE). With input from students, practitioners and academics it considers the advantages and disadvantages of this approach and questions whether this is indeed the way forward for US education. Design/methodology/approach - A case study approach is used with views gained from students, practitioners and academic staff involved in the course. These views were gained from a combination of informal focus groups, informal interviews and a short e-mail questionnaire asking current students their views on practitioner involvement in the course. Findings - Findings reveal a model of practitioner-based learning on the MSc HA at UWE, which is meeting student and employer needs in terms of the skills they require in their future roles. Findings also raise questions as to how one can best ensure the involvement of practitioners in the future of the course; whether practitioner input is needed from a broader range of roles outside the library and information service; and how one can best maintain a balance of academic and practical skills. Practical implications - The study suggests that more thought may be needed on securing practitioner involvement in the development and delivery of US education and further consideration on whether some of that involvement should be from a wider range of roles. Originality/value - The paper identifies the need to consider how to best ensure the ongoing involvement of practitioners in US education, particularly those outside academic libraries, whilst maintaining the balance of academic rigour.

J	Jamali, HR; Shahbaztabar, P				Jamali, Hamid R.; Shahbaztabar, Pria			The effects of internet filtering on users' information-seeking behaviour and emotions	ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Iran; Emotions; Information behaviour; Internet filtering; Internet censorship; Website blocking	PUBLIC-LIBRARIES; STUDENTS PERCEPTIONS; RESEARCH ANXIETY; ACCESS; IDENTIFICATION; EXPERIENCE; RETRIEVAL; SCIENCE; MODEL	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between internet filtering, emotions and information-seeking behaviour. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 15 postgraduate students at an Iranian university participated in the study which involved a questionnaire, search tasks with think aloud narratives, and interviews. Findings - Internet content filtering results in some changes in the information-seeking behaviour of users. Users who face website blocking use a variety of methods to bypass filtering, mostly by using anti-filter software. Filtering encourages users to use channels such as social networking services to share resources and it increases the use of library material by some of the users. Users who face filtering during their search are more likely to visit more pages of results and click on more hits in the results, unlike users who do not experience filtering who rarely go past the first page. Blocking users' access to content stimulates their curiosity and they become more determined to access the content. In terms of the affective aspect, filtering causes several negative emotions (e.g. anger, disgust, sadness and anxiety) and the main reason for these emotions is not the inability to access information but the feeling of being controlled and not having freedom. Research limitations/implications - The study was limited to a small number of postgraduate students in social sciences and not generalisable to all user groups. The implication is that in countries where filtering is used, libraries can play an important role in serving users and reducing users negative emotions, especially if libraries can take advantage of technologies such as social media for their services. Originality/value - This is first study to address the effects of internet filtering on information-seeking behaviour and emotions. The study shows that internet filtering causes negative emotions and results in some changes in information-seeking behaviour.

The population for the study consisted of 85 academic teaching staff employed by LIS schools in South African universities. A survey design was used to obtain data for the study, through a questionnaire containing open- and close-ended questions. A total of 85 teaching staff in 10 LIS schools in South Africa were alerted, through email, to the location of the Web-based questionnaires, developed using the Stellarsurvey software. A total of 51 questionnaires were completed and returned for analysis. The findings suggest that factors such as networking, sharing of resources, enhancing productivity, educating students, overcoming intellectual isolation, and accomplishments of projects in a short time as well as learning from peers influenced research collaboration in LIS in South Africa. Factors that are likely to hinder effective collaboration in LIS research include bureaucracy, lack of funding, lack of time, as well as physical distance between researchers. The findings further suggest that even though there are drawbacks to collaboration, majority of LIS researchers thought that collaboration is beneficial and should be encouraged.

In-person and online escape rooms for individual and team-based learning in health professions library instruction	JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Escape room; game-based learning; gamification; optometry; pharmacy; medicine; health professions students; teaching; instruction; active learning; team-based learning	INFORMATION LITERACY	Background: A growing body of research demonstrates that adapting the popular entertainment activity "escape rooms" for educational purposes as an innovative teaching method can improve the learning experience. Escape rooms promote teamwork, encourage analytical thinking, and improve problem solving. Despite the increasing development and use of escape rooms in health sciences programs and academic libraries, there is little literature on the use of this method in health sciences libraries with health professions students.Case Presentation: Staff at a health sciences library collaborated with faculty to incorporate escape rooms into library instruction in a variety of settings (in-person, hybrid, online) and formats (team, individual) with health professions students from various disciplines (optometry, pharmacy, medicine). The escape rooms described in this paper offered unique experiences for students through active learning.Discussion: Important considerations when planning escape rooms for health sciences library instruction include deciding on team-based or individual design, calculating potential costs in time and money, deciding on an in-person, hybrid, or online format, and determining whether grades should be assigned. Escape rooms can be an effective strategy for library instruction in the health sciences, working in multiple formats to bring game-based learning to a variety of health professions students.

An evaluation of copyright communication infrastructure: Fostering stakeholder harmony in academic libraries in Ghana	JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP			English	Article						Academic libraries; Copyright communication; Copyright infrastructure; Faculty liaison; outreach; Online tutorials; Stakeholder harmony		Academic librarians find themselves in a lacuna whilst offering support to their users in accessing copyrighted works. This study evaluated the infrastructure for communicating copyright information in a way that would foster stakeholder harmony in academic libraries in Ghana. The study used data from 530 postgraduate students, 38 library staff and 4 head librarians by employing the sequential explanatory mixed methods design. The results show poor knowledge of copyright infrastructure for communicating copyright information. Both students and library staff were either not sure if the library had a designated copyright centre or expert, if the designated centre or expert was located in the library or aware of any department dedicated to educating the university community on the use of copyrighted materials. Also the students did not find information or documentation on copyright policies on their university campuses adequate (1:1) = 0.620, n = 530, P = 0.000). The professional librarians either said "yes" or were "not sure" compared to the paraprofessional staff who thought that there was not enough information/documentation on copyright laws/policies (1:1) = 1.208, n = 38, P < 0.001). Faculty liaison/outreach was the most often used medium to communicate copyright information. However students' preference was for "Online tutorials" for raising awareness of copyrighted materials usage. This study underpins the poor understanding of copyright, and raises potential challenges in stakeholder harmony in academic libraries in Ghana.

J	Freeburg, D; Klein, K				Freeburg, Darin; Klein, Katie			Are library staff autonomous? The influence of routines and the development of workarounds	JOURNAL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						Autonomy paradox; knowledge work; library staff; public libraries	ORGANIZATIONAL ROUTINES; KNOWLEDGE WORK; EXPECTATIONS; COMMUNITIES; WORKAHOLISM; ENVIRONMENT; FRAMEWORK; IMPACTS; CONTEXT; DESIGN	As knowledge workers, library staff are assumed to be highly autonomous, meaning that they are in control of how work is done. Yet, this work is heavily influenced by the expectations of others, and the expectation to take control can pressure staff to overwork. In this qualitative study, 13 public library staff members engaged in think-alouds (TAs) and semi-structured interviews (SSIs) aimed at uncovering potential misalignments between a staff member's own prescriptive expectations for library work and the expectations of management, customers, colleagues, and technological and material artifacts. Findings suggest that public library staff have several expectations for how work will be done and, at times, want the freedom to control work in ways that match these expectations. They devise and implement defiance workarounds aimed at reinforcing their own expectations in the face of conflicting expectations from other system actors. Yet, autonomy is a multifaceted concept that goes beyond the mere need for control and, sometimes, giving up control meant that other needs were fulfilled. This study advances research on the nature of workplace autonomy and the active role of workers in its expression. This study also has implications for library management, as it suggests important considerations for shared autonomy and workplace relationships, as well as the need to engage in efforts aimed at shifting problematic expectations in the library work system.

J	Zhang, PY; Soergel, D				Zhang, Pengyi; Soergel, Dagobert			Towards a comprehensive model of the cognitive process and mechanisms of individual sensemaking	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Review						information use; information seeking; cognition	INFORMATION-SEEKING; EXTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS; TASK COMPLEXITY; SENSE-MAKING; KNOWLEDGE; SEARCH	This review introduces a comprehensive model of the cognitive process and mechanisms of individual sensemaking to provide a theoretical basis for: empirical studies that improve our understanding of the cognitive process and mechanisms of sensemaking and integration of results of such studies; education in critical thinking and sensemaking skills; the design of sensemaking assistant tools that support and guide users. The paper reviews and extends existing sensemaking models with ideas from learning and cognition. It reviews literature on sensemaking models in human-computer interaction (HCI), cognitive system engineering, organizational communication, and library and information sciences (LIS), learning theories, cognitive psychology, and task-based information seeking. The model resulting from this synthesis moves to a stronger basis for explaining sensemaking behaviors and conceptual changes. The model illustrates the iterative processes of sensemaking, extends existing models that focus on activities by integrating cognitive mechanisms and the creation of instantiated structure elements of knowledge, and different types of conceptual change to show a complete picture of the cognitive processes of sensemaking. The processes and cognitive mechanisms identified provide better foundations for knowledge creation, organization, and sharing practices and a stronger basis for design of sensemaking assistant systems and tools.

J	Curry, R				Curry, Robert			Insights from a cultural-historical HE library makerspace case study on the potential for academic libraries to lead on supporting ethical-making underpinned by 'Critical Material Literacy'	JOURNAL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Academic libraries; Activity Theory; Critical Information Literacy; Critical Making; Critical Material Literacy; Embodied Learning; Relational Agency; Makerspaces; Systems Thinking	SERVICE	This article explores the tensions and contradictions in the potential success of maker-learning in Higher Education (HE) as supported in academic library makerspaces. Insights are formed from an in-depth, Cultural-Historical Activity Theory framed case study on a well-established North American HE academic library-based makerspace service. Lessons are drawn from the organisational tensions that emerged as challenges in its development. Participants were from the library service, students and academics from different disciplines that make significant use of the library makerspace. The 'relational agency' and 'common knowledge' of academic librarians in bringing together academic and student perspectives on the utility of maker-learning is found to be key. Maker-learning is observed to be an intertwined embodied/haptic, social/dialogic and rational/critical expansive cross-disciplinary system in a Zone of Proximal Development. Evidence of attempts to address the themes of inclusivity, diversity and sustainability to achieve ethical-maker-learning outcomes are discussed and developed. The article then expands on Ratto's Critical Maker pedagogy utilised by the case study library service. I conclude with the proposal of a potentially transformative new concept for supporting cross-disciplinary maker-learning systems, 'Critical Material Literacy' (CML), whereby technical and material awareness connects with progressive concerns for people and the planet. This new theoretical concept is designed to start proactively addressing the key case study themes, with academic librarians becoming critical agents in creating ethical-maker knowledge hubs.

J	Bird-Meyer, M; Erdelez, S; Bossaller, J				Bird-Meyer, Matthew; Erdelez, Sanda; Bossaller, Jenny			The role of serendipity in the story ideation process of print media journalists	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Newspapers; Written communications; Information Science; Generation and dissemination of information; Research; Social sciences	CONSTANT COMPARATIVE METHOD; INFORMATION-SEEKING	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to build upon the studies of journalism from an LIS perspective by exploring and differentiating the purposive behavior of newspaper reporters from their serendipitous encounters with information that lead to new story ideas. This paper also provides a path toward pedagogical improvements in training the modern journalism workforce in being more open to creative story ideas. Design/methodology/approach This study utilized semi-structured telephone interviews. Participants were recruited via e-mail after collecting contact information through the Cision database. The study sample was drawn from newspaper reporters who work at or freelance for the top 25 metropolitan newspapers in the USA, in terms of circulation size, based on data from the Alliance for Audited Media. A total of 15 participants were interviewed. Findings This paper provides insight into the story ideation process of journalists in that the study participants generally do not think about how they are coming up with story ideas as much as they are striving to place themselves in situations where, based on their experience and interests, they know they are more likely to encounter a good idea. Each encounter proved meaningful in some powerful fashion, which speaks to the historical importance of serendipity in achieving breakthroughs and discoveries in a wide variety of fields. Research limitations/implications - The sampling frame for this study was relatively small, representing 8 percent of the total number of working newspaper journalists from the top 25 newspapers in the USA, in terms of circulation size. Therefore, the findings are not generalizable to the entire population of journalists in this country. Practical implications - The findings point to the importance of a prepared mind in facilitating serendipitous episodes. In the case of journalism, that means developing a heightened news sense and cultivating routines where they place themselves in trigger-rich environments. Pedagogically, journalism education must include courses in creative storytelling to help train the modern newspaper workforce in an ever-expanding and competitive media landscape. These courses, ideally paired with techniques and models from the field of information science and learning technologies, could help train young journalists in methods that enhance their ability to identify, seek and pursue serendipitous stories. Originality/value This paper fulfills a need in journalism studies in finding variability in news routines by utilizing an interdisciplinary approach that combines journalism studies and library and information science models to probe how journalists encounter ideas incidentally. Previous research in this area has focused on how news consumers serendipitously encounter information. This paper takes a fresh approach to explore how creative ideas are encountered serendipitously in the construction of news.

J	Shen, Y				Shen, Yi			Emerging scenarios of data infrastructure and novel concepts of digital libraries in intelligent infrastructure for human-centred communities: A qualitative research	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Complex adaptive systems; data infrastructure; digital library systems; future library vision and scenarios; intelligent infrastructure for human-centred communities; smart library concepts		This research investigated the strategic development of a large-scale transdisciplinary area, named intelligent infrastructure for human-centred communities, at Virginia Tech. Within such development, this study explored the future vision and anticipated scenarios of data infrastructure and digital libraries for smart community development. It draws upon the mixed-methods approach combining ethnographic participant observation, document analysis and semi-structured interviews. Grounded in socio-technical framework and rooted in empirical methods, this research produces results that augment design thinking and visioning practice for digital data libraries beyond traditional boundaries. The findings reveal the emerging scenarios around complex adaptive systems, intelligent data infrastructure and future digital libraries all in the context of building infrastructure for human-centred communities. Situated in this advancing reality, the results further discuss the next-generation data and information user experience, smart infrastructure data environment and future library capabilities. The article concludes that a smart library system, whether in its conceptual form of a 'digital octopus' or a 'smart village data hub' or an 'intelligent virtual assistant', will provide intelligence in data gathering, processing, summarising, communication and recommendations. By delivering unified and personalised data solutions, it will offer an end-to-end seamless experience for users throughout their journey of knowledge pursuit.

J	Durak, HY; Uslu, NA; Bilici, SC; Güler, B				Durak, Hatice Yildiz; Uslu, Nilufer Atman; Bilici, Sedef Canbazoglu; Guler, Bekir			Examining the predictors of TPACK for integrated STEM: Science teaching self-efficacy, computational thinking, and design thinking	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Science teacher; TPACK; STEM; Integrated STEM; Computational thinking; Design thinking; Self-efficacy	PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE; PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; TEACHERS PERCEPTIONS; MATHEMATICS; TECHNOLOGY; EDUCATION; GENERATION; BELIEFS	In this study, the role of science and computational thinking (CT) in teaching self-efficacy and design thinking variables were examined to explain the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) knowledge forms needed by science teachers for integrated Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) within the framework of the TPACK framework. 216 teachers working as science teachers in Turkey participated in the research. In the study, data were collected in an electronic form consisting of five parts. The model proposed in the research was tested with the partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method. The research showed that the self-efficacy of science teachers was related to technological pedagogical engineering knowledge (TPEK), T- integrated (I) STEM, and technological pedagogical science knowledge (TPSK). In addition, the self-efficacy of science teachers is also effective in design thinking. CT teaching self-efficacy has a positive effect on design thinking and the development of technological pedagogical mathematics knowledge (TPMK), TPEK, and TPSK structures. Design thinking skill is also related to TPMK, TPEK, and TPSK structures. These results can be a guide to ensure the effectiveness of professional development programs that will be prepared to improve science teachers' integrated STEM competencies.

Caring for the community: An academically based community service course in LIS	JOURNAL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Design thinking; digital youth; librarianship; participatory design; service learning; co-design	LIBRARY; DESIGN	The field of Library and Information Science (LIS) has historically struggled to connect theory and practice in its graduate education, specifically when it comes to building partnerships with diverse stakeholders in public library communities. One possible technique for bridging the gap of stakeholder experiences is academically based community service (ABCS) courses. ABCS courses attempt to directly focus on research-practitioner partnerships to solve real-world problems by involving the community to democratically co-design the curriculum. In this paper, we present a reflective case study of an ABCS course on integrating participatory design methods to co-design new digital learning activities for youth in an urban public library. By conducting 10 co-design sessions and 26 semi-structured interviews, we examined a partnership between a university and a library, and how this ABCS course impacted different stakeholder participation. Our findings highlight how ABCS courses require systematic structural endeavors from higher education and care between all stakeholders within a library setting. This work contributes to a growing body of work that calls for more courses in LIS education with greater civic and democratic engagement between graduate students, university partners, and library stakeholders.

Using a longitudinal design involving an experimental and a control school, the present study examined whether an integrated library facility in a Dutch primary school has an effect on the reading attitude and reading behaviour of non-western migrant students (n = 140). The results showed no statistically significant effect on the degree in which students think reading is fun. On the other hand, over time, students attending the experimental school considered reading more useful than students visiting the control school. With regard to reading behaviour, no statistically significant effect of the school library was found. However, the school library programme was not implemented in the most optimal form, which may have affected the findings. Reading climate at home was found to be an important predictor of both reading attitude and reading behaviour, stressing the importance of parents as partners for school libraries when it comes to reading promotion.

This conceptual paper discusses the ways in which service design and design thinking can be applied to improve information search processes. Method. The paper shows possibilities for combining searches with service design and presents a persona-based, fictional case example of how a search might be improved. Analysis. By using the case example, the paper shows that this approach can be used to improve searches and to develop search engine selection and search engines further. Results. As the paper is focused on theory development through extrapolation, the key result is a recommendation for further research and experimentation on how to use service design to improve information searches. Conclusions. The paper concludes with several directions for further research, including search engine marketing and design, task stage optimization, and the crowdsourcing of searches.

Relevant existing studies have indicated significant limitations of implementing context-sensitive information retrieval services in healthcare organizations, but attempts are yet at their emergent stage for designing research-based solutions. In this paper, we design a new information retrieval architecture as a solution artifact useful in healthcare organizations for improving their information retrieval practices. Under the design science research paradigm, we outline a combined methodology that comprises design science research, design thinking and systems thinking for operating an iterative guiding process for developing and evaluating the new information retrieval approach. A total of 13 requirements that are linked to user-oriented theory of information need and fitness-utility model are captured. The new architecture is evaluated for its usefulness and fitness-utility using multi-case in-depth interviews that satisfy formalizing prescriptive knowledge on information retrieval.

J	Hirsh, SG				Hirsh, SG			Children's relevance criteria and information seeking on electronic resources	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article							SCIENCE-LIBRARY-CATALOG; SEARCH PROCESS; BEHAVIOR; FIND	This study explores the relevance criteria and search strategies elementary school children applied when searching for information related to a class assignment in a school library setting. Students were interviewed on two occasions at different stages of the research process; field observations involved students thinking aloud to explain their search processes and shadowing as students moved around the school library. Students performed searches on an on-line catalog, an electronic encyclopedia, an electronic magazine index, and the World Wide Web. Results are presented for children selecting the topic, conducting the search, examining the results, and extracting relevant results. A total of 254 mentions of relevance criteria were identified, including 197 references to textual relevance criteria that were coded into nine categories and 57 references to graphical relevance criteria that were coded into five categories. Students exhibited little concern for the authority of the textual and graphical information they found, based the majority of their relevance decisions for textual material on topicality, and identified information they found interesting. Students devoted a large portion of their research time to finding pictures. Understanding the ways that children use electronic resources and the relevance criteria they apply has implications for information literacy training and for systems design.

In K-12 education, much is left to be known about how to develop curricula to more effectively foster students' design and creative thinking. This study introduced maker education to the information technology course to investigate the effects of design-oriented making on students' learning of programming, creativity, and design thinking. Seventy-two fifth-grade students from two classes at a rural primary school in China participated in this eight-week study. Both classes learned about programming a digital greeting card with Mind+, when the experimental group was taught with a design-oriented making pedagogy, whereas the control group learned through a conventional teaching approach. Questionnaires were used to assess students' knowledge learning, creativity and design thinking competence. Findings showed that when embedded in an open-ended problem-solving context, integrating design thinking into making as a pedagogy can be conducive to the development of design thinking and creativity. Important implications are made to inform future endeavors in fostering student thinking in maker education.

J	Adriaenssen, DJ; Johannessen, JA				Adriaenssen, Daniel J.; Johannessen, Jon-Arild			Paradigms in information science Steps towards a systemic paradigm for information science	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Information theory; Philosophy; Knowledge management; Systemic thinking; Philosophy of science	SOCIAL-SCIENCE; PHILOSOPHY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is the conceptual expansion of the science-theoretical foundations of information science, i.e. to develop new thought schemes for information science. Design/methodology/approach - The design of the paper is as follows: first, the paper will discuss the foundation of the systemic paradigm (SP). Then the authors will consider the history of information science related to the philosophy of science. In the remaining part of the paper, the authors will investigate information science and its relation to the philosophy of science, focusing on SP. Findings - In conclusion, the authors will summarise the seven criteria for the application of SP in information science. Research limitations/implications - Paradigms in information science have rarely reflected upon the use of a SP in information science. Practical implications - The practical use of the seven criteria in information science Criterion 1: make your premises, suppositions, prerequisites and motives explicit. Criterion 2: make your moral/ethical results and consequences explicit. Criterion 3: research should be evaluated in relation to the transcendence of knowledge. Criterion 4: emphasise methodical pluralism, i.e. empirical generalisations and conceptual generalisations. Criterion 5: emphasise proximity and in-depth studies. Criterion 6: look for patterns and patterns which combine. Criterion 7: look for the power behind the patterns. Social implications - The opinion is that scientists to a great extent should seek knowledge on the basis of a belief, a specific way of thinking, and by means of specific methods. To make the authors belief explicit makes the way of thinking visible. What the authors achieve, and possibly the only thing the authors can achieve, is to reaffirm the conscious belief. This does not make reality more real, but it could put the authors in a better position to see through the authors way of thinking when faced with scientific problems. This indicates that a scientific study should emphasise all three entities: "The Context of Discovery", "The Context of Justification" and "The Context of Solution". These three entities, according to SP, make up the unity of the scientific process. Originality/value - The seven criteria entail that Kuhn's argumentative chain (where he tries to find out why theory A is preferred to theory B on a rational pretext) does not concur with SP. This indicates that a scientific study should emphasise all three entities: "The Context of Discovery", "The Context of Justification" and " The Context of Solution". These three entities, according to SP, make up the unity of the scientific process.

However, the lack of validated information literacy assessments relevant for engineering students makes it difficult to determine how well those students are acquiring needed information literacy skills. We describe validity evidence for the Critical-Thinking Engineering Information Literacy Test (CELT), an instrument designed to assess students' information literacy associated with critical thinking in an engineering context. By examining psychometric properties of CELT through Rasch modeling applications, we present evidence of appropriate and fair use of CELT among first-year engineering student populations. From our analysis, we find that CELT is appropriate for use in the classroom to assess information skills associated with critical thinking among first-year engineering students, when students' experience with English language is part of their score interpretation. We discuss specific recommendations for use with students who have little experience learning in an English language environment.

The profit-seeking behavior of agents, however, risks inefficient allocation of goods and services, as agents take strategic stances that might backfire. While it would be good if we could impose mechanisms to remove incentives for strategic reasoning, this is not possible in the UMDL. Therefore, our approach has instead been to study whether encouraging the other extreme -making strategic reasoning ubiquitous-provides an answer. Toward this end, we have designed a strategy (called the p-strategy) that uses a stochastic model of the market to find the best offer price. We have then examined the collective behavior of p-strategy agents in the UMDL auction. Our experiments show that strategic thinking is not always beneficial and that the advantage of being strategic decreases with the arrival of equally strategic agents. Furthermore, a simpler strategy can be as effective when enough other agents use the p-strategy. Consequently, we expect the UMDL is likely to evolve to a point where some agents use simpler strategies and some use the p-strategy.

Librarians have also shown increased interest in learning theories and instructional design (ID). However, there has not yet been a systematic survey of the literature on how librarians are using ID models and systematic ID in professional practice. Methods: The researchers conducted this scoping review of journal articles published since 1990 to look at what ID models or systematic ID are used in academic library instruction and what is role and influence of ID. Nine databases were searched to identify articles. Results: Of the 11,221 abstracts, 58 articles described use of a systematic ID or an ID model to create an instructional product. The review found that ID models were sparsely represented in the literature and that it often appeared in a simplified or adapted form. However, it held particular promise as a tool for collaboration and reflective teaching practices. Conclusions: While instruction represents a major skillset in academic librarianship, the application of ID needs further representation in the scholarly literature. Further reflection on librarian use of ID can inform teaching practices committed to accountability in higher education and learner centeredness for their populations.

Documenting the fun: Studying artistic information-creating behavior using research diaries	LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						Research diaries; Documentation; Information activity; Making; Leisure	PHOTOGRAPHY; PHOTOVOICE; SEEKING; LIFE	Research diaries as a qualitative method are found practical in information science. In information behavior literature, they are effective for capturing human experience and thought in situ in emic view. Although previous scholars undertook research diaries to explore information needs, seeking, use, and more, what is left relatively unknown is how this method may garner diverse forms of data beyond text when studying inherently dynamic information creation. To address this gap, this study applied research diaries inspired by cultural probes and maker documentation to investigate the making process of 25 arts and crafts hobbyists. Findings present a wide variety of entries generated from participants, illuminating the benefits of using research diaries to facilitate making and encourage reflection. Design implications are shared to unlock the potential of research diaries for examining information behavior, demonstrating their value in gathering rich empirical data and bringing participants engaging research experiences.

J	Agarwal, NK; Alsaeedi, F				Agarwal, Naresh Kumar; Alsaeedi, Farraj			Creation, dissemination and mitigation: toward a disinformation behavior framework and model	ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Misinformation; Disinformation; Fake news; Information behavior; Disinformation behavior; Confirmation bias	FAKE NEWS; INFORMATION BEHAVIOR; QUALITY; SEEKING	Purpose This paper seeks to disambiguate the phenomenon by clarifying terms, highlighting current efforts, including the importance of critical thought and awareness, and a test for genuine serendipity. Design/methodology/approach The authors review the literature, primarily from a library and information science perspective, and arrive at a theoretical framework and model. Findings The authors find various initiatives to fight fake news. Building upon Karlova and Fisher's (2013) model as well as research on critical thinking and serendipity, the primary contribution of the paper is a disinformation behavior framework and model. The model includes both the problem of disinformation from a creator and user perspective, as well as the solutions to fight it. Research limitations/implications The framework will guide practitioners and researchers in library and information science and beyond, as well as other stakeholders in both understanding the phenomenon, and leading the fight against it. Originality/value The spreading of false information has become an alarming phenomenon in the last few years, leading to the popularity of terms such as misinformation, disinformation, infodemic and fake news. While information professionals have been called upon to lead the fight against fake news, in the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon, current efforts have been isolated and inadequate. Most models of information behavior deal with information, and not misinformation or disinformation per se.

J	Miao, ZY				Miao, Zeyi			Investigation on human rights ethics in artificial intelligence researches with library literature analysis method	ELECTRONIC LIBRARY			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Countermeasures; Ethical problems; Human rights ethics	TECHNOLOGY; ALGORITHM	Purpose The purpose of this paper was to identify whether artificial intelligence (AI) products can possess human rights, how to define their rights and obligations and what ethical standards they should follow. In this study, the human rights ethical dilemma encountered in the application and development of AI technology has been focused on and analyzed in detail in the light of the existing research status of AI ethics. Design/methodology/approach In this study, first of all, the development and application of AI technology, as well as the concept and characteristics of human rights ethics, are introduced. Second, the human rights ethics of AI technology are introduced in detail, including the human rights endowment of AI machines, the fault liability of AI machines and the moral orientation of AI machines. Finally, the approaches to human rights ethics are proposed to ensure that AI technology serves human beings. Every link of its research, production and application should be strictly managed and supervised. Findings The results show that the research in this study can provide help for the related problems encountered in AI practice. Intelligent library integrates human rights protection organically so that readers or users can experience more intimate service in this system. It is a kind of library operation mode with more efficient and convenient characteristics, which is based on digital, networked and intelligent information science. It aims at using the greenest way and digital means to realize the reading and research of human rights protection literature in the literature analysis method. Originality/value Intelligent library is the future development mode of new libraries, which can realize broad interconnection and sharing. It is people-oriented and can make intelligent management and service and establish the importance of the principle of human rights protection and the specific idea of the principle. The development of science and technology brings not only convenience to people's social life but also questions to be thought. People should reduce its potential harm, so as to make AI technology continue to benefit humankind.

Learning bodies: Sensory experience in the information commons	LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							ACADEMIC-LIBRARIES; SPACE; WALK; UNIVERSITY	Despite the digital shift, university libraries have grown in importance as places where students come to learn. Interest in designing better spaces has led to a flowering of user experience studies. Such research into how students use library space could usefully be informed by the theory of embodied cognition, which emphasises the role of the body in thinking and learning. This study explores students' embodied experience of an information commons building. Data were gathered from participatory walking interviews, where students were asked to give the interviewer a guided tour of the building. Findings revealed the way that particular combinations of sensory experience contributed to particular forms of learning. Very small movements or choices seem to reconfigure space significantly. This research also draws attention to the way that different learning atmospheres are actively constructed. The findings contribute a new perspective on inquiry into the use of library space. The potential implication for libraries is the need for more fine grained analysis of use experience from a sensory perspective and for teachers and learners to more explicitly reflect on the role of the body in learning.

J	Zhang, PY; Soergel, D				Zhang, Pengyi; Soergel, Dagobert			Process patterns and conceptual changes in knowledge representations during information seeking and sensemaking: A qualitative user study	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Conceptual change; information seeking; knowledge representation; learning; sensemaking	EXPLORATORY SEARCH; SENSE; MODEL; CONSTRUCTION	The construction of knowledge representations during sensemaking resembles meaningful learning in which conceptual changes to knowledge structure take place in various forms. Guided by a cognitive process model of sensemaking expanding prior models with ideas from learning and cognitive psychology, we conducted a qualitative user study of 15 participants with news writing and business analysis tasks to investigate the evolvement of their knowledge structures. We collected and analysed think-aloud protocols along with recorded screen activities, intermediate work products including notes and concept maps, and the final reports. Findings suggested that: (a) the sensemaking process can be viewed as composed of several iterations that fall into nine slightly varied common patterns, which make up the components of sensemaking; (b) conceptual changes fall into three broad classes - accretion, tuning and restructuring; and (c) changes in forms of representation seem to assist in sensemaking. These findings provide insights for system design that assists in sensemaking and intelligent use of information.

Information flows and topic modeling in corporate governance	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Corporate governance; Bibliometrics; Citation analysis; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Agency theory; Director; Interdisciplinary	INTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE; BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; COCITATION ANALYSIS; CITATION; SCIENCE; FIELD; UNIVERSITY; LOGISTICS; EVOLUTION	Purpose Multiple disciplines such as finance, management and economics have contributed to governance research over time. However, the full intellectual structure of the governance "field" including the exchange of knowledge across disciplines and the large variety of governance topics remains to be uncovered. To appreciate the breadth of corporate governance research, it is necessary to understand the disciplinary sources from which the research stems. This manuscript focuses on the interdisciplinary underpinnings of corporate governance research. Design/methodology/approach This paper employs bibliometric analysis to trace the evolution of corporate governance using articles included in the ISI Web of Science database between 1990 and 2015. Journals included in these categories encompass a full range of business disciplines and provide evidence of the multi-disciplinary nature of corporate governance. It also uncovers the topics treated by disciplines under the governance umbrella using a machine learning method called latent Dirichtlet allocation (LDA). Findings Corporate governance research deals with a number of strategy-related topics. Unlike strategy topics that reside in a single discipline, corporate governance crosses disciplinary boundaries and includes contributions from accounting, finance, economics, law and management. Our analysis shows that over 80% of corporate governance articles come from outside the field of management. Our LDA solution indicates that the major topics in governance research include corporate governance theory, control of family firms, executive compensation and audit committees. Originality/value The results illustrate that corporate governance is far more interdisciplinary than previously thought. This is an important insight for corporate governance academics and may lead to collaborative research. More importantly, this research illustrates the usefulness of LDA for investigating interdisciplinary fields. This method is easily transferable to other interdisciplinary fields and it provides a powerful alternative to existing bibliometric methods. We suggest a number of topic areas within library and information science where this method may be applied, including collection development, support for interdisciplinary faculty and basic research into emerging interdisciplinary areas.

J	Elgllab, MFM; Shehata, AMK				Elgllab, Mohammed Fathy Mahmoud; Shehata, Ahmed Maher Khafaga			Information seeking behavior in Arabic and English: A case study of scholars at Shaqra University	INFORMATION DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Information seeking behavior; cross-language information seeking; scholars; Arabic language; English language; Saudi Arabia	SEARCH PROCESS; LIBRARIES; USER	The purpose of this paper is to explore the information seeking behaviour of scholars working at Shaqra University in both Arabic and English languages; to investigate if there are differences in the way scholars seek information while using different languages; to identify challenges while seeking information and to describe the approaches followed by the scholars to seek information. The study deployed a quasi-experimental approach. The sample of the study consisted of 20 participants who are affiliated to Shaqra University. Each participant was asked to solve five tasks, which were designed to capture participants' information seeking behaviour. Think aloud protocol was also used to gather more data from the participants to enrich the collected data and to fully understand scholars' behavior. The study found that the participants' information seeking consists of four main stages: identifying the information needs, selecting the keywords, examining the results and filtering the results. The data revealed that there is no difference between information seeking in Arabic and English languages. However, participants who are from a non-Arabic background were more accustomed to searching information in the English language. There are few studies investigating information seeking behavior of Arabic language speakers. Additionally, fewer studies have tried to explore differences in information seeking behavior while using different languages. The value of the current study lies in being the first study that focuses on investigating information seeking behavior at Shaqra University. Additionally, it is one of a few studies that examine cross-language information seeking practices of Arabic language speakers and the obstacles that face them.

Wicked problems are unique, complex problems which are defined differently by different stakeholders making them particularly intractable. Data from 26 semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews with librarians was analysed to see how far their perceptions of research data management aligned with the 16 features of a wicked problem identified from the literature. To a large extent research data management is perceived to be wicked, though over time good practices may emerge to help to 'tame' the problem. How interviewees thought research data management should be approached reflected this realisation. The generic value of the concept of wicked problems is considered and some first thoughts about how the curriculum for new entrants to the profession can prepare them for such problems are presented.

However, little research has clearly explained whether incorporating design thinking into the instruction of traditional subjects affects the achievement of curriculum goals. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effects of design thinking during the instruction, in terms of reaching curriculum goals. We modified the existing design thinking framework and applied it to the information technology course. Through the experimental design and case study, we investigated how design thinking facilitated achieving the different levels of curriculum goals. Two seventh-grade classes with different instructional designs of informational technology curriculum were observed: i) one studied using the design thinking approach, and ii) another using traditional teaching methods. The results suggested that design thinking can promote the achievement of both low-level curriculum goals (i.e. mastery of the basic information knowledge and skills) and high-level curriculum goals (i.e. production of valuable, diverse, and original digital works).

J	Xie, I; Babu, R; Lee, HS; Wang, SA; Lee, TH				Xie, Iris; Babu, Rakesh; Lee, Hyun Seung; Wang, Shengang; Lee, Tae Hee			Orientation tactics and associated factors in the digital library environment: Comparison between blind and sighted users	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SEARCH TACTICS; INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; HELP-SEEKING; TASKS; MODEL; WEB; ACCESSIBILITY; EXPLORATION; DISABILITY; KNOWLEDGE	This is the first study that compares types of orientation tactics that blind and sighted users applied in their initial interactions with a digital library (DL) and the associated factors. Multiple methods were employed for data collection: questionnaires, think-aloud protocols, and transaction logs. The paper identifies seven types of orientation tactics applied by the two groups of users. While sighted users focused on skimming DL content, blind users concentrated on exploring DL structure. Moreover, the authors discovered 13 types of system, user, and interaction factors that led to the use of orientation tactics. More system factors than user factors affect blind users' tactics in browsing DL structures. The findings of this study support the social model that the sight-centered design of DLs, rather than blind users' disability, prohibits them from effectively interacting with a DL.

J	Antunes, P; Thuan, NH; Johnstone, D				Antunes, Pedro; Nguyen Hoang Thuan; Johnstone, David			Nature and purpose of visual artifacts in design science research	INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND E-BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Visual artifacts; Design science; Design knowledge; Visualization of thought	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; FRAMEWORK; KNOWLEDGE; METHODOLOGY; MODEL; PRINCIPLES; SENSE; COLLABORATION; ARCHITECTURE	Design science is a recognized information systems research paradigm, which is fundamentally centered on problem solving through technology design. The design process involves reflexive thinking and exploration and is usually supported by a variety of visual artifacts, which facilitate structuring, combining, and communicating design knowledge. Visual artifacts are among possible main contributions of a design science endeavor. In this study, we analyze the nature and purpose of such visual artifacts. We adopt semiotics and a theory of visualization of thought, in combination with a literature review, to elaborate a framework of design science visual artifacts. We consider three domains of analysis: intentionality, form-and-function, and visual scheme. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework using two examples. Finally, we define a set of properties that researchers should consider when creating and using visual artifacts in design science: transparency of the relationship between representation and object, self-sufficiency of the visual artifact, and consistency of knowledge communication. The proposed framework helps researchers understand what properties should be focused on when developing their visual artifacts.

Although there are various schools of thought and different ways of obtaining information for measurement, one of the most favorable proposals today in the development of measuring instruments is the use of the researcher's Curriculum Vitae. The objective of this research is to design a system of indicators to measure the performance of science, technology and innovation in universities. The proposal includes specific analysis for the definition of each indicator, the mathematical procedure for its calculation, aggregation levels and time periods, as well as its meaning and usefulness. The study compiles documentary analysis of the theoretical and conceptual references that support the proposal in the Latin American context. Furthermore, an empirical survey method is proposed to assess specific contexts in the institution under study. As a result, the design of a system of indicators adjusted to the characteristics of university institutions and current trends in the Latin American region is achieved. The use and analysis of these indicators allow us to establish patterns, trends and regularities in the organization that favour institutional knowledge management on science, technology and innovation processes; and deliver adequate information management and institutional knowledge for decision-making.

ELECTRONIC LIBRARY			English	Article						Bangladesh; Discovery tools; OPACs; Koha; VuFind	ONLINE CATALOG; USABILITY; HARD	Purpose - The aim of this paper was to compare university students' preferences for searching the library catalogue via the library's Koha online public access catalogue (OPAC) or its discovery tool VuFind. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 175 students responded to a questionnaire-based survey through which their demographic data, duration (years) of computer use and their self-reported levels of computer skills were obtained. Students were asked what interfaces they use for catalogue searching and to rate their opinion on the relevant interfaces on a seven-point Likert scale. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to statistically compare the differences between students' demographic/individual characteristics and their ratings on the respective interfaces. For those students who used both systems, differences between their Likert ratings were assessed using a one-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test. Findings - The results showed that there were no significant differences among students in terms of their ratings on either the OPAC or VuFind interfaces. Wilcoxon signed ranks test indicated that significantly more students thought that VuFind was more usable than the Koha OPAC. Originality/value - This is a pioneering study of the current use of the OPAC and discovery tools by university students and their preferences for searching catalogue information through these systems. It is hoped that the findings of this study will encourage researchers to conduct task-based usability studies with various cataloguing tools and this could yield new and improved interaction designs for library catalogue searching.

J	Catanese, A				Catanese, Anthony			Judaica Librarianship: Back to the Future	LIBRI-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION STUDIES			English	Article; Early Access						information behavior; information retrieval; Judaic studies; Judaica librarianship; Library of Congress Classification		The Library of Congress Classification system was designed during the age of colonialism, and as such, poorly represents the information-seeking behavior of present-day users. Students of Judaica are especially hindered by the limited scope of the B class (Philosophy and Religion) of the Library of Congress Classification system, which extensively classifies Christian material, but limits the thematic classification of Judaic subjects. Qualitative data collected on students of Jewish thought via a proposed questionnaire is anticipated to shed light on the specialized information-seeking behavior of Judaic students. The thematic coding and analysis of such data would assist in selecting an appropriate classification system that will complement Judaica scholarship or facilitate the creation of a novel classification system. More inclusively, such an endeavor may contribute to the understanding of specialized efforts in librarianship.

JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Information use; task accomplishment; user expectation		Information systems have been improving in helping users find information. However, they have been less attended to regarding helping searchers in using located information. This research attempts to address the issue of information use by investigating what information systems and features searchers think are helpful in using located information to accomplish information tasks. In all, 32 college students were invited to an information interaction lab, first being interviewed on a recently completed task and then working on a to-be-finished task, both being their real-life tasks of their own choices. Through questionnaires, the study discovered the most favoured existing and expected features helpful for users' task completion. Users expected convenient citations, note taking in search result pages and being kept on task. Findings in this study have implications on designing search systems that can better support task accomplishment, in addition to returning search results.

Engineers Code: Reusable Open Learning Modules for Engineering Computations	COMPUTING IN SCIENCE & ENGINEERING			English	Article						Python; Education; Licenses; Programming profession; Arrays; Libraries	SCIENCE	Undergraduate programs in science and engineering include at least one course in basic programming, but seldom presented in a contextualized format, where computing is a tool for thinking and learning in the discipline. We have created a series of learning modules to embed computing in engineering education, and share this content under permissive public licenses. The modules are created as a set of lessons using Jupyter notebooks, and complemented by online courses in the Open edX platform, using new integrations we developed. Learning sequences in the online course pull content dynamically from public Jupyter notebooks and assessments are autograded on-the-fly, using our Jupyter Viewer and Jupyter Grader third-party extensions for Open edX. The learning content is modularized and designed for reuse in various formats. In one of these formats-short but intense workshops-our university library is leveraging the curriculum to offer extracurricular training for all, at high demands.

Specifically, the study explores the kind of information librarians seek or share in a virtual community. The study also explores how librarians react to the shared or sought-for information in a virtual community. This study was carried out on 50 librarians in community of practice on a WhatsApp platform. Netnography as a research design was used in this study. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis techniques. The findings show that librarians share information that encourage and support one another. The findings also show that librarians share and seek related information on career and institutional work, thought-provoking information and personality quotes. In reaction to the shared information, librarians peruse shared information for their authenticity. Librarians share appreciative messages in reaction to the sharing of important and educative information. In the situation of misinformation or where suspicious information is shared, librarians counter the shared information in reaction by posting messages cautioning librarians to beware of scam.

J	Freeburg, D				Freeburg, Darin			A Knowledge Lens for information literacy: conceptual framework and case study	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Information literacy; Innovation; Complexity; Knowledge management; Communities of practice; Race relations	ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE; COMMUNITIES; SCIENCE; PEOPLE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce a Knowledge Lens for information literacy. This lens shifts the focus and potential outcomes of information literacy in three ways. First, it promotes self-reflection as a means of integrating information. Second, it promotes creation, emphasizing it as a social process. Third, it promotes the ability and value of working with imprecision and lack of direction. Design/methodology/approach - The author designed a Community of Practice (CoP) with a loosely structured guidebook to operationalize the Knowledge Lens. The initial stated purpose of the CoP was to provide innovative solutions to issues of race relations in South Carolina. A group of 19 participants - representing four churches - met twice a month for one year. After one year, a core group of 6 participants were interviewed to identify elements of this new lens. Findings - Participants indicated that they changed in many ways after the CoP, suggesting that the Knowledge Lens increases the impact of literacy work. In particular, they were able to utilize internal tension to spark innovation, found value in direct engagement with one another without the need to first codify their thinking, and increased their reliance on information encountering. Originality/value - Information literacy has attempted to move beyond stale concepts, and the Knowledge Lens facilitates this movement. It takes information literacy beyond the mere provision of access to existing information. It recognizes barriers to information integration. And it involves individuals in co-creation to solve problems that lack an existing codified solution.

However, there is little awareness that consumers may not be able to process all the information available because of human beings' limited information processing capacity. Online shoppers could be easily confused when facing rich information, particularly when the amount of information greatly exceeds their processing capacity. In contrast to previous research which has focused on the formatting of information or user interfaces to solve the information overload problem, this study explores a new solution based on the role of unconscious thought Integrating information processing theory and the unconscious thought theory, the current study examines the different roles of information quantity, information quality and thought mode in consumers' decision satisfaction, in the presence of rich information. Our results show that unconscious thought moderates the relationship between information quality and consumer satisfaction towards their decision making when shopping experience products online, and is thus worthy of special attention in the design of e-commerce websites. The study contributes to both unconscious thought theory and information processing theory by exploring the interaction effect of the quantity and quality of information with thought mode in affecting the quality of purchasing decisions.

J	Westbrook, L				Westbrook, Lynn			Mental models: a theoretical overview and preliminary study	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive framework; information system design; information seeking; academic libraries; sense making	INFORMATION-SEEKING; SEARCH; INTERNET; WEB; USABILITY; SCIENCE; THINK	Within the socio-cognitive framework of sense-making, this paper explicates the term 'mental model' and its associated concepts, analyzes the controversies and connections pertaining to mental model research in information studies, and reports the findings of an exploratory study of the mental models of an academic information system. As one aspect of the process of making sense out of their experiences, individuals develop mental models of the systems and processes with which they interact. These models include (1) key components, (2) relationships between those components, and (3) techniques for interacting with the system or process. The small-scale study discussed here identifies three distinct patterns across the models of information seeking held by graduate students in a reference course.

The use of secondary materials is an essential part of circular economy and it is in a central role in EU's action plans. This paper examines, how a Circular Material Library can be used as tool of user oriented design to promote regional circular economy, innovation and competencies in companies. The Circular Material Library differs from the existing material libraries in that it will focus on available recycled materials. Due to the increased understanding of materials, new symbiosis products and industrial symbiosis networks can be created. Especially SME's would benefit from this public tool.

To cope with these characteristics, teams usually start doing something by drawing on their current store of experiences and professional knowledge, and then (re-)assess the outcomes produced, and adjust future actions based on insights obtained during the process. In reflecting on actions, tacit knowledge is revealed that enables designers to handle challenging situations. Although there is great potential to support design thinking by adding a reflection lens, we lack guidance on how, when, and on what to perform reflection. Based on scientific and theoretical literature, semi-structured interviews, a case study and a software prototype, prescriptive design knowledge on how to integrate reflection into design thinking is deduced, which enriches the scarce body of knowledge at the intersection of reflection and (digital) design thinking.

This project sought to assess the impact of programmatic changes and librarian course integration on students' information literacy (IL) skills. Using an IL rubric to score student papers (n = 337) over three consecutive first-year student cohorts, our study shows that when faculty collaborate with librarians to foster IL competencies, the result is a statistically significant improvement in students' demonstrated research skills. Our study also reveals a collaboration "sweet spot": the greatest gains accrue when librarians provide moderate input into syllabus and assignment design, followed by one or two strategically placed hands-on library sessions. Successful collaboration thus need not entail completely overhauling content courses so as to make library instruction the centerpiece. Quite the opposite, librarians can help reduce the potential burden on faculty by supporting discipline- and course-specific research goals, as well as by sharing resources and best practices in IL pedagogy.

Two curriculum units are discussed: Exploring Scientific Literature and Design Your Own General Chemistry Laboratory Experiment. The modules' sequentially develop and expand upon students' chemical literacy, including the use of scientific literature to support experiment design. Student success is dependent on developing and using information literacy in service to critical thinking and practical analytical problem solving. A longitudinal study of students participating in this project surveyed self-assessed attitudes and beliefs. Initial findings suggest that introducing the scientific literature and building information literacy skills in first-year chemistry courses provide immediate and long-term benefits to student performance and engagement in the sciences.

The focal objective of this research was to investigate how different types of end users (i.e. pupils, students, the working population, seniors and researchers) respond to a library website in terms of its effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction, which together represent its usability. The answers were obtained by performing formal usability testing, including think-aloud protocol, log analysis and questionnaires. The results of the statistical analysis show that different groups of end users achieve different levels of effectiveness and efficiency, while there is no significant difference between groups in satisfaction level. The results also indicate that participants did not achieve the threshold for a usable website. Based on the identified weaknesses, researchers present recommendations for improving a website's usefulness, especially for non-experienced users. This research has two main contributions: (1) the connection between the theoretical definition and practical use of ISO 9241-11 attributes and (2) a usability testing procedure with a measurement framework applicable for different types of users in a specific domain, which could be applied to other domains.

CT is most commonly used in science and technology fields such as computer science and mathematics, whereas DT is more commonly used in the design field. This study evaluates the impact of art programming education on college art students using both methods of thinking to identify the relationship between CT and DT. In total, 27 junior students from an art programming course for a digital media class were chosen as the study's participants. According to the study's findings, the art programming course was shown to improve students' programming attitude (PA) in terms of both DT and CT. Although the correlation analysis found no significant difference between DT and CT, the data showed that both were related to student grades. The findings of this study confirm the efficacy of programming in improving students' abilities in DT and CT. It also confirms the importance of the two distinct types of thinking, DT and CT, in the problem-solving process, which serves as the foundation for creative design.

Data was collected during the system interaction of IS graduate students with SIFTER (Smart Information Filtering Technology for Electronic Resources), a filtering system that ranks incoming information based on users' profiles. The data set came from a collection of 6000 records concerning consumer health. In the first phase of the study, three different modes of profile acquisition were compared. The explicit mode allowed users to directly specify the profile, the implicit mode utilized relevance feedback to create and refine the profile, and the combined mode allowed users to initialize the profile and to continuously refine it using relevance feedback. Filtering performance, measured in terms of Normalized Precision, showed that [lie three approaches were significantly different (alpha = 0.05 and p = 0.012). The explicit mode of profile acquisition consistently produced superior results. Exclusive reliance on relevance feedback in the implicit mode resulted in inferior performance. The low performance obtained by the implicit acquisition mode motivated the second phase of the study, which aimed to clarify the role of context in relevance feedback judgments. An inductive content analysis of thinking aloud protocols showed dimensions that were highly situational, establishing the importance context plays in feedback relevance assessments. Results suggest the need for better representation of documents, profiles, and relevance feedback mechanisms that incorporate dimensions identified in this research. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A phenomenological scheme for information organization	INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Conceptions of Library and Information Science (CoLIS)	JUN 16-19, 2019	Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, SLOVENIA		Univ Ljubljana			Introduction. The organization of information and knowledge is one of the essential concerns of librarianship and information studies. To say that the organization of information is challenging is a truism, and the discipline has been attempting that challenge for centuries. This paper explores the nature of this challenge and makes suggestions for addressing it. Analysis. Recent attempts to conceive of organization represent advances in the idea of enhancing the ability of seekers to retrieve information. For example, the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) and Resource Description and Analysis (RDA) are efforts aimed at replacing former standards and guidelines for cataloging informational objects and helping users gain access to the objects. FRBR and RDA represent altered ways of thinking about the description of objects, and one purpose is the identification of works and instantiations of works. Conclusions. The proposed paper will build upon Smith's ideas, in which entropy inheres, to suggest a naturalistic design for organization (one that incorporates cultural objects and subjects of intentional activity).

Design/methodology/approach Music-related information is approached through six modes that categorize music information sources based on their levels of abstraction. Situational relevance of the modes of music information is examined in relation to the situational requirements of accomplishing a dissertation on music task consisting of both a series of concerts and a written thesis. The empirical material was collected by interviewing Finnish doctoral students in the field of music performance. Findings A set of situational relevance types related to each mode of music information were identified. As a whole, the differences between the perceived importance of the modes varied a little. Research limitations/implications The goal of the present paper is not to create a generalizable list of situational relevance types suggested by modes of music information, but to show that the modes may suggest diverse situational relevance types of their own when evaluated by performing musicians. Originality/value The present paper provides a rare account on performing musicians' vocational and school-related information seeking. For studies of music information retrieval, the present paper offers new contextual facets explaining why diverse music information could be relevant to musicians. For studies of music-related information seeking, the present study offers new insights on why performing musicians have information needs regarding certain types of music information sources.

It also provides suggestions for future systems development. Design/methodology/approach - This study implements a cloud bookcase and uses the IS success model to evaluate user intention and satisfaction with the system. It also develops a success model for the cloud bookcase. Findings - The results of study indicate that user satisfaction and intention with regard to using the system are positively related to net benefits. In other words, increasing user satisfaction and intention with regard to using the system will have a positive effect on the benefits users receive from doing so. Practical implications - Users think the functions and services of the cloud bookcase can indeed help them search for and organize information about electronic books. However, they are not satisfied with the information quality. Therefore, further work is needed to identify any important factors that this study did not investigate. This study suggests that the quality of a system's functions and guide service have to be upgraded in order to increase user satisfaction with and intention to use the system. Originality/value - This study implements a cloud bookcase and uses the IS success model for verification. An overall explanatory power of 77.9 percent is achieved with this approach. User satisfaction with and intention to use the system are independent from each other, and the results caused by various factors can be separately identified. The findings of this study have considerable practical value.

Using information literacy to teach medical entrepreneurship and health care economics	JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION			English	Article							LIBRARY INSTRUCTION; CRITICAL THINKING; STUDENTS; IMPACT; INNOVATION; SKILLS	Objective: Entrepreneurship and innovative product design in health care requires expertise in finding and evaluating diverse types of information from a multitude of sources to accomplish a number of tasks, such as securing regulatory approval, developing a reimbursement strategy, and navigating intellectual property. The authors sought to determine whether an intensive, specialized information literacy training program that introduced undergraduate biomedical engineering students to these concepts would improve the quality of the students' design projects. We also sought to test whether information literacy training that included active learning exercises would offer increased benefits over training delivered via lectures and if this specialized information literacy training would increase the extent of students' information use. Methods: A three-arm cohort study was conducted with a control group and two experimental groups. Mixed methods assessment, including a rubric and citation analysis, was used to evaluate program outcomes by examining authentic artifacts of student learning. Results: Student design teams that received information literacy training on topics related to medical entrepreneurship and health care economics showed significantly improved performance on aspects of project performance relevant to health care economics over student design teams that did not receive this training. There were no significant differences between teams that engaged in active learning exercises and those that only received training via lectures. Also, there were no significant differences in citation patterns between student teams that did or did not receive specialized information literacy training. Conclusions: Information literacy training can be used as a method for introducing undergraduate health sciences students to the health care economics aspects of the medical entrepreneurship life cycle, including the US Food and Drug Administration regulatory environment, intellectual property, and medical billing and reimbursement structures.

The better one understands contextual factors affecting use and interaction, the more effectively one can use design thinking to address issues at the context and greater systems levels. This article examines how the cognitive science concepts of scripts and prototypes can help realize the potential of design thinking in different settings. Method: This article compares design thinking approaches for understanding context to concepts of context as examined in the cognitive mechanisms of prototypes and scripts. Through this comparison, the author explains how to integrate scripts and prototypes into design thinking processes in order to enhance understandings of context and the success of design thinking approaches to context-related problems. Results: The article reveals that prototypes and scripts can expand design thinking approaches and enhance the development of design solutions for addressing problems at local and greater systems levels. Conclusions: Technical communicators can use the approach presented here to enhance design thinking processes in order to better address problems in or design products for specific contexts.

J	Tu, JC; Liu, LX; Wu, KY				Tu, Jui-Che; Liu, Li-Xia; Wu, Kuan-Yi			Study on the Learning Effectiveness of Stanford Design Thinking in Integrated Design Education	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Stanford Design Thinking; creativity; creative thinking teaching; action research		Due to industrial demand and the influence of government policies, the number of design colleges and students specializing in design in Taiwan has been increasing year by year. As a result, the topics on design education have gained great attention. To adapt to the rapidly-changing society, training that is designed to strengthen the professionalism and integration ability of those design majors should also be adjusted. Unlike traditional teaching methods, Stanford Design Thinking is a people-oriented problem-solving method. Proceeding from human needs, it offers creative solutions to various topics. Placing emphasis on integrated team communication and the cooperation and exchange among interdisciplinary talents, it is a new teaching model in response to the changes to the design environment. In this study, Stanford Design Thinking was introduced to the integrated design curriculum education as a creativity teaching strategy, and the action research method was adopted to explore the learning effectiveness of the design thinking method. According to the findings, the design thinking method can improve teaching; it can promote student participation through interview training in class during the Empathize stage; it offers substantial assistance to students in actual interviews; it reveals information about the demands of target groups, deepens students' discussions on design-related topics, and creates a favorable atmosphere for teaching; it fosters a positive interaction between students and teachers and makes students more attentive in class. Inspired by this teaching method, students can independently seek product-testing objects to review their design concepts and develop a stronger motivation for self-learning.

J	Stevens, LL; Whitehead, C; Singhal, A				Stevens, Laura Lee; Whitehead, Celina; Singhal, Asha			Cultivating Cooperative Relationships: Identifying Learning Gaps When Teaching Students Systems Thinking Biomimicry	BIOMIMETICS			English	Article						biomimicry; systems thinking; pedagogy; design thinking; science education; biology	DESIGN; SUSTAINABILITY; BIOMIMETICS	The methodology of biomimicry design thinking is based on and builds upon the overarching patterns that all life abides by. "Cultivating cooperative relationships" within an ecosystem is one such pattern we as humans can learn from to nurture our own mutualistic and symbiotic relationships. While form and process translations from biology to design have proven accessible by students learning biomimicry, the realm of translating biological functions in a systematic approach has proven to be more difficult. This study examines how higher education students can approach the gap that many companies in transition are struggling with today; that of thinking within the closed loops of their own ecosystem, to do good without damaging the system itself. Design students should be able to assess and advise on product design choices within such systems after graduation. We know when tackling a design challenge, teams have difficulties sifting through the mass of information they encounter, and many obstacles are encountered by students and their professional clients when trying to implement systems thinking into their design process. While biomimicry offers guidelines and methodology, there is insufficient research on complex, systems-level problem solving that systems thinking biomimicry requires. This study looks at factors found in course exercises, through student surveys and interviews that helped (novice) professionals initiate systems thinking methods as part of their strategy. The steps found in this research show characteristics from student responses and matching educational steps which enabled them to develop their own approach to challenges in a systems thinking manner. Experiences from the 2022 cohort of the semester "Design with Nature" within the Industrial Design Engineering program at The Hague University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands have shown that the mixing and matching of connected biological design strategies to understand integrating functions and relationships within a human system is a promising first step.

J	Cole, C; Mandelblatt, B; Stevenson, J				Cole, C; Mandelblatt, B; Stevenson, J			Visualizing a high recall search strategy output for undergraduates in an exploration stage of researching a term paper	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cartographic maps; information retrieval; information visualization; information seeking; information need	INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; AUTHOR COCITATION; SCIENCE; DESIGN; SEEKING; FOCUS; MODEL; NEED; MAP	When accessing an information retrieval system, it has long been said that undergraduates who are in an exploratory stage of researching their essay topic should use a high recall search strategy; what prevents them from doing so is the information overload factor associated with showing the undergraduate a long list of citations. One method of overcoming information overload is summarizing and visualizing the citation list. This paper examines five summarization and visualization schemes for presenting information retrieval (IR) citation output, then discusses whether these schemes are appropriate for undergraduates and other domain novice users. We ask and answer four questions: (1) What is the message these schemes try to communicate and (2) is this message appropriate for domain novice users like undergraduates? (3) How do these schemes communicate their message and (4) is how they communicate the message appropriate for a domain novice? We conclude that (i) the most appropriate message for information space visualizations for domain novice users is associative thinking, and (ii) the message should be communicated with a standardized look that remains relatively constant over time so that the shape and form of the visualization can become familiar and thus useful to students as they navigate their way through the information space produced by a high recall search strategy.

The practice of incorporating animals into research is not straightforward because they do not share our language or norms. The question this research aims to answer is: how can the perspective of other animal subjects be incorporated in information behavior research? This preliminary study of four multispecies families, included humans, dogs, and cats in the research design, and a more-than-human perspective was used as a research paradigm, offering different ways of thinking about ethnography and phenomenology methods. Five methodological strategies (speaking for the animal, listening differently, walking and sensing, photography, and technological mediation) proved effective in making the role of animals in the information experience of multispecies family visible. The article concludes with a discussion of the methodological implications that emerge when a researcher claims to view humans as conjoined with other life forms and seeks to include animals in information behavior research.

Research gaps in routine health information system design barriers to data quality and use in low- and middle-income countries: A literature review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Review						health information systems; health policy; health services; public health informatics	DECISION-MAKING; PUBLIC-HEALTH; CARE; IMPLEMENTATION; LEVEL; MODEL	Despite the potential impact of health information system (HIS) design barriers on health data quality and use and, ultimately, health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), no comprehensive literature review has been conducted to study them in this context. We therefore conducted a formal literature review to understand system design barriers to data quality and use in LMICs and to identify any major research gaps related understanding how system design affects data use. We conducted an electronic search across 4 scientific databasesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Global Healthand consulted a data use expert. Following a systematic inclusion and exclusion process, 316 publications (316 abstracts and 18 full papers) were included in the review. We found a paucity of scientific publications that explicitly describe system design factors that hamper data quality or data use for decision making. Although user involvement, work flow, human-computer interactions, and user experience are critical aspects of system design, our findings suggest that these issues are not discussed or conceptualized in the literature. Findings also showed that individual training efforts focus primarily on imparting data analysis skills. The adverse impact of HIS design barriers on data integrity and health system performance may be even bigger in LMICs than elsewhere, leading to errors in population health management and clinical care. We argue for integrating systems thinking into HIS strengthening efforts to reduce the HIS design-user reality gap.

Although protocol analysis is a widely used method for understanding the nature of the design thought process, its application on multi-disciplinary design projects is not easy due to its limited capability for interrelating every action recorded in the entire process referring to various types of information. To solve this problem, the paper proposed a method that records and analyses the design thought process as time variation in parameter network. A case study is provided to discuss the feasibility of the method. (C) 2016 CIRP.

This study is the first attempt to investigate the top three help-seeking situations as well as associated factors in blind users' DL interactions. A mixed-method approach was adopted for this study. Multiple methods were applied to collect data from 30 blind subjects: questionnaires, presearch interviews, think aloud protocols, transaction logs, and postsearch interviews. The paper identifies the top three help-seeking situations, and associated factors in relation to user, system, task, and interaction. Moreover, different types of main-level factors were tested to investigate if they are correlated to each type of top situation, and qualitative data of sublevel factors offer insight into how these factors are associated with various situations. Without a clear understanding of these situations and factors, the objective of universal access to information in DLs cannot be achieved. DL design implications are further discussed with the goal of providing system design recommendations for reducing blind users' help-seeking situations.

J	Liu, A; Lu, S				Liu, Ang; Lu, Stephen			Functional design framework for innovative design thinking in product development	CIRP JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Design method; Design thinking; Functional design; Design education; Product development	QUALITY FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT; CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; KANO MODEL; REQUIREMENTS; FIELD	Functional design means the process of formulating a unique design problem by mapping a set of customer needs to a set of functional requirements. In the context of product development, functional design is one of the most challenging but rewarding design activities. On the one hand, designers must extract useful information from a large amount of diversified, unstructured, and even inconsistent customer voices. On the other hand, designers must formulate a set of functional requirements that are inherently intangible, solution-neutral, and arguably subjective. Functional design exerts great impacts on the formation of innovative design thinking. It is especially difficult for novice designers who are naturally inclined to rapidly dive into the solution space with little exploration of the problem space. This paper presents a systematic functional design framework to guide novice designers, through a step-bystep process, to sequentially investigate the customer domain, explore the functional domain, and manage design couplings between customer needs and functional requirements. A collection of existing design methods is incorporated, in an adaptive manner, into the framework to facilitate the execution of each step. To date, the proposed framework has been iteratively taught, practiced, and refined based on two engineering design courses since 2013. (c) 2020 CIRP.

For this purpose, design thinking, an innovative approach, was employed in the present study. In this context, a module based on design thinking on energy transformations was developed and implemented to 7th-grade students. In addition, the development of students' model-based explanations on the topic of energy transformations was examined. In the study designed as a design-based empirical research, pre-and post-model-based explanations created by students were used as data collection tools. Two rubrics were developed for components and sequences as elements of model-based explanations, benefiting from expert opinions for data analysis. As a result of the implementation of design thinking, it was revealed that the level of the components that the students used in relation to the concepts falling under energy transformations and of the sequences they established, in short, their model-based explanations improved. The current study contributes to the literature by providing information on how the design thinking approach supports the development of middle school students' model-based explanations about energy transformations.

With that increased activity comes a need to understand how, why, for whom, and with what level of impact design thinking has been used. Many health projects receive public funding, and those that include design thinking approaches may thus be subject to evaluation more typically used in traditional biomedical research, with the potential for errors in translation between disciplines. The present paper considers the limitations and potential to further incorporate the two disciplinary approaches in order to improve progress in achieving health equity and improving population-level health outcomes.

The factors analyzed by the authors assess five dimensions: technology incentives, technology utilization, searching skills, social integration, and capabilities. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 329 respondents in 14 public libraries and analyzed using structural equation modeling to validate the proposed research model and its relationships with the factors the authors analyzed. Findings The results showed that technological incentives significantly impact on technology utilization, searching skills, social integration, and capabilities to support community digital inclusion in Pakistan. Practical implications Technological incentives to the community will lead to the improvement of network technology for things like online taxation, banking transactions, social integration, participation in government, and modern health and education benefits. In addition, technological incentives will also enhance information literacy and digital access, helping people improve cognitive skills and critical thinking and also helping to develop skills. Originality/value This research is based on raw data first collected from various people with different opinions from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa public libraries. This study was conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the overall situation related to the use of technology in Pakistan and the complications involved.	[Islam, A. Y. M.

This study presents an innovative project-based cloud learning (PBCL) model which integrates various Google services in order to enhance critical thinking abilities in human-computer interface design. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed SNS collaborative teaching model for HCI design, the one-group pretest-posttest experiment was adopted in a university HCI design course in Taiwan. Participants included 32 technical and vocational university students aged 20-22, all major in information science. The collected data is used to explore the change in students' critical thinking skills. Additionally, this study also adopts an interview survey to collect qualitative data. There are 11 groups in this course, and the 11 respondents were randomly selected from these groups after the course. The results indicate that the practice of PBCL could help students to develop critical thinking skills rather than disposition. More specifically, the differences of low initial disposition group's pre-test and post-test of CTD and CTS were significant. The qualitative interview results reveal that experimental subjects hold a positive view on integrating SNS and various Google services to human-computer interface course to enhance project design and critical thinking skills. It implies that the PBCL model is an innovative and practical teaching model to be beneficial to learners with low initial interest. In addition, it helps students deepen impression of learning content and inspire new ideas.

As an interdisciplinary method for visualizing complex data, creating data visualizations requires learners to analyze data from knowledge of pure and applied science. This study investigates creating DV to facilitate CT as an interdisciplinary method which combines mathematics and information technology. The study was carried out using synthesised design-based research (DBR) method by conducting two cycles comprised of five phases: problem analysis within real-life context, design solution, develop solution, evaluate in practice and reflection. CT dimensions (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm design) were tested by using the Computational Thinking through Data Visualization Rubric and reflection form acquired during implementation. The sample consisted of secondary school students in the data visualization creation process with 27 in the first cycle and 31 in the second cycle. This research proposes a model to facilitate development of CT by DV with the analysis of complex data, creating an effective method by enabling analytics and visualizing data. The proposed DV development process facilitating CT has the potential to inform research on interdisciplinary learning environments.

We do this by capturing think-aloud protocols from experienced design professionals who are given access to potentially useful design principles. Our analysis identifies two dimensions of use: design behaviors (what designers do) and application modes (how designers apply the principles). Mapping across the dimensions suggests two use pathways: forward chaining and backward chaining. Our study shows how empirically studying expert designers can shed light on the microprocesses of design principles in use, and how an empirical turn in the investigation can contribute to clarifying the fundamental nature of design principles. We conclude by highlighting the implications of these insights for crafting more useful design principles.

Toward replication study types for design science research	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Design science research; replication; design theory; confidence; knowledge accumulation; design reuse	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; SUPPORT-SYSTEMS; PRINCIPLES; EVOLUTION	In design science research, two important challenges exist to achieve greater influence in research and practice: (1) foster frequent reuse of artifacts and design theories and (2) increase knowledge accumulation in the field. In this article, we argue that replication studies could support the accumulation and development of design theories to reach a state that encourages reuse of artifacts and design theories. However, it is unclear precisely how replication relates to design science research-that is, what outcomes replication produces and how researchers should apply it within design science research. This study proposes three overarching research questions (Does the artifact provide utility? Is the design theory complete? What design theory components fit a larger context?) and eight categories for replication studies in design science research (Test, Redesign, Justification, Adaptation, Explanation, Update, Recreation, and Meta-Replication). We offer guidance to researchers, editors, and reviewers on how to conduct replication studies in design science research and why such studies are so critical. Our goal is to provide "food for thought" on the significance of design science research replication studies and, in turn, help facilitate their widespread implementation and publication. We conclude our study by highlighting areas for further discussion and investigation, such as defining replication procedures and conceptualizing genuine replication goals within design science research.

Findings suggest that although HCD is valuable within the realm of research, the integration of HCD processes in practice inhibited the successful finalization of a design outcome, within a library setting. Considering this, tensions are confirmed between the design in practice and the democracy embedded within HCD. By recognizing identified tensions, suggestions are made to better accommodate the divergent roles of the designer and community participant - allowing each to remain a specialist within their designated fields.

J	López, DR; Gómez-Acebo, JLB				Romero Lopez, Dolores; Bueren Gomez-Acebo, Jose Luis			Networking women translators in Spain (1868-1936) and their presence in the <i>Mnemosyne</i> digital library	ELECTRONIC LIBRARY			English	Article						Digital humanities; Mnemosyne; Spanish women translators; Womens issues	HISTORY; GENDER	Purpose Studies of Spanish literature during the late nineteenth century and the first one-third of the twentieth century are evolving from research on canonical writers to the study of odd and forgotten authors, themes and genres during what is now called the Other Silver Age. This paper aims to focus on the work undertaken in the field of literary translation by the women writers of this period. Design/methodology/approach Mnemosyne is an open-access digital library that allows data modeling for specific collections (women translators, science fiction, etc.) in support of research and teaching on Silver Age Spain. The first version of the library is stored on the server at the Universidad Complutense Library, and it is linked to the collections of the digital library HathiTrust and Biblioteca Nacional de Espana. Behind the scenes of Mnemosyne's public presence online, the project is developing with the aid of the tool Clavy which is a rich internet application that is able to import, preserve and edit information from big data collections of digital objects so as to build bridges between institutional and digital repositories and create collections of enriched digital content. See:http://repositorios.fdi.ucm.es/mnemosine/queesmnemosine.php Findings The Collection Women Translators in Spain (1868-1936) inside Mnemosyne selects, categorizes and makes visible in digital format women translators and literary translations that belong to a forgotten repertoire to allow the historical review of the period. The digital collection of Spanish Women Translators pretends to be a field of international experimentation for the creation of interoperable semantic networks through which a large group of scholars could generate innovative research and theoretical reading models for literary texts. See:http://repositorios.fdi.ucm.es/mnemosine/colecciones.php Research limitations/implicationsClavy also provides a basic system of data visualization, edition and navigation. There are plans to integrate @Note, a collaborative annotation application, into Clavy. These two computational tools were developed by the software languages research group ILSA[1] at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Practical implications Its been followed NEWW Women Writers' categories concerning biographical categories as successful standard for ensuring interoperability in the near future: children, marital status, social class, religion, profession and other activities, financial aspects, memberships. See:http://repositorios.fdi.ucm.es/mnemosine/ver_documento.php?documento=208369 Social implications These women also showed their interest in the writings of contemporary women by translating their works into Spanish or glossing foreign ideas about how the modern woman should be, think or behave. This digital collection shows the first steps of the intellectual women in the South of Europe. Originality/value To incorporate specially tailored metadata for the women translators' collection into Mnemosyne, it will be necessary to use of Clavy's extensibility to account for the particularities of the women translators' collection. This is where prior knowledge of this literature's historical and cultural context proves indispensable. In particular, the specific metadata model for the women translators' collection incorporates elements that reflect the literary, historical and cultural characteristics of the collections.

However, because virtually anyone can publish this type of information on the Web, consumers cannot always rely on traditional credibility cues such as reputation of a journal. Instead, they must rely on a variety of cues, including visual presentation, to determine the veracity of information. This study is an examination of the relationship of people's visual design preferences to judgments of credibility of information on consumer health information sites. Subjects were asked to rate their preferences for visual designs of 31 health information sites after a very brief viewing. The sites were then reordered and subjects rated them according to the extent to which they thought the information on the sites was credible. Visual design judgments bore a statistically significant similarity to credibility ratings. Sites with known brands were also highly rated for both credibility and visual design. Theoretical implications are discussed.

J	Day, RE				Day, Ronald E.			Documentation to Documentality in the works of Michael Buckland	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article; Early Access						Information; Documentation; Documentality; Information-as-thing; Michael K; Buckland; Neo-documentation		PurposeMichael Buckland's works have spanned theoretical, historical and practice-oriented foci and genre. This article focuses on some of his theoretical-historical works that span over 20 years, which demonstrate a reading and critique of European Documentation in terms of what has been called "Documentality." This turn to a philosophy of information called "Documentality" marks the moment of "neo-documentation." This article surveys this moment in Buckland's works by reading his articles "Information as Thing," "What is a 'Document'?", and "Documentality Beyond Documents." It shows the transition from Documentation as a philosophy of information as representation to Documentality as a philosophy of information as function and performance. Some concepts and works of Bruno Latour are used to illuminate this transition from Documentation to Documentality. Implications and further research directions are discussed at the end.Design/methodology/approachConceptual and historical analyses.FindingsThe article follows a neo-documentalist transition in Buckland's works in the thinking of documents from an Otletian representationalist epistemology ("Documentation") to a functionalist and performative epistemology ("Documentality") for documents.Research limitations/implicationsThis is a conceptual work on a limited corpus in Buckland's oeuvre. It has a limited discussion of Documentality in the works of other writers, namely the works of Bernd Frohmann and Maurizio Ferraris.Practical implicationsThe article points to historical shifts in the study of documents in Library and Information Science.Social implicationsDocumentality critically and materially studies documents in sociotechnical information management systems and elsewhere.Originality/valueThis work highlights the importance of the above works and the importance of the neo-documentalist perspective of Documentality.

In this paper, we proposed a new concept, namely fog learning with the aim of addressing the critical thinking as a demanding issue in academic area. Due to the distributed architecture of our fog learning model, it can be used anywhere, anytime, and with the minimum latency in comparison with the existing mobile and cloud learning models to foster the critical thinking. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, we applied the Software Usability Measurement Inventory (SUMI) as well as the acceptance test. We firstly showed that more than 74% of participants suffered from lack of critical thinking. Moreover, the participants indicated that they use several critical thinking skills during information seeking process, which shows there are relationships between critical thinking skills and the information seeking processes. According to the relationships between critical thinking skills and the information seeking processes, we designed a prototype for cultivating of critical thinking on the basis of fog learning. The results of the prototype evaluation emphasized on its positive role to foster critical thinking.

J	Blom, N; Bogaers, A				Blom, Nicolaas; Bogaers, Alfred			Using Linkography to investigate students' thinking and information use during a STEM task	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN EDUCATION			English	Article						Design cognition; Information sources; Linkography; STEM knowledge; Technology education	DESIGN PROCESS; COGNITION; CREATIVITY; MODEL	One of the characteristics of the twenty-first century is the increase in the information sources available to designers to make their design decisions. However, current verbal protocol analysis methods and theoretical frameworks do not explain how internal and external information sources contribute to novice designers' moment-to-moment thought processes. The purpose of this paper is to examine the use of Linkography, a protocol analysis method, to investigate the nature of novice designers' thought processes. We also introduce the use of coloured archiographs, as a complimentary tool, to analyse how novice designers use information sources during the early phases of the design process. In order to discuss and illustrate the use of these analysis methods, we report on a case study in which a group of Grade 8 participants completed a design task requiring them to design a heat retaining food container for street food vendors at a taxi depot. The findings of this study suggests that Linkography, in combination with coloured archiographs, is a novel method in technology education to analyse and visually represent how students think while they are designing.

An integrated, generic approach to pattern mining: data mining template library	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Frequent pattern mining; Itemset mining; Sequence mining; Tree mining; Graph mining; Generic programming	EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; FREQUENT; TREES	Frequent pattern mining (FPM) is an important data mining paradigm to extract informative patterns like itemsets, sequences, trees, and graphs. However, no practical framework for integrating the FPM tasks has been attempted. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the Data Mining Template Library (DMTL) for FPM. DMTL utilizes a generic data mining approach, where all aspects of mining are controlled via a set of properties. It uses a novel pattern property hierarchy to define and mine different pattern types. This property hierarchy can be thought of as a systematic characterization of the pattern space, i.e., a meta-pattern specification that allows the analyst to specify new pattern types, by extending this hierarchy. Furthermore, in DMTL all aspects of mining are controlled by a set of different mining properties. For example, the kind of mining approach to use, the kind of data types and formats to mine over, the kind of back-end storage manager to use, are all specified as a list of properties. This provides tremendous flexibility to customize the toolkit for various applications. Flexibility of the toolkit is exemplified by the ease with which support for a new pattern can be added. Experiments on synthetic and public dataset are conducted to demonstrate the scalability provided by the persistent back-end in the library. DMTL been publicly released as open-source software (http://dmtl.sourceforge.net/), and has been downloaded by numerous researchers from all over the world.

J	Cheng, L; Fang, GG; Zhang, XX; Lv, YX; Liu, LX				Cheng, Li; Fang, Gege; Zhang, Xiaoxue; Lv, Yuxiang; Liu, Lingxuan			Impact of social media use on critical thinking ability of university students	LIBRARY HI TECH			English	Article; Early Access						Critical thinking ability; University students; Social media usage; Social media dependence; Digital gap	ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE; WEB 2.0; DIGITAL DIVIDE; FACEBOOK; USAGE; SATISFACTION; DISPOSITION; VALIDATION; MODERATION; LIBRARY	Purpose This research aims to discover the relationship between social media usage (SMU) and the critical thinking ability (CTA) of university students, and to answer the question that whether social media dependence (SMD) affects the development of CTA, and thus providing a reference for the social media access strategy of academic libraries from the perspective of media information literacy. Design/methodology/approach The research data were collected via 300 valid questionnaires whose respondents are students from three universities in China. Multistage stratified cluster sampling method was used to select the respondents, which guarantees statistical representativeness. A pre-test was conducted to ensure the validity of the questionnaire. Findings It is shown that the total score of CTA and the six sub-dimensions are significantly positively correlated with SMU, but strongly negatively correlated with SMD. Based on the mediating effect testing, it is discovered that the degree of SMD can affect the promoting relations between the usage intensity of social media (UISM) and CTA. Clearly, SMU is a double-edged sword. While it narrows the digital gap in terms of accessibility, it widens the digital gap in terms of usage. Originality/value The differences in SMU have a significant impact on the development of CTA of university students. This inspires us to consider the ability of "using social media in a balanced way" as an important evaluation and training direction when inquiring media literacy. As social media is becoming a critical channel in cultivating individual's thinking skills, it is highly suggested that the amount of time spent on reading fragmented information on the internet should be controlled.

In this study, two visual and interactive pedagogies in information technology are used to train non-technical students and evaluate the performance and feedback of students in a programming course in the Department of Beauty Science. Computational thinking was integrated into the design and application of the programming subject. At the end of the semester, data were collected from 40 sophomore students in the Department of Beauty Science who answered the technology acceptance model (TAM) questionnaire and Learning Satisfactory Questionnaire after the training. An analysis was conducted using basic statistical and correlation methods, and the items demonstrated good reliability for Scratch and Tableau. The mean of 14 items in the TAM questionnaire was above 3.5 for Scratch, and that of four items was lower than 3.5 for Tableau. The mean of all the items was above 4.40 for the Learning Satisfactory Questionnaire. In the correlation analysis, the variables of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were positively related to the attitude and behavior in Scratch and Tableau. The use of visual and interactive programming pedagogies enhanced the interest of novice and non-technical students in learning technology. The learners were satisfied with the interactive pedagogies on computational and spatial intelligence.

The design thinking (DT) is a human-centered methodology leads to creativity and innovation. The agile applications development such as extreme programming (XP) as a rapid application development approach tends to focus on perfecting functionality requirement and technical implementation. However, it causes significant challenges to building software/applications to meet the needs of end-user. This study integrates DT practices into XP methodology to improve the quality of software product for the end-users and enable businesses to achieve creativity and innovation. The proposed integrated DT@XP framework presents the various DT practices (empathy, define, persona, DT user stories) are adapted into XP exploration phase, prototyping and usability evaluation into XP planning phase. Our work demonstrates the applicability of DT concepts to analyze customer/user involvement in XP projects.

J	Vilar, P; Zumer, M				Vilar, Polona; Zumer, Maja			Perceptions and importance of user friendliness of IR systems according to users' individual characteristics and academic discipline	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							WEB SEARCH STRATEGIES; INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL INTERACTION; PRELIMINARY NORMS; SCIENTISTS; INTERFACES; SEEKING; STYLE; EXPLORATION; PATTERNS; THINKING	This article presents one part of a wider study, performed at the Department of library and information science and book studies (LIS & BS) at the University of Ljubljana (UL). The study investigated the perceptions of user friendliness of information-retrieval systems (IRS) and the role of individual characteristics of users in these perceptions. Based on an expert study, a user study with 61 postgraduate students of the UL was performed. Three interfaces of e-journals were studied: Science Direct, Proquest Direct, and Ebsco Host. Questionnaires and observations were used for data collection. The users' perceptions of user friendliness and of importance of auxiliary functions were investigated. Also, the connections between these perceptions and the users' individual characteristics were identified. Three sets of individual characteristics were included: approaches to studying, thinking styles, and hemisphere leanings. In connection with the dimensions of individual characteristics, very different perceptions of user friendliness were expressed. Some dimensions of individual characteristics were also found to be connected to the users' academic areas. It is shown that participants from different academic areas have different requirements and perceptions of user friendliness. The results of the study are relevant for the design of the user interfaces of disciplinary IR systems. They also have implications for other areas, for example, user education and training.

This way of thinking has important implications in computer sciences as well as in almost every other field. Therefore, we contend that CT should be taught in elementary schools and included in every university's educational curriculum. Several studies that measure the impact of teaching programming, analytical thinking, and CT have been conducted. In this review, we analyze and discuss findings from these studies and highlight the importance of learning programming with a focus on the development of CT skills at a young age. We also describe the tools that are available to improve the teaching of CT and provide a state-of-the-art overview of how programming is being taught at schools and universities in Colombia and around the world.

However, the design of the educational robotic arm kit and the study on the effect of robotic arms on students' thinking literacy remain to be completed. In this paper, iArm, a 6-DOF robotic arm consisting of a drive chassis, an arm body, and end tools, is presented. Its auxiliary modules, including the vision module and conveyor belt, and the curriculum targeting students' computational thinking are also developed to refine the current educational robotic arm kit. Furthermore, to explore the effectiveness of the iArm kit, thirteen high school students participated in the semester-long curriculum, completed assigned projects, and filled out the pre-test and post-test scales. By formative and summative evaluation, the result shows that the iArm kit effectively enhanced students' computational thinking.

An active, low-entry-level community offering ready-to-use libraries for a broad variety of devices assists in the development of quite sophisticated projects. However, the flipside of the coin is represented by the current research findings, which reveal that students' interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects has declined across Europe, as manifested in difficulties when approaching scientific topics and dealing with problems and phenomena studied from a multidisciplinary perspective. Consequently, a significant percentage of youths are at risk of social exclusion due to the direct relationship between low academic achievements and school dropout. Moreover, learners lack guidance in applied and life-context skills, such as creative thinking, problem solving, and collaboration, which highlights the need to introduce innovative pedagogical approaches. In this context, the design thinking (DT) methodology was proposed to tackle the problem. Originating in the development of psychological studies on creativity in the 1950s within the educational context, DT is known to foster creative thinking, help develop empathy, promote action-oriented actions, improve meta-cognitive awareness, contribute to problem-solving skills, and enhance students' imagination. The last point supports the students' development of critical thinking, social inclusion, teamwork skills, and academic performance. Thus, this paper introduces a methodological framework combining DT with ER classes. First, to approach the problem, the teachers' survey data were collected and analysed to reveal the respondents' level of integration of the DT methodology into current school curricula. Then, the work focused on the application of this framework in a learning experience by addressing the weakest points established and their elaboration through the combined ER and DT classes in the context of secondary schools.

Some researchers have suggested that supporting children's strategies for book selection is crucial to encouraging children to engage with books, indicating that improving these strategies might increase the amount of reading they do. In response, this study explores how elementary-school children select books for recreational reading using a digital library. The work extends traditional models of relevance assessment with reader-response theory, employing the concept of "aesthetic relevance": the potential of a document to provide a suitable reading experience. Individuals define aesthetic relevance in personal terms and apply it as they assess documents, much as they do in traditional relevance assessment. This study identified a total of 46 factors organized along seven dimensions that influence children's assessment of the aesthetic relevance of books during selection. The analysis yielded differences in the prevalence of the aesthetic-relevance factors that children mention at various stages of book selection. In addition, the children exhibited differences by age and subtle differences by gender in the frequency of mention of various aesthetic-relevance factors. Recommendations drawn from the findings are offered to improve systems design and literacy education in order to enhance children's access to books and to promote recreational reading.

New technologies and innovations have an essential role in ensuring the well-being of the new generation. By adopting Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, it is possible to improve autonomy, security, and quality of life. However, designing IoT solutions for Home Care and older users brings new challenges to the Human-Computer Interaction field. Older users are heterogeneous and critical users of technology and interactive solutions. In this context, it is necessary to promote the participation of older users in the design process aiming at considering their specificities, intentions of use, and individual preferences and necessities. We propose a co-design method based on Design Thinking and Personas. Our research contributes to methods and a case study assessment regarding IoT-based Home Care solutions' co-design. The proposed approach considers older users' wishes and needs in an iterative, creative, and participatory way. We tested the proposed method in a case study with nine older adults. Results indicate the effectiveness and difficulties of involving older users in the design process. Our results contribute to a better understanding of how to carry out participatory activities with older adults in the context of Home Care.

In order to promote the development of critical thinking, nurse educators need to keep the teaching/learning process captivating and interesting using active learning environments. These can be implemented by using modern information and communication technologies that are simple, fun, and time and cost effective. Objectives: The goal of our study was to design and test an approach, which allows individual and fast acquisition of critical thinking skills with the use of information and communication technology. Design: A combination of qualitative and quantitative research design was implemented. The study consisted of a quasi-experiment (phases 1-3): (1) pre-test discussion board, (2) use of e-contents based on the presented approach, and (3) post-test discussion board. The participants' opinion about the presented approach was identified in phase 4. Settings: The study was performed in May 2012 during the course "Ethics and Philosophy in Nursing" at the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Primorska, Slovenia. Participants: Forty first-year undergraduate nursing students. Methods: Qualitative analysis of the discussion boards (phases 1,3) and an anonymous survey with open- and closed-ended questions (phase 4). Results: Qualitative analysis of the discussion boards showed a significant (p < 0.001) improvement in the percentage of posts (12.2%) for which the opinions and conclusions of the participants were justified with valid arguments. The survey results indicated that participants perceived the e-contents based on the presented approach as useful, and that they improved their critical thinking skills. Conclusions: Repeated confirmation of the validity of the presented approach through methodological triangulation represents a strong indication that the presented approach is a valuable tool to develop nursing students' critical thinking skills.

Design thinking can facilitate the innovative resolution of complex problems. The design thinking literature and most maker teaching modes are limited in their promotion of learning and ability development in various dimensions. Learners have stereotypes about some professions; interventions can help change these stereotypes. This research used quantitative and qualitative analyses to determine the impacts of the design thinking-maker education intervention on primary school students to prove its effectiveness in improving the learners' academic level and in developing their creative tendencies, and whether the design thinking-maker education intervention can help change the learners' stereotypes of engineers. Herein, 136 Year 4 students took a course called Movement of Objects. Traditional instruction and a design thinking-maker education intervention were applied to the control and experimental groups (n = 68 each), respectively. All students underwent an academic pretest and posttest. Stereotypes of engineers were examined through the Draw-an-Engineer Test (DAET). Creative tendencies were investigated through a pretest and posttest questionnaire. Interviews were conducted to obtain course feedback and information on the participants' perceptions of engineers. The significant between-group difference in preexisting knowledge disappeared on the posttest, and the experimental group exhibited a more significant improvement in their academic level (p < 0.01) than did the control group (p < 0.05). Regarding creative tendencies, significant pretest-posttest differences in adventure, curiosity, imagination, and the total score were observed in the experimental group. On the posttest of the DAET, the control group depicted significantly less facial hair but significantly more helmets and symbols of research and knowledge, whereas the experimental group depicted significantly less facial hair but significantly more helmets, symbols, and relevant captions. The design thinking-maker education intervention improved the learners' academic performance, developed their creative tendencies, and changed their stereotypes of engineers.

J	Beyer, C; Thomson, JS				Beyer, Charlotte; Thomson, J. Scott			Promoting health literacy within a graduate-level nutrition curriculum	REFERENCE SERVICES REVIEW			English	Article						Information literacy; Library instruction; Health literacy; Consumer health; Graduate nutrition education; Online learning	OVERESTIMATION; STUDENTS	Purpose - This paper describes how two academic health science librarians exposed graduate students to health literacy concepts in a graduate-level nutrition course. This paper aims to present an easy method for librarians to expose students in the health professions to concepts of health literacy. Design/methodology/approach - The Information and Health Literacy course is an online course co-taught by nutrition faculty and librarians at Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science. The librarian-led one-week health literacy module begins with readings that define health literacy and continues with two online discussion board activities. One activity is identifying an example of low health literacy in their personal or professional lives, and the other is using criteria from the readings in their analysis of a consumer health website. Findings - Students often comment that prior to taking this course, they had not considered how patients might think about and understand their own health care, but they will now take it into account going forward. Many students also felt that the assignment made them view Web resources for patients differently and with a more critical eye. Originality/value - Those in allied health professions like registered dietitians often have direct contact with patients and have the ability to make a significant impact. If students are exposed to health literacy concepts through online activities within the curriculum, they may be more aware of this important concept when working with patients in the future.

Design Thinking in Health Care	PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE			English	Review							USER-CENTERED DESIGN; EXPOSURE THERAPY; SELF-MANAGEMENT; DISEASE RISK; INTERVENTION; SYSTEM; INFORMATION; USABILITY; KNOWLEDGE; PROTOCOL	Introduction Applying Design Thinking to health care could enhance innovation, efficiency, and effectiveness by increasing focus on patient and provider needs. The objective of this review is to determine how Design Thinking has been used in health care and whether it is effective. Methods We searched online databases (PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PyscINFO) for articles published through March 31, 2017, using the terms "health," "health care," or "healthcare"; and "Design Thinking," "design science," "design approach," "user centered design," or "human centered design." Studies were included if they were written in English, were published in a peer-reviewed journal, provided outcome data on a health-related intervention, and used Design Thinking in intervention development, implementation, or both. Data were collected on target users, health conditions, intervention, Design Thinking approach, study design or sample, and health outcomes. Studies were categorized as being successful (all outcomes improved), having mixed success (at least one outcome improved), or being not successful (no outcomes improved). Results Twenty-four studies using Design Thinking were included across 19 physical health conditions, 2 mental health conditions, and 3 systems processes. Twelve were successful, 11 reported mixed success, and one was not successful. All 4 studies comparing Design Thinking interventions to traditional interventions showed greater satisfaction, usability, and effectiveness. Conclusion Design Thinking is being used in varied health care settings and conditions, although application varies. Design Thinking may result in usable, acceptable, and effective interventions, although there are methodological and quality limitations. More research is needed, including studies to isolate critical components of Design Thinking and compare Design Thinking-based interventions with traditionally developed interventions.

The experiment consisted of participants using the Scratch Program and Creative Computing Guidebook, both developed by the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) media laboratory, for a total of 15 hours. An experimental group and a control group were formed and consisted of fourth to sixth graders. DBL was applied to the experimental group, while a traditional, direct method of teaching was applied to the control group. The experiment was designed to examine several aspects of learning: self-efficacy, self-interest, and self-CT. Moreover, we compared changes in students' perceptions of computers and analysed differences in students' responses between the two groups according to each of the steps of DBL. Then, we verified the effects of DBL by examining the progress of each group and the differences between the two groups. At the end of the experiment, we found that both groups showed enhanced self-efficacy, self-interest, and self-CT. However, the experimental group had a greater number of significant positive changes than the control group did in all areas (p < .01). In conclusion, the findings presented herein demonstrated that applying DBL is more effective for improving CT than traditional methodologies are.

J	Haupt, G				Haupt, Grietjie			Learning from experts: fostering extended thinking in the early phases of the design process	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN EDUCATION			English	Article						Design cognition; Expert; Extended cognition; Early phases; Information processes; Embodiment	CREATIVITY; COGNITION	Empirical evidence on the way in which expert designers from different domains cognitively connect their internal processes with external resources is presented in the context of an extended cognition model. The article focuses briefly on the main trends in the extended design cognition theory and in particular on recent trends in information processing and embodiment theory. The aim of the paper is to reflect on the implications of an understanding of expert design cognition as an extended system, which can account for complexity and non-linearity in design thinking and problem-solving, for technology and design education. This is achieved by showing the relevance of the cross-correlations and the dynamics involved at the intersection of cognitive phases, intention-driven decision making and embodiment principles of experts for novice education in technology and design. It is argued that twentieth century one-sided approaches to design education no longer adequately serve the needs of the twenty first century. It is further argued that a combined information-processing + embodiment approach may be the answer. The article presents salient results of a case study using think-aloud-protocol studies in a quasi-experimental format that was used as it has proven to be a central instrument yielding scientific data in the cognitive science paradigm. Results suggested extended design environments may be particularly well-suited to the mediation of design thinking. Finally, based on these results, the article examines how educators can exploit the combined approach to advance the making of connections between the inner and outer world in design education.

J	Wang, GT				Wang, Gongtai			Digital reframing: The design thinking of redesigning traditional products into innovative digital products	JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						case study; design thinking; digital innovation; reframing	RADICAL INNOVATION; SCIENCE RESEARCH; INFORMATION; TECHNOLOGY; RECOMBINATION; INSTITUTIONS; ARCHITECTURE; METHODOLOGY; REPERTOIRE; CATEGORIES	The redesign of traditional products into innovative digital products is a profound form of digital innovation. It is imperative for both digitally native and traditional firms to understand and effectively manage this form of digital innovation to survive and thrive amid expected disruptions when traditional products are driven out of business by digital products. Current insights into this form of digital innovation are limited, as previous research has focused on the design of innovative digital technologies. However, if we break everyday digital products down, we often find centuries-old physical products and digital technologies that have existed for years, if not decades. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of digital innovation is needed to attend to how the digital and the physical are combined, and how such a combination makes digital products innovative even when it reuses existing digital technologies. To this end, this study addresses the research question, "How does the reuse of digital technologies enable the redesign of a traditional product into an innovative digital product?" Adopting the "design thinking as reframing" perspective, we conducted a grounded theory study of the design thinking acted out by the doing of the design of an innovative digital theatre. This study inductively develops a theory explaining the design thinking of redesigning a traditional product into an innovative digital product as a digital reframing process, where designers take the frames of digital technologies and rethink existing products (frame taking), merge the frames into the product under design (frame merging), and propose a new frame to interpret the resultant product (frame giving). Our study has important implications for both research and practice.

It also seems to be an extremely interesting and important field in both management practice and literature. Recently, the areas that the different functions (like accounting, marketing, production and information systems) of firm and strategic thinking have in common have been lively discussed. In this paper, the applicability of information systems thinking to strategic thinking is outlined. For that purpose, three modes of strategy-making are explicated: strategy-making as management process, as game-playing and as leadership. In each of these three modes, the strategy design phase and especially the essentials of its knowledge creation function are presented. Finally, on the basis of this analysis, the information systems approach and strategic thinking are compared and the areas of mutual cooperation as well as those devoid of cooperation are revealed.

Learner modeling for adaptive scaffolding in a Computational Thinking-based science learning environment	USER MODELING AND USER-ADAPTED INTERACTION			English	Article						Open ended learning environments; Modeling and simulation; Learning by modeling; Computational Thinking; Science education; Learner modeling; Adaptive scaffolding	SEMANTIC WEB; STUDENTS; FEEDBACK; METACOGNITION; EVOLUTION; EDUCATION; DESIGN; TUTORS; STATE; K-12	Learner modeling has been used in computer-based learning environments to model learners' domain knowledge, cognitive skills, and interests, and customize their experiences in the environment based on this information. In this paper, we develop a learner modeling and adaptive scaffolding framework for Computational Thinking using Simulation and Modeling (CTSiM)-an open ended learning environment that supports synergistic learning of science and Computational Thinking (CT) for middle school students. In CTSiM, students have the freedom to choose and coordinate use of the different tools provided in the environment, as they build and test their models. However, the open-ended nature of the environment makes it hard to interpret the intent of students' actions, and to provide useful feedback and hints that improves student understanding and helps them achieve their learning goals. To address this challenge, we define an extended learner modeling scheme that uses (1) a hierarchical task model for the CTSiM environment, (2) a set of strategies that support effective learning and model building, and (3) effectiveness and coherence measures that help us evaluate student's proficiency in the different tasks and strategies. We use this scheme to dynamically scaffold learners when they are deficient in performing their tasks, or they demonstrate suboptimal use of strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a classroom study where one group of 6th grade students received scaffolding and the other did not. We found that students who received scaffolding built more accurate models, used modeling strategies effectively, adopted more useful modeling behaviors, showed a better understanding of important science and CT concepts, and transferred their modeling skills better to new scenarios.

J	Frisk, JE; Bannister, F				Frisk, Jane Elisabeth; Bannister, Frank			Applying design thinking to the decision-making process: a field study in Swedish local authorities	MANAGEMENT DECISION			English	Article						Innovation; Local government; Decision-making; Design thinking; Complex decisions	FRAMEWORK; FUTURE	Purpose This study aims to examine the application of design thinking to complex decision-making processes in local government and to link the design thinking to the theoretical work of leading thinkers in decision-making. Design/methodology/approach This study uses multiple case studies, including non-participant observation, group discussions, semi-structured interviews, presentations and questionnaires. Findings For complex decisions, design thinking can contribute to more effective decision-making by expanding the range of solutions considered, people consulted and involved, sources of data/information and decision tools as well as in achieving buy-in to the eventual decision. Research limitations/implications The principal limitations include that this is one study in one country and in the public sector. There were some practical problems with external factors disrupting two of the cases, but these do not affect the findings. The principal implication is that by adopting a design thinking approach to complex decision-making, the quality of decision-making and decisions can be significantly improved. Practical implications When it comes to complex decisions, organisations can improve the quality of both their decision-making processes and their decisions by adopting and implementing ideas and insights from design thinking. Social implications For local authorities, a design approach can enhance the quality of the services provided by local authorities to citizens in particular in better meeting the needs of users and other stakeholders and in opening up better lines of communications between officials and citizens. Originality/value This research was based on an initiative in Swedish local government and its first implementation in practice. The authors are not aware of any similar study done elsewhere.

J	Hevner, A; Gregor, S				Hevner, Alan; Gregor, Shirley			Envisioning entrepreneurship and digital innovation through a design science research lens: A matrix approach	INFORMATION & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Digital innovation; Entrepreneurship; Design science research; Knowledge; Information technology; Entrepreneurship strategies; Sociotechnical systems	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; FRONT-END; TECHNOLOGY; ORGANIZATIONS; CAPABILITIES; EFFECTUATION; DISCIPLINE; CREATIVITY; DYNAMICS; LESSONS	Design Science Research (DSR) in the information systems (IS) field is, at its essence, about Digital Innovation (DI). Innovative sociotechnical design artifacts involve digital information technologies (IT) being used in ways that result in profound disruptions to traditional ways of doing business and to widespread societal changes. The pervasiveness of DI means that the individuals involved in bringing it about have diverse backgrounds, including application specialists, software engineers, data scientists, business managers, economists, venture capitalists, various user groups, and entrepreneurial leaders. This range of backgrounds means that DI, much more than traditional innovation, leads to varied perspectives on the methods and tools to be used in the development of effective and evolvable complex systems incorporating digital innovations. In this paper we present a new matrix approach to DI based on DSR, entrepreneurship, and innovation theories. Clear strategic guidance allows these multiple stakeholders to make sense of the diverse landscape and to understand when and how different entrepreneurial strategies for innovation can best be applied. We define the combined DSR and DI matrix approach in terms of four strategies: invention; advancement; exaptation; and exploitation and their associated DI practices. The research contribution is a novel DSR-DI matrix process model. This model extends entrepreneurship theory as it enriches effectuation thinking with more detailed process guidance for ambidextrous entrepreneurship and it enriches DSR models for DI by showing more explicitly the different pathways corresponding to different quadrants in the knowledge-innovation matrix.

Machine-Guided Design of Oxidation-Resistant Superconductors for Quantum Information Applications	INORGANICS			English	Article						superconductivity; materials design; quantum science		Decoherence in superconducting qubits has long been attributed to two-level systems arising from the surfaces and interfaces present in real devices. A recent significant step in reducing decoherence was the replacement of superconducting niobium by superconducting tantalum, resulting in a tripling of transmon qubit lifetimes (T-1). The identity, thickness, and quality of the native surface oxide, is thought to play a major role, as tantalum only has one oxide whereas niobium has several. Here we report the development of a thermodynamic metric to rank materials based on their potential to form a well-defined, thin, surface oxide. We first computed this metric for known binary and ternary metal alloys using data available from the Materials Project and experimentally validated the strengths and limits of this metric through the preparation and controlled oxidation of eight known metal alloys. Then we trained a convolutional neural network to predict the value of this metric from atomic composition and atomic properties. This allowed us to compute the metric for materials that are not present in the Materials Project, including a large selection of known superconductors, and, when combined with T-c, allowed us to identify new candidate superconductors for quantum information science and engineering (QISE) applications. We tested the oxidation resistance of a pair of these predictions experimentally. Our results are expected to lay the foundation for the tailored and rapid selection of improved superconductors for QISE.

The Complex Network Electronic Knowledge Translation Research model (CoNEKTR) brings together complexity science, design thinking, social learning theories, systems thinking and eHealth technologies together to support a sustained engagement strategy for social innovation support and enhancing knowledge integration. Methods The CoNEKTR model adapts elements of other face-to-face social organizing methods and combines it with social media and electronic networking tools to create a strategy for idea generation, refinement and social action. Drawing on complexity science, a series of networking and dialogue-enhancing activities are employed to bring diverse groups together, facilitate dialogue and create networks of networks. Results Ten steps and five core processes informed by complexity science have been developed through this model. Concepts such as emergence, attractors and feedback play an important role in facilitating networking among participants in the model. Conclusions Using a constrained, focused approach informed by complexity science and using information technology, the CoNEKTR model holds promise as a means to enhance system capacity for knowledge generation, learning and action while working within the limitations faced by busy health professionals.

Powerful telecommunications conglomerates are being formed to provide entertainment directly to the home, thus leading to the creation of a virtual cyberworld. A future journey through this new dimension, will allow one to enter virtual constructions that are the equivalent of the cinemas, theatres, entertainment parks, libraries and news organisations present in our physical world. We should consider whether there will be a similar proliferation of choices for the cybercitizen to enter schools, colleges and campuses in that cyberworld. The time to think about creating a virtual cybercampus is now. The present day media focus on the information superhighway unduly stresses the importance of the vehicles that will travel on this digital highway. The information superhighway is just a main arterial trunk for the passage of digital, high bandwidth data packages. As educators, we should look beyond the highway to the virtual destinations and focus on the needs of the individual user in search of knowledge at any time, in any place, and of any age. In these past seven years, my work in medical education at university level, and now with secondary and primary school education, into this new dimension has looked to the future with a virtual cybercampus for individualised learning. New techniques of teaching and communication can be integrated with new fundamentals of learning in order to best use this technological gift. The result will be to gain a quantum leap for human learning, both in terms of availability or access to knowledge, and also in terms of stimulation for the search and the wonder of knowledge of the natural world.

J	Yin, YH; Xie, JY; Xu, LD; Chen, H				Yin, Yue H.; Xie, Jin Y.; Xu, Li Da; Chen, Hao			Imaginal Thinking-Based Human-Machine Design Methodology for the Configuration of Reconfigurable Machine Tools	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Configuration design; enterprise systems; human-machine interface; imaginal thinking; industrial informatics		Reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs) has emerged as an advanced system for applying Enterprise Systems (ES) in manufacturing enterprises to dynamically adapt to the changing market. Although it has been recognized that human-machine interaction plays a significant role in configuration design, especially for reconfigurable machines tools (RMTs), for the core of RMS, there are no platforms available for the harmonious interaction between human and computer, mainly because of the limitation of traditional artificial intelligence frame. In this paper, we present a human-machine design methodology for the configuration of RMTs based on imaginal thinking, a thinking style described as forming and comparison of images, which is radically different from traditional logical and intuitive thinking. The knowledge and experience that are highly relevant to mechanical design and the related information in logical deduction are organized as high dimensional images. By imitating human imaginal thinking, computer employs Lie subgroup or submanifold and Quotient kinematics to generate all possible configurations in the form of images, while humans make judgments and complete the optimization process through the imaginal human-machine interface. Both human's decision-making ability based on knowledge and experience and computer's high-speed logical computation are exploited to a full extent. This novel design methodology has illustrated its effectiveness by an example concerning the design of a pipe-cutting RMT.

Objective: To understand how individuals across 3 generations (young, middle-aged, and older) think about the design and use of collaborative health and wellness management technologies and what roles these could take in their lives. Methods: Face-to-face semistructured interviews, paper prototype systems, and video skits were used to assess how individuals from 3 age cohorts (young: 18-25 years; middle-aged: 35-50 years; and older: >= 65 years) conceptualize the role that health and wellness computing could take in their lives. Results: A total of 21 participants in the 3 age cohorts took part (young: n=7; middle-aged: n=7; and older: n=7). Young adults expected to be able to actively manage the presentation of their health-related information. Middle-aged adults had more nuanced expectations that reflect their engagement with work and other life activities. Older adults questioned the sharing of health information with a larger audience, although they saw the value in 1-way sharing between family members or providing aggregated information. Conclusions: Our findings inform our suggestions for improving the design of future collaborative health and wellness applications that target specific age groups. We recommend that collaborative ICT health applications targeting young adults should integrate with existing social networking sites, whereas those targeting middle-aged and older adults should support small social networks that rely on intimate personal relationships. Systems that target middle-aged adults should support episodic needs, such as time-sensitive, perhaps intermittent, goal setting. They should also have a low barrier to entry, allowing individuals who do not normally engage with the Internet to participate with the application for the specific purposes of health engagement. Collaborative ICT health applications targeting older adults should allow discreet 1-way sharing, and also support sharing of information in aggregate with others' data. These systems should also provide mechanisms to preselect recipients of different kinds of data, or to easily direct specific information to individuals in real time.

J	Henshaw, JL				Henshaw, J. L.			Systems Thinking for Systems Making: Joining Systems of Thought and Action	SYSTEMIC PRACTICE AND ACTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Systems thinking; Systems making; Rosen model; Action research; Natural systems thinking; Pattern language; Organizational change; Narrative arcs	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS	A common use of systems thinking (ST) is for guiding our practices of systems making (SM). One style of ST for SM centers on making designs with deterministic rules, as in the hard sciences, for guiding engineered applications. Another style mimics natural development, with a process by stepwise learning and improvisation to produce evolving designs; examples including architectural design, scientific research, and the practice of action research (AR). All these use exploratory pathfinding to search for better ways to work with reality, and this is the main subject of the paper. Both deterministic and adaptive ST for SM are widely found in differing roles, each having capabilities the other lacks. I start with simple models, such as step-wise improvisation for adapting recipes when making dinner. Another example is Robert Rosen's model for how scientific and other cultures learn to work with nature, by turning attention back and forth between nature and theory for creating their cultural language. A review of the modern history of the systems sciences, as practices of ST for SM, then further broadens the view and context. That leads to introducing a new paradigm of natural systems thinking (NST), using commitments to critical awareness, emancipation, and methodological pluralism for working with natural systems.

It suggests that a combined BIM model in design can be regarded as an ideal or special object, as suggested by Ilyenkov in his theory of the ideal. The concepts of intermediary object and artefact help in analysing the cycles of construction of such an object in design. BIM models as modifiable digital artefacts contribute to their capability of functioning as tools of individual design work and collaboration as well as means of objectifying the outcomes of design cycles into intermediary objects. We argue that the uses of combined BIM models give birth to a new modality of spatial thought, perception and collaborative problem solving in construction design.

J	Gregor, S; Jones, D				Gregor, Shirley; Jones, David			The anatomy of a design theory	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						design theory; design science; constructive research; philosophy of science; information systems; information technology; artifacts; theory structure	INFORMATION; SYSTEMS; SCIENCE	Design work and design knowledge in Information Systems ( IS) is important for both research and practice. Yet there has been comparatively little critical attention paid to the problem of specifying design theory so that it can be communicated, justified, and developed cumulatively. In this essay we focus on the structural components or anatomy of design theories in IS as a special class of theory. In doing so, we aim to extend the work of Walls, Widemeyer and El Sawy ( 1992) on the specification of information systems design theories (ISDT), drawing on other streams of thought on design research and theory to provide a basis for a more systematic and useable formulation of these theories. We identify eight separate components of design theories: ( 1) purpose and scope, ( 2) constructs, ( 3) principles of form and function, ( 4) artifact mutability, ( 5) testable propositions, ( 6) justificatory knowledge ( kernel theories), ( 7) principles of implementation, and ( 8) an expository instantiation. This specification includes components missing in the Walls et al. adaptation of Dubin ( 1978) and Simon ( 1969) and also addresses explicitly problems associated with the role of instantiations and the specification of design theories for methodologies and interventions as well as for products and applications. The essay is significant as the unambiguous establishment of design knowledge as theory gives a sounder base for arguments for the rigor and legitimacy of IS as an applied discipline and for its continuing progress. A craft can proceed with the copying of one example of a design artifact by one artisan after another. A discipline cannot.

J	Solomon, P				Solomon, P			Discovering information behavior in sense making .2. The social	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article								This article, the second of three, used the methods of ethnography of communication to explore the social elements of information behavior in sense making of participants in the annual work planning of a unit of a public agency. In particular, this article focuses on the role of information in the sense making that took place from the point of view of the organization and other social communication aspects of work life. The organizational sense-making analysis considers the instantiation of various properties relating to the organization's strategies for survival (identity), history(retrospect), and relations with its environment (extraction of cues). Taken together, the instantiation of these properties structures and supports what, where, when, why, and how information behaviors are employed in sense making. Also considered is the social role of various communicative events (e.g., meetings, conversations, written messages) in the sense making of the parties to the work-planning task. Communicative events also provide situations for and constraints on the role of information behavior in sense making. A fundamental finding is that the participants in the work-planning process did not think of information or actions to collect, process, or use information as something separate from the task or problem at hand. Attention to this fact suggests that information systems that exist to support tasks in social settings need to be integrated into organizational or institutional designs. Otherwise, such systems are likely to exist, consume resources, and divert attention away from the basic issues, problems, and sense making of tasks and situations.

The framework will help organizations to best meet user/customer needs with minimum waste and time and enables businesses to achieve efficiency compared with island and traditional sequential approaches. The proposed framework can also provide insights to help organizations to avoid common failures when deploying digital transformation initiatives. The paper follows the design science research (DSR) and the information systems design science research (ISDSR) methodologies to develop the IDTSF model and a practical design artifact. The main problems were the initiation, execution, and governance challenges associated with digital transformation. After identifying the problems and the objectives, a relevant IDTSF model was synthesized and tested as a design artifact. The results of the test of the proposed artifact showed its effectiveness and efficiency in facilitating the components of the model in creating a cohesive framework.

It provides a central source of inspiration for new ideas and determines the pathways available for creative problem solving. Notwithstanding its indisputable role, knowledge may also compromise creativity. The human mind is prone to reproduce what it is used to, and the provision of explicit knowledge constitutes a potential inhibitor of imagination. Hence, IT systems supporting creative work have to support creative individuals by extending their personal knowledge while, at the same time, preventing them from merely walking down beaten tracks. In this article, grounded in theory on human cognition and literature on creativity support, we propose a design theory for IT systems that support both convergent and divergent thinking, that is, the central cognitive processes in creative work. We provide details on a prototypical implementation, discuss an illustrative case from the creative industries in order to demonstrate the design's applicability, and outline plans for an empirical evaluation of the proposed design theory.

Meanwhile, the design of complex sociotechnical systems highly relies on multidisciplinary knowledge and design methods. Despite the emergence of knowledge management techniques (ontology, expert system, text mining, etc.), designers continue to store knowledge in unstructured ways. To facilitate the integration of knowledge graph and design thinking, we introduce an integrated approach to structure design knowledge graph with the AIA design thinking, which organizes existing design knowledge through Agent (concept)-Interaction (relation)-Adaptation (concept) framework. The approach uses an optimized convolutional neural network to accomplish two tasks: building concept graph from text and stimulating design thinking information processing for complex sociotechnical system tasks. Based on our knowledge graph, the validation experiment demonstrates the advantages of promoting the designer's extension of idea space and idea quality.

The objectives are to identify the challenges faced in the communication of information and data on construction projects and determine how these barriers influence quality performance of a project. Design/methodology/approach Limitations in the literature on information seeking, coupled with the utilization of Theory of Motivated Information Management as a response led to the development of research problem statement. Through comprehensive review of literature published between the years 2005-2019, the paper first identified barriers of information communication in the industry and key performance indicators of construction quality, followed by content analyses to rank and screen out the least important variables. This paved the way for quantitative and qualitative analyses through 180 structured questionnaires and 11 expert opinion sessions that respectively led to the use of systems thinking approach to establish causality. Findings The study finds ineffective communication, unclear details, changes in contract, information delays, unpleasant relationships between stakeholders and project complexity as the most critical factors causing information complexity in a construction project. These factors cause a reduction in quality performance of a project through increased rework and decreased implementation of total quality management. Practical implications The study will assist project managers to diagnose quality-related issues in their projects, trace them back to the challenges and barriers of information communication and then make policy/strategic interventions to reduce such issues through improved information flow. Originality/value Majority of the studies in this field of work have identified the effects of ineffective information flow on overall project performance, but very few have focused specifically on the quality of construction projects.

Their almost limitless structural possibilities, as opposed to limited structural variations within molecular solvents, make ILs designer solvents. They also have been widely promoted as green solvents although their claimed relative nontoxicity has been frequently questioned. The Thinking in Structure-Activity Relationships (T-SAR) approach has proved to be an efficient method to gather relevant toxicological information of analog series of ILs. However, when data sets significantly grow in size and structural diversity, the use of computational models becomes essential. We provided such a computational solution in a previous work by introducing a reliable, predictive, simple, and chemically interpretable Classification and Regression Tree (CART) classifier enabling the prioritization of ILs with a favorable cytotoxicity profile. Even so, an efficient and exhaustive mining of SAR information goes beyond analog compound series and the applicability domain of quantitative SAR modeling. So, we decided to complement our previous findings based on the use of the CART classifier by applying the network-like similarity graph (NSG) approach to the mining of relevant structure-cytotoxicity relationship (SCR) trends. Finally, the SCR information concurrently gathered by both, quantitative (CART classifier) and qualitative (NSG) approaches was used to design a focused combinatorial library enriched with potentially safe ILs.

However, there have been mixed results about whether music, as an environmental stimulus, improves design creativity performance. Methods: Participants were 57 design major students who were randomly assigned to one of three groups, with 19 students in each group: no music, pure music, and music with intelligible semantic information (unrelated to the task) playing in the background. Each participant completed a design task (design a tool for storing painting materials), with two phases in it, one that involved idea generation (divergent thinking) and one that involved idea evaluation (convergent thinking). Performance in the two phases was rated based on six indices of creativity (fluency; flexibility; adaptability; feasibility; usefulness; novelty) and overall design creativity (ODC). Results: The results of one-way ANOVAs with Bonferroni correction showed that neither music environment had a significant influence on divergent thinking in idea generation nor convergent thinking in idea evaluation. However, both music environments had a significantly positive effect on novelty and ODC. Discussion: We discuss the implications of our current results for fostering designers' creativity performance.

The case study design, a qualitative research method, is employed in the study. The participants consist of gifted and talented students attending the Science and Arts Center. Integrated STEM activities based on the EDP were conducted over the course of ten weeks and among these activities, robotic and 3D modeling-based robot construction activities using Lego sets are addressed in the present study. The STEM activity booklet, researchers' fieldnotes, and teaching process video recordings were used as data collection tools in the study. Data that was collected was analyzed through content analysis. It was seen that gifted and talented students participating in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP make active use of critical thinking skills while providing explanations, making associations, questioning information, giving justifications, solving problems, thinking creatively, making generalizations, and attempting to convince others; as for the instances of defining problems, creating solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, the students were observed to actively use their problem-solving skills. The detailed account provided by the study on the way robotic and 3D robot modeling activities improve the computational thinking skills of gifted and talented students contributes to the required educational support and to the existing body of literature.

To do so, "searching" category of ASIS&T thesaurus was selected and ASIS&TOnto was built based on it. Design/methodology/approach - The usability examination method is used in order to compare the two semantic tools. Nine indexers were recruited as participants, who were proficient in English language, had experience in using the thesaurus and all had successfully passed the course of "information representation." They were asked to think aloud while working with the tools and to answer a semi-structured interview. The data gathering was continued until it reached its saturation point. Findings - The results of this study revealed that the definitions and scope notes represented in indexing tools such as thesauri and ontologies have an important role in improvement of indexers' understanding. On comparing the hierarchical relations, results show that converting the structure of hierarchical relationships of ASIS&T thesaurus can enhance the indexers understanding of them, and also enriching the associative relations of ASIS&T thesaurus can cause indexers to have a better understanding and evaluation of the presented concepts and relations. Originality/value - This study shares our findings on the usability of ASIS&T thesaurus as a core set of vocabulary for building a "searching" domain as a prototype ontology in the area of library and information science and provides the indexers viewpoints of the two semantic tools in this area.

J	Taylor, ML				Taylor, M. L.			Designing the future of forensic science: metis and forensic intelligence	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES			English	Article; Early Access						Forensic intelligence; FORINT; design; metis	CRIME; INFORMATION; LAW	'Design thinking' necessitates that we challenge our core beliefs to reframe our understanding and generate innovative solutions. The noun 'design' may also connote cunning. Metis (m?t?s) is such a form of thought and knowledge. Through wise application of prudence, vigilance and opportunism, it operates in unstable and uncertain environments. While the nature of crime is enduring, its character is transitory. If forensic science is to remain a valuable force-multiplier, it must co-adapt with a policing model that is orienting towards proactivity and disruption. 'Forensic intelligence (FORINT) is intelligence derived from technical and forensic information and expertise', and is the epitome of forensic science agility and a manifestation of metis in design. It is transdisciplinary, operating in different phases of the (pre-)investigative workflow, across the tactical-operational-strategic continuum. FORINT may emerge readily from a consultative/integrative forensic organization. Alternatively, its establishment may be a 'Trojan Horse' (consider Odysseus, master of metis): in design parlance this refers to an artefact that also is a vehicle for strategic change. Countering polymorphic transnational serious and organized crime requires us to be more multiple, more polyvalent, without compromise of ethics or integrity - leveraging metis in designing the future of forensic science through FORINT.

Proof of this is in the joint efforts of international organizations to achieve the 2030 SDG agenda in a complex environment. Thus, UNESCO has recognized CS as being among the initiatives that could bridge the Science, Technology, and Innovation gap as a substantial resource, given its power to bring the general public closer together. Although tech-based CS projects keep rising, there is limited knowledge about which type of projects might allow participants to develop higher-order complex thinking skills. To that end, this study describes a systematic literature review (SLR) and analysis of 49 CS projects over the last 5 years concerning the technology utilized, the level of citizen involvement, and the intended social impact. The results of the analysis evidenced: (a) broad implementation in Europe on issues of the built environment, disaster risk, and environmental and animal monitoring; (b) prevalence of helix configurations other than the triple, quadruple, and quintuple helix innovation models; (c) a focus on technological developments to improve living conditions in cities; (d) an opportunity to develop applied native technologies; (e) limited development of participants' complex thinking, when constrained to low levels of involvement; and (f) an opportunity to develop native technologies and promote a higher level of citizen participation, leading to more significant impact whilst developing complex thinking.

Thus, it is crucial to create STEM educational strategies that infuse diverse and interconnected perspectives among scientists, policymakers, and the general public. Systems thinking represents one such pedagogical approach, in which a holistic framework empowers both teachers and students to recognize how fundamental concepts taught in the classroom can be used as resourceful tools to better address complex, multicomponent modern challenges. For chemical educators, topics on technology (the "T" in STEM education) represent a particularly meaningful avenue to introduce and study the effectiveness of systems thinking, but there have been few examples reported to date. Here, we show that a molecular engineering course introduced at the University of Chicago 5 years ago ("Introduction to Emerging Technologies") provides a model course to this end, where explicitly designing in elements of systems thinking to the course could further strengthen students' understanding of the already well suited, holistic course topics. Integrating systems thinking would illuminate how tissue engineering, nanomedicine, batteries, quantum information, and meat alternatives are developed from multiple, interrelated fields as well as from basic science to a practical reality. For each technology, we outline the direct connections between the current course topics and future opportunities to incorporate systems thinking strategies, challenging students to identify the interdependence of components in a successful technology. Finally, to offer further insight for instructors interested in utilizing systems thinking, we broaden our discussion to reflect on the challenges of redesigning any STEM course to utilize systems thinking, and we present corresponding teaching strategies to overcome them.

Therefore, we proposed that board game design is a meaningful tool for engaging youth in understanding environmental issues. We reported findings from an educational board game design workshop based on real world issues for teens aged 13-17 years conducted at a large public library Makerspace. Using qualitative methods, we analysed the teens' process of making one such game, Pollutaplop, to understand its merits and argued that board game design nurtured the development of tools for inquiry. In response to the recent surge of interest in creating tools for learning about natural systems, we found that designing board games in authentic contexts engaged youth in building models as well as systems thinking. Intent gamers, including youth, might be well positioned to appreciate the complexities of both games and the contexts they are set in.

Using a Dutch case study, this article shows how a new concept for hotels - the Lifestyle Hub - was created using design thinking as methodology. The Lifestyle Hub concept provides ingredients to hotel owners as well as public policymakers to help understand how future guests may expect to make use of individually tailored hospitable facilities in destinations around the world. Moreover, design thinking allows researchers and businesses to generate highly differentiated customer-centred, experience-based business concepts, thus adding to the toolkit of futures researchers. We conclude that design thinking provides new insights for hospitality and tourism and presents a valuable alternative to current future scenarios approaches.

Design: Standard methods of information-processing and cognitive science were used to study diagnostic processes (search, perception, reasoning) of 28 novices, intermediates, and experts. Participants examined cases in breast pathology; each case had a previously established gold standard diagnosis. Videotapes correlated the actual visual data examined by participants with their verbal "think-aloud" protocols. Measurements: Investigators measured accuracy, difficulty, certainty, protocol process frequencies, error frequencies, and times to key diagnostic events for each case and subject. Analyses of variance, chi-square tests and post-hoc comparisons were performed with subject as the unit of analysis. Results: Level of expertise corresponded with differences in search, perception, and reasoning components of the tasks. Several discrete steps occur on the path to competence, including development of adequate search strategies, rapid and accurate recognition of anatomic location, acquisition of visual data interpretation skills, and transitory reliance on explicit feature identification. Conclusion: Results provide the basis for an empirical cognitive model of competence for the complex tasks of microscopic pathology diagnosis. Results will inform the development of computer-based pedagogy tools in this domain.

The Development of a Mobile Health App for Breast Cancer Self-Management Support in Taiwan: Design Thinking Approach	JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH			English	Article						breast cancer; mobile health application; self-management; design thinking	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; WOMEN; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY; NEEDS; CHEMOTHERAPY; EXPERIENCE; SURVIVORS; CHINESE	Background: Evidence has shown that breast cancer self-management support from mobile health (mHealth) apps can improve the quality of life of survivors. Although many breast cancer self-management support apps exist, few papers have documented the procedure for the development of a user-friendly app from the patient's perspective. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the information needs of Taiwanese women with breast cancer to inform the development of a self-management support mHealth app. Methods: A 5-step design thinking approach, comprising empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and test steps, was used in the focus groups and individual interviews conducted to collect information on the requirements and expectations of Taiwanese women with breast cancer with respect to the app. A thematic analysis was used to identify information needs. Results: A total of 8 major themes including treatment, physical activity, diet, emotional support, health records, social resources, experience sharing, and expert consultation were identified. Minor themes included the desire to use the app under professional supervision and a trustworthy app manager to ensure the credibility of information. Conclusions: The strengths of the design thinking approach were user-centered design and cultural sensitivity. The results retrieved from each step contributed to the development of the app and reduction of the gap between end users and developers. An mHealth app that addresses these 8 main themes can facilitate disease self-management for Taiwanese women with breast cancer.

However, the effect of ICT on the development of students' scientific higher-order thinking skills (S-HOTS) is a controversial issue in science education research. This has attracted significant attention from researchers worldwide in the field of educational technology. Purpose In this study, a novel framework for students' S-HOTS is proposed based on Marzano's new taxonomy to determine the impact of ICT on S-HOTS. And exploring the difference in the impact of ICT on S-HOTS in two different countries. Sample The data for this study were obtained from the Science Assessment and ICT Familiarity Questionnaire of the PISA 2015 survey for Finnish and Chinese students. This survey measures the differences in economic and educational levels and literacy in each country and tests the knowledge and skills necessary for life in reading, mathematics, and science for students (15 years old), through a detailed pre-testing country field study to make the results comparable across countries. Design and methods We used the Delphi methodology to determine the framework of S-HOTS and a regression analysis to analyse the effects of ICT on students' S-HOTS. Results The results demonstrate how the availability, use frequency and use time of ICT affect S-HOTS. Furthermore, we compared the results between China (9841 students) and Finland (2538 students), and these findings demonstrated that ICT use at school has a negative effect on S-HOTS, especially ICT use time in school. We also found that using an interactive whiteboard positively and significantly affects S-HOTS. Conclusion The results suggest that the effect of ICT use on S-HOTS in school depends on the ICT method combined with the learning process. Consequently, the use of ICT in schools should be viewed dialectically to promote students' S-HOTS.

J	Mentzer, N; Becker, K; Sutton, M				Mentzer, Nathan; Becker, Kurt; Sutton, Mathias			Engineering Design Thinking: High School Students' Performance and Knowledge	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						engineering design; high school; engineering education		BackgroundBecause design is recognized as a critical element of engineering thinking, it is crucial for educators to utilize the most effective methods to teach engineering problem solving. Results from this study of students' thinking process may shape future teaching methods. PurposeThis article explores the differences in design processes between high school engineering students and expert engineers. It also examines the differences between high school freshmen who have taken one engineering course and seniors who have taken a series of engineering courses. Design/MethodFifty-nine high school students from four states were asked to think aloud in a three-hour design task that was audio and video recorded. Verbal reports from the audio and video became source data for protocol analysis. Results from previous studies provided expert design performance data for comparisons. ResultsStudents and experts alike spent a large portion of their time modeling. Students spent significantly less time in the process of information gathering than experts. Freshmen spent significantly less time in the idea generation process than seniors and experts. Freshmen and seniors spent significantly less time determining the feasibility of their ideas, evaluating alternative ideas, and decision making than experts. ConclusionsHigh school students engage in design thinking with little understanding of the problem from the client's perspective. Students tend to become fixated on a single solution rather than comparing alternatives. By encouraging development of alternative solutions, K-12 engineering education could foster opportunities to critically evaluate students' design solutions.

It is crucial to prepare and support teachers for integrated STEM education. However, few studies in the literature explore collaborating with teachers from different disciplines. This study investigates the effect of the professional development (PD) program designed for integrated STEM education on teachers' pedagogical design competencies and the contribution of the PD program to teachers' integrated STEM understanding. The pedagogical design competencies of the teachers were examined in terms of the level of conformity of the lesson plans they prepared based on the 5E learning model and how they unified the computational thinking components into STEM education. The program comprised 48 h and five modules. 20 computer science (CS), ten mathematics, and ten science teachers working in middle schools participated in the study. The study shows that the lesson plans developed collaboratively by the teachers were at an acceptable level in terms of integrated STEM education. However, lesson plans need to be improved. Regarding computational thinking, the teachers were more efficient in associating simulation in CS education, data analysis in mathematics education, and data collection in science education compared to other components. They were insufficient in associating components such as parallelization in CS education and automation in science and mathematics education. The teachers stated that PD program strengthens their collaboration with colleagues, contributes to pedagogical design skills in integrated STEM lesson planning and integrating STEM disciplines, and improves their understanding of integrated STEM.

Following a design science research (DSR) method, we created a gamified, "choose your own adventure" style security education, training, and awareness (SETA) artefact using two formats: text and visual. Both artefacts were designed to identify the security threats that trainees are most susceptible to, debrief them about the threat and its potential consequences, and facilitate behaviour change by letting trainees re-evaluate their decisions. Using a longitudinal randomised controlled experiment, we compared these two artefacts to no intervention and traditional security warning emails by assessing both instrumental (changes in attitudes, intentions, and OSD behaviour) and experiential (memorability and user experience) outcomes. Our survey of 1,718 employees showed that the text-based artefact was better at improving instrumental outcomes, and the visual-based artefact was better at improving experiential outcomes. This study provides a more granular understanding of the linkages between technology artefacts and human experiences through the application of design science thinking. The findings contribute to DSR by developing design principles, testable propositions, and realistic performance evaluation metrics for gamified SETA artefacts, and present practical recommendations for regulating employees' information security and privacy behaviours inside and outside the workplace.

Clinical research within bioscience companies, health care, academia, and governmental agencies could benefit from easier access to best practices, historical information, and improved information sharing. Facilitating information sharing requires a standardized information model. Information standards today focus on individual clinical trials and the representation of clinical trial data. Although work is ongoing to expand standards to cover the protocol, these are insufficient to capture the objectives, rationale, and design thinking behind clinical programs. An information model is proposed to cover the rationalization and decision-making aspects of designing a clinical program and its associated trials. This paper is the output of a newly formed multicompany working group that examines the merits of a clinical program-level information standard. An example information model is presented to explain the concept.

J	Faniel, IM; Frank, RD; Yakel, E				Faniel, Ixchel M.; Frank, Rebecca D.; Yakel, Elizabeth			Context from the data reuser's point of view	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						User studies; Research work; Information studies; Data sharing; Data curation; Data reuse	KNOWLEDGE; METADATA	Purpose Taking the researchers' perspective, the purpose of this paper is to examine the types of context information needed to preserve data's meaning in ways that support data reuse. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on a qualitative study of 105 researchers from three disciplinary communities: quantitative social science, archaeology and zoology. The study focused on researchers' most recent data reuse experience, particularly what they needed when deciding whether to reuse data. Findings Findings show that researchers mentioned 12 types of context information across three broad categories: data production information (data collection, specimen and artifact, data producer, data analysis, missing data, and research objectives); repository information (provenance, reputation and history, curation and digitization); and data reuse information (prior reuse, advice on reuse and terms of use). Originality/value This paper extends digital curation conversations to include the preservation of context as well as content to facilitate data reuse. When compared to prior research, findings show that there is some generalizability with respect to the types of context needed across different disciplines and data sharing and reuse environments. It also introduces several new context types. Relying on the perspective of researchers offers a more nuanced view that shows the importance of the different context types for each discipline and the ways disciplinary members thought about them. Both data producers and curators can benefit from knowing what to capture and manage during data collection and deposit into a repository.

Co-design of mini games for learning computational thinking in an online environment	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Online co-design; Computational thinking; Mini games; Virtual reality; Game-based learning; Smart learning environments; Nigeria	VIRTUAL-REALITY; PROGRAMMING EDUCATION; PERFORMANCE; SKILLS; K-12	Understanding the principles of computational thinking (CT), e.g., problem abstraction, decomposition, and recursion, is vital for computer science (CS) students. Unfortunately, these concepts can be difficult for novice students to understand. One way students can develop CT skills is to involve them in the design of an application to teach CT. This study focuses on co-designing mini games to support teaching and learning CT principles and concepts in an online environment. Online co-design (OCD) of mini games enhances students' understanding of problem-solving through a rigorous process of designing contextual educational games to aid their own learning. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, where face-to-face co-designing between researchers and stakeholders could be difficult, OCD is a suitable option. CS students in a Nigerian higher education institution were recruited to co-design mini games with researchers. Mixed research methods comprising qualitative and quantitative strategies were employed in this study. Findings show that the participants gained relevant knowledge, for example, how to (i) create game scenarios and game elements related to CT, (ii) connect contextual storyline to mini games, (iii) collaborate in a group to create contextual low-fidelity mini game prototypes, and (iv) peer review each other's mini game concepts. In addition, students were motivated toward designing educational mini games in their future studies. This study also demonstrates how to conduct OCD with students, presents lesson learned, and provides recommendations based on the authors' experience.

However, little is known about how useful people with lived experience of mental illness/distress might find lived-experience research, nor what the best formats are to bring it to their attention. This paper describes the STELLER study (Supporting the Translation into Everyday Life of Lived-Experience Research), which explores the translation of lived-experience research in the lives of people living with mental illness. Our aim was to use a design thinking approach to develop a range of user-friendly formats to disseminate lived-experience research. A staged design thinking approach was used to develop a translation strategy for lived-experience research. We explored empathy via consumer consultation to understand their perspectives on lived-experience research, refined the design aim, research questions and generated ideas with consumers and mental health professionals, identified the evidence based on lived experience-authored journal articles, worked with design students and peer workers to create a suite of resources and developed prototypes tailored to individual settings and clients. Participatory design thinking strategies are essential to identify the best ways to translate evidence-based lived-experience research via accessible, lay-friendly resources targeted to individuals impacted by mental illness. This study is the first to investigate the feasibility and usefulness of bringing the findings of lived-experience research to individuals impacted by mental illness/distress. It provides evidence about a potentially important source of information that can be used to facilitate their recovery.

The curriculum is central to integrating teaching and research, and is a primary source for providing undergraduate research experience. This study designed a MATLAB course for undergraduate students in Cartography and Geographic Information Science. This course integrated various models of research-teaching nexus and combined MATLAB with the profession, aiming to benefit students' learning, improve their general understanding and specific skills of research, and teach them how to conduct research. A total of 47 students were enrolled, and 37 of them completed this course. Benefits and costs of the course for students were investigated, and students' perception of the course was evaluated. Students benefited from the course in four aspects: personal gain (setback resilience and independence), understanding of knowledge synthesis (research process and problem solving), skills (literature reading and writing), and professional development (community engagement and ethical conduct). Although time costs and relatively high difficulty were reported to potentially conflict with other activities, the students still had a high degree of satisfaction and acceptance for this course.

However, designers, especially the novice designers, struggle to integrate ML into familiar design activities because of its ever-changing and growable nature. This paper proposes a design method called Material Lifecycle Thinking (MLT) that considers ML as a design material with its own lifecycle. MLT encourages designers to regard ML, users, and scenarios as three co-creators who cooperate in creating ML-empowered UX. We have developed ML Lifecycle Canvas (Canvas), a conceptual design tool that incorporates visual representations of the co-creators and ML lifecycle. Canvas guides designers to organize essential information for the application of MLT. By involving design students in the "research through design" process, the development of Canvas was iterated through its application to design projects. MLT and Canvas have been evaluated in design workshops, with completed proposals and evaluation results demonstrating that our work is a solid step forward in bridging the gap between UX and ML.

CT, which has been widely discussed in the field of education, is the ability to solve problems that use computer science concepts. For students in non-information technology fields, such as nursing students, a curriculum that integrates nursing education and information literacy can bolster evidence-based practice, enhance professional development, and encourage lifelong learning. However, the programming courses were difficult for non-information learners to apprehend, given their lack of knowledge in programming, and had a low attrition rate. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a sustainable management system in the learning process. It is also important to support the interest and confidence of the nursing learner in the programming curriculum. In this study, a programming course for nursing students was completed. A talent quality-management system (TTQS) for this programming course was built and implemented. A technology acceptance model and learning attitude questionnaires were administered to investigate learners' learning motivation and information literacy. Two nursing classes with 74 freshmen participated in the curriculum in the second semester of the 2020 academic year. The results showed that TTQS, which supports teachers in adjusting pedagogy in a timely manner, can enhance learners' motivation and performance. In this programming course, nursing students can learn CT and information concepts and improve their learning motivation through the design of learner-centred and collaborative learning.

J	Taylor, AR				Taylor, Arthur R.			Postmodernist and consumerist influences on information consumption	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Consumerism; Information retrieval; Information science; Information; Relevance; Information quality; Postmodernism	RELEVANCE CRITERIA; BEHAVIOR; PERCEPTIONS; SCIENCE	Purpose - The statement "information is a difference that makes a difference" implies causal relationships between information bits. This relationship includes the use or consumption of information. It is this consumption of information in the context of information science, consumerism, postmodernism, and the vast information technology changes of the past decades that converge to create an environment in which the veracity and general quality of information is challenged. The purpose of this paper is to examine information consumption in this context. Design/methodology/approach - This paper will examine the consumption of information within the context of information science relevance theory, consumerism, postmodernism, and significant changes in information technology, providing some historical context and examining the impact of the convergence. Relevant arguments and theory will be presented as evidence of the impact of this convergence on the quality of information. Findings - Dimensions of information quality are examined in relation to consumerism and postmodernism. Postmodern thought embraces the market and consumerism. Information production (journalism, mass media) is yet another cultural product in the market. Information production cast into the market framework is influenced by the revised sequence of capital consumer markets where demand control through advertising and marketing and pursuit of additional surplus value impact the quality of information. This leads to biased and fragmented dissemination of information. Breakdown of traditional control structures is another side effect of this convergence, leading to prosumerism (amateur) information dissemination with similar impacts on information quality. Originality/value - This paper provides a cross-disciplinary examination of the current convergence of information science, postmodernism, and capital markets within the context of consumerism. It identifies evidence of the impact of this convergence on the reduced quality of information being disseminated and consumed and provides a basis for further discussion and examination.

These organizations have gained fewer benefits from the introduction of information technology then manufacturing companies. An explanation for this finding is that current information system design methodologies do not provide the appropriate tools. They are directed at analyzing and designing information systems for control and do not make a distinction between information handling processes that are part of the control system of an organization and information processes that are part of the production system. The business process redesign approach that gets more and more attention offers a way of thinking and designing to overcome these shortcomings. Comparing business process redesign with information systems design makes the strong points of both visible. We propose an integration of business process redesign in the system design process as a solution.

Spatial cognition is a subjective judgment of a person's tendency to take action in the future and implies behavioral intention. Based on the sensory-image-cognition relationship, a theoretical model of university library readers' spatial cognition is conducted, and the influencing factors and mechanisms of spatial cognition are explored based on empirical data to provide theoretical references for spatial practices in university libraries. Design/methodology/approach A visual and art-based mental map approach is introduced based on a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire is mainly used for the specific evaluation of spatial use and the breakdown of the detailed elements, while the mental map method is mainly used for the evaluation of readers' spatial cognition. Relevant empirical data are collected from the library of the Zhejiang University of Technology. Findings The results indicate that readers' spatial sensory experience and mental imagery have positive effects on readers' behavior via the mediator spatial cognition, readers' spatial sensory experience and mental imagery have a positive effect on readers' spatial cognition and spatial cognition has a significant effect on readers' behavior. Originality/value The main contribution of this study is to construct a theoretical model of readers' spatial cognition and to explore the factors that have an impact on spatial cognition and the influence of cognition on behavior. This provides a more rational and in-depth thinking paradigm for the study of university library space and provides theoretical references for library practice.

J	Martínez, EC				Martínez, EC			Project-oriented management of batch plants.: Information system design	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering-9 (Escape-9)	MAY-JUN -, 1999	BUDAPEST, HUNGARY			batch process management; project management; systems thinking; information systems		Intense competition and rapid environmental changes are revealing severe limitations in the effectiveness of the hierarchical and functional-oriented management system currently used by the vast majority of batch manufacturing industries. A project-oriented enterprise model of batch plants is proposed here. Each project is seen as an autonomous, temporary entity within the management system, in which different types of expertise are combined to achieve a concrete goal or deliverable (e.g. completing a given order, product development, maintenance program, etc.). The cornerstone for successfully implementing this type of project-based organization is the design of an information system backbone that favors a decentralized, yet effective decision structure. To achieve this, an integrated design approach which combines a systems perspective describing the organizational complexity resulting from the multifunctional nature of projects with an analytical viewpoint emphasizing the structure of product recipes, equipment capabilities and human competencies (skills and knowledge) that are required for batch plant management is proposed. This integration is crucial to the establishment and widespread accessibility of enterprise memory, namely accumulation, adaptation and use df best practice. It is argued here that these capabilities need to be built-in as part of the information system design. A prototype implementation of the proposed design in Project 98(TM) is conceptually discussed.

Place-based learning processes in a family science workshop: Discussion prompts supporting families sensemaking and rural science connections using a community water model	SCIENCE EDUCATION			English	Article						family learning; informal learning; parent-child interactions; place-based learning; science education; Think-Pair-Share	CONVERSATIONS; EXPERIENCES; EDUCATION; PARENTS; KNOWLEDGE; CHILDREN; ENGAGEMENT; GESTURES; INQUIRY	This study addresses intergenerational learning processes in informal settings by investigating families engaging in science talk and practices during a water quality science workshop led by local science experts. As part of a larger design-based research study, this analysis examines how modified Think-Pair-Share discussion prompts within the water quality workshop curriculum supported the families' (a) sensemaking strategies and (b) place-based scientific reasoning about local water sources as they interacted with a community water model. Using sociocultural theories of learning as our foundational basis, we analyzed parent-child interactions and family sensemaking processes that took place in four workshops with 44 h of video data (12 families). Through our analysis, we identified six distinct types of sensemaking conversations that arose during the workshops: (1) family experience connection, (2) rural connection, (3) model contextualizing, (4) parent revoicing, (5) parent questioning, and (6) prediction. We also found that families spatially distributed physical gestures over three media (air, table, community water model) to support different types of sensemaking conversations. Our findings point towards the importance of family discussion prompts in informal programs as a mediational means that connects abstract science topics to local, rural experiences to support family sensemaking practices. Implications for designing family-focused science workshops in informal settings include designing discussion prompts to spark families' personally relevant connections with science and providing ample physical space for families to gesture during sensemaking conversations.

They have inflicted heavy casualties and property losses. Hence, it is necessary to design a geological information service system to analyze and evaluate geological hazards. With the development of computer and Internet service model, it is now possible to obtain rich data and process the data with some advanced computing techniques under network environment. Then, some technologies, including cyber-physical system, Internet of Things, and cloud computing, have been used in geological information management. Furthermore, the concept of cyber-physical-social-thinking as a broader vision of the Internet of Things was presented through the fusion of those advanced computing technologies. Motivated by it, in this article, a novel modeling and computing method for geological information service system is developed in consideration of the complex data processing requirement of geological service under dynamic environment. Specifically, some key techniques of modeling the information service system and computing geological data via cyber-physical system and Internet of Things are analyzed. Moreover, to show the efficiency of proposed method, two application cases are provided during the cyber-physical-social-thinking modeling and computing for geological information service system.

Scratch provides an environment to experience problem scenarios and encourages them to act out imagination while having fun. The purpose of the study is to investigate the development of reflective thinking skills towards problem solving and computational thinking of elementary school students based on their Scratch instruction. The study used a sequential exploratory design as a mixed method approach with 524 students and 8 mathematics teachers. The results of the study revealed that Scratch significantly strengthened students' reflective thinking skills for problem solving and computational thinking. Based on the results, the reflective thinking towards problem solving and computational thinking did not vary by gender. In addition, Scratch instruction led to positive reflections in the mathematical learning environment.

J	Harada, M; Nagayama, H				Harada, M; Nagayama, H			Design pattern applying support OOPAS by design diagram merging	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						design patterns; design pattern application; object-oriented design evolving; design diagram merging		Design patterns which Erich Gamma advocates: is expected as an effective approach for the reuse of designs. So, design patterns are predicted to be used frequently in object-oriented software development. In such circumstance, tools to support applying design patterns to the design diagrams of the system under development are thought to Lu useful. This research develops Object-Oriented Pattern Applying Support tool OOPAS. It consists of a library of Gamma design patterns with very familiar examples and adrem explanation, and of a function to generate the correctly modified design diagrams of the application system when a design pattern was applied to evolve that system. Actually, these functions are installed in the structured object modeling environment SOME, which is an object-oriented design diagram editor made previously in our laboratory. This design diagram evolving function is formalized as a Join operation of the recursive graph. As a result of the evaluation experiment, the join operation can be applied to the almost of the twenty three Gamma design patterns excluding the six patterns such as Iterator and Command, which are stated at too abstract level to be represented by the design diagrams.

Integrating computing within K-12 STEM supports learners of all ages in codeveloping and using computational thinking in existing curricular contexts alongside practices essential for developing mathematical and scientific expertise. In this paper, we present findings from a design-based, microgenetic study in which an agent-based programming and computational modeling platform-ViMAP-was integrated with existing elementary science and math curricula through lessons co-designed and taught by the classroom teacher across a period of seven months. We present a dialogical re-positioning of coding, where disciplinarily grounded meanings of code emerge through the construction of computational utterances--i.e., computer models as well as complementary conversations and physical models that serve as mathematical and scientific explanations--through the use of socio-mathematical norms.

Sharing information between PPC professionals is, therefore, essential for quality care. The evidence shows that electronic cross-facility health records (ECHRs) provide useful support in this context. To our knowledge, no ECHRs have been developed through a user-centered approach for this specific setting in Germany. Methods: Guided by design thinking, first, qualitative interviews were conducted to assess the needs of PPC professionals. Second, the elicited needs were specified in focus groups (FGs). Based on the needs stated in the interviews, prototypes of the ECHR were developed and discussed in the FGs. The indicated needs were supplemented and specified in an iterative process. The prototypes were further adapted according to these results. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology was the basic model in the evaluation of needs. Results: Across seven main categories, past and current medication, emergency view, and messaging functions were identified as the participants' desired core components of an ECHR. Utilizing design thinking facilitated the explicit articulation of user needs. Conclusions: Developing an ECHR with the content identified would allow for real-time data during emergencies, tracking what other PPC professionals have done, and making the applied treatments visible to others. This would offer a broader picture of the complex conditions common to PPC.

J	Sabel, JL; Forbes, CT; Flynn, L				Sabel, Jaime L.; Forbes, Cory T.; Flynn, Leslie			Elementary teachers' use of content knowledge to evaluate students' thinking in the life sciences	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION			English	Article						Elementary science; life science; formative assessment; elementary teachers	FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT; CONCEPTIONS; PRESERVICE; INQUIRY; INSTRUCTION	Science learning environments should provide opportunities for students to make sense of and enhance their understanding of disciplinary concepts. Teachers can support students' sense-making by engaging and responding to their ideas through high-leverage instructional practices such as formative assessment (FA). However, past research has shown that teachers may not understand FA, how to implement it, or have sufficient content knowledge to use it effectively. Few studies have investigated how teachers gather information to evaluate students' ideas or how content knowledge factors into those decisions, particularly within the life science discipline. We designed a study embedded in a multi-year professional development program that supported elementary teachers' development of disciplinary knowledge and FA practices within science instruction. Study findings illustrate how elementary teachers' life science content knowledge influences their evaluation of students' ideas. Teachers with higher levels of life science content knowledge more effectively evaluated students' ideas than teachers with lower levels of content knowledge. Teachers with higher content exam scores discussed both content and student understanding to a greater extent, and their analyses of students' ideas were more scientifically accurate compared to teachers with lower scores. These findings contribute to theory and practice around science teacher education, professional development, and curriculum development.

A multi-institutional, grant-funded project employed mixed methods to study 175 fourth-grade through graduate school students' point-of-selection behaviour. The method features the use of simulated search engine results pages to facilitate data collection. Method. Student participants used simulated Google results pages to select resources for a hypothetical school project. Quantitative data on participants' selection behaviour and qualitative data from their think-aloud protocols were collected. A questionnaire and interviews were used to collect data on participants' backgrounds and online research experiences. Analysis. This paper reflects on the data collection methods and highlights opportunities for data analysis. The ability to analyse data both qualitatively and quantitatively increases the rigor and depth of findings. Results. The simulation created a realistic yet controlled environment that ensures the comparability of data within and across a wide range of educational stages. Combining data on participants' behaviour, thoughts and characteristics provides a more complete picture of factors influencing online resource selection. Conclusions. Using simulated results pages in combination with multiple data collection methods enables analyses that create deeper knowledge of participants' information behaviour. Such a complicated research design requires extensive time, expertise and coordination to execute.

We tested this during a Collaborative Sketching (C-Sketch) ideation exercise with first-year undergraduate student designers. We focus on four types of stimuli-quantitative requirements, a visual example (video), a physical example, and contextual information-and we measure creativity according to three metrics-novelty, appropriateness, and usability with either the participants' gender or the gender diversity of the participants' groups. The findings suggest that the main effect of providing a video example results in high appropriateness and usability scores but low novelty scores and that physical-contextual briefs have high novelty and usability scores. In addition, we did not find any correlation between gender or gender diversity and creativity scores.

Older Cancer Patients' User Experiences With Web-Based Health Information Tools: A Think-Aloud Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						user experience; eHealth; usability; think aloud; aging; cancer	INTERNET USERS; DECISION AIDS; USABILITY; IMPROVE; COMMUNICATION; TECHNOLOGY; EDUCATION; CARE	Background: Health information is increasingly presented on the Internet. Several Web design guidelines for older Web users have been proposed; however, these guidelines are often not applied in website development. Furthermore, although we know that older individuals use the Internet to search for health information, we lack knowledge on how they use and evaluate Web-based health information. Objective: This study evaluates user experiences with existing Web-based health information tools among older (>= 65 years) cancer patients and survivors and their partners. The aim was to gain insight into usability issues and the perceived usefulness of cancer-related Web-based health information tools. Methods: We conducted video-recorded think-aloud observations for 7 Web-based health information tools, specifically 3 websites providing cancer-related information, 3 Web-based question prompt lists (QPLs), and 1 values clarification tool, with colorectal cancer patients or survivors (n= 15) and their partners (n= 8) (median age: 73; interquartile range 70-79). Participants were asked to think aloud while performing search, evaluation, and application tasks using the Web-based health information tools. Results: Overall, participants perceived Web-based health information tools as highly useful and indicated a willingness to use such tools. However, they experienced problems in terms of usability and perceived usefulness due to difficulties in using navigational elements, shortcomings in the layout, a lack of instructions on how to use the tools, difficulties with comprehensibility, and a large amount of variety in terms of the preferred amount of information. Although participants frequently commented that it was easy for them to find requested information, we observed that the large majority of the participants were not able to find it. Conclusions: Overall, older cancer patients appreciate and are able to use cancer information websites. However, this study shows the importance of maintaining awareness of age-related problems such as cognitive and functional decline and navigation difficulties with this target group in mind. The results of this study can be used to design usable and useful Web-based health information tools for older (cancer) patients.	[Bolle, Sifra; Romijn, Geke; Loos, Eugene F.; van Weert, Julia C.

Given the importance of identifying key determinants of child health via capturing and integrating accurate and high-quality information, we aim to address this gap through the development and testing requirements for an integrated child health information system. Subjects and Methods A five-phase design thinking approach including empathizing, defining, ideation, prototyping, and testing was applied. We employed observations and interviews with the health workers at the primary health care network to identify end-users' challenges and needs using tools in human-centered design and focus group discussion. Then, a potential solution to the identified problems was developed as an integrated maternal and child health information system (IMCHIS) prototype and tested using Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation Model (SQuaRE) ISO/IEC 25000. Results IMCHIS was developed as a web-based system with 74 data elements and seven maternal and child health care requirements. The requirements of "child disease" with weight (0.26), "child nutrition" with weight (0.20), and "prenatal care" with weight (0.16) acquired the maximum weight coefficient. In the testing phase, the highest score with the weight coefficient of 0.48 and 0.73 was attributed to efficiency and functionality characteristics, focusing on software capability to fulfill the tasks that meet users' needs. Conclusion Implementing a successful child health care system integrates both maternal and child health care information systems to track the effect of maternal conditions on child health and support managing performance and optimizing service delivery. The highest quality score of IMCHIS in efficiency and functionality characteristics confirms that it owns the capability to identify key determinants of child health.

Waste management is no exception. In the modern era, the treatment and disposal of infectious waste should be seen as an opportunity to generate renewable energy, resource efficiency, and, above all, to improve the population's quality of life. Northern Italy currently produces 66,600 tons/year of infectious waste, mostly treated through incineration plants. This research aims to explore a more ecological and sustainable solution, thereby contributing one more step toward achieving better cities for all. Particularly, this paper presents a conceptual design of the main sterilization chamber for infectious waste. The methodology selected was Design Thinking (DT), since it has a user-centered approach which allows for co-design and the inclusion of the target population. This study demonstrates to the possibility of obtaining feasible results based on the user's needs through the application of DT as a framework for engineering design.

J	Aytekin, A; Topcu, MS				Aytekin, Aydan; Topcu, Mustafa Sami			The effect of integrating computational thinking (CT) components into science teaching on 6th grade students' learning of the circulatory system concepts and CT skills	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Early Access						Circulatory system; Computational thinking; Conceptual learning; Teaching modules	NATURAL-SELECTION; K-12	Circulatory system is a challenging subject for middle school students to learn and understand conceptual relationships. To address these challenges, this study developed plugged (computational thinking activities using computer) and unplugged (computational thinking activities without using computer) teaching modules that integrated computational thinking components into the circulatory system topic. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of these teaching modules on the conceptual learning and computational thinking skills of 6th grade students. A quasi-experimental design was employed with experimental group 1 using plugged instructional modules, experimental group 2 using unplugged instructional modules and the control group following an inquiry-based constructivist approach aligned with the Turkish science curriculum. These interventions were implemented over a period of 16 lesson hours (4 weeks) for all three groups. The researchers used the Circulatory System Conceptual Learning and Computational Thinking Skills Scale (CSCL-CTSS) as a data collection tool. The results of the study indicated that both experimental group 1 (n = 30) and experimental group 2 (n = 30) showed significantly higher success in circulatory system conceptual learning and computational thinking skills compared to the control group (n = 30). Therefore, this experimental study provides a concrete example of integrating computational thinking into science teaching and presents innovative educational approaches that can enhance the learning of challenging science concepts. Furthermore, it compares the effectiveness of these innovative educational approaches (plugged and unplugged implementations) in developing conceptual learning and computational thinking skills.

Current creative thinking courses for college students are affected by COVID-19 and are challenging to conduct. This study aimed to explore practical ways to teach creative thinking knowledge online and explored design opportunities for working on this teaching activity online. Through qualitative interviews, we found that the factors that influenced the design of the online virtual simulation course platform were focused on five dimensions: information presentation, platform characteristics, course assessment, instruction design, and presentation format. Through the analysis of user requirements, we obtained six corresponding design guidelines. Based on the knowledge system of design thinking, we set up eight modules in the course platform and developed a prototype including 100 user interfaces. We invited three experts and 30 users to conduct cognitive walk-through sessions and made design iterations based on the feedback. After user evaluation, dimensions of attractiveness, efficiency, dependability, and novelty reached excellent rating and were recognized by users.

The goal of this study was to promote and evaluate the development of data analysis (DA) skills in undergraduate students through targeted interventions in environmental science courses. We developed materials to promote practice, instruction, and assessment of four core DA dimensions: the ability to make appropriate calculations, convert data to graphical representations, interpret graphical or mathematical information, and draw conclusions based on the analysis of data. We integrated two conservation exercises as pre/post assessment tools, flanking differentiated teaching interventions, into selected science courses and used a standardized rubric to measure students' performance level. We found that students improved their DA skills in a single semester, but the level of improvement varied across skill dimensions. Students struggled with dimensions that require higher levels of thinking such as data interpretation and drawing conclusions. The use of additional exercises targeting these dimensions and alternative practices might enhance gains. Importantly, students also gained content knowledge in ecological principles while developing skills, and demonstrated an increase in self-confidence with their DA skills. Our approach and open-access materials can be integrated into existing courses to develop and assess data skills in undergraduate learners.

Countries around the world attach importance to software's ability as one of the key elements for training future human resources. In order to train software centered human resources, each university has designated Software Education as an essential curriculum for not only major but also non-majors. In the past Software Education was an education for a major, but recent Software Education was changed to the essential education that is necessary for all living in the software centered world. In the past the curriculum was focused on software development and implementation-oriented education, but recent curriculum emphasizes sequential arranging and thinking of problem solving. In order to reflect trends in recent Software Education in detail, we integrate Software Education with major concept of Computational Thinking. In this paper, we analyzed the effect of the main concept of Computational Thinking on Software Education for non-majored learners who received Software Education based on Computational Thinking (here refers to learners who major in humanities, social sciences and arts). In addition, research models of satisfaction, self-efficacy, and occupational change was established as the elements of Software Education, and it was found that there was a relation between Computational Thinking and Software Education.

However, previous research has mainly focused on cancer information overload and the corresponding consequence, and failed to examine its adverse effects in the context of major public health events. Based on the Frustrate Aggression Theory and the Scapegoat Theory, the present study established a moderated mediation model to investigate the emotional and behavioral outcomes of COVID-19 information overload. The mediating role of depression/anxiety in the association between COVID-19 information overload and cyber aggression, as well as the moderating role of Confucian responsibility thinking, were tested. This model was examined with 1005 Chinese people (mean age = 26.91 years, SD = 9.94) during the COVID-19 outbreak. Mediation analyses revealed that COVID-19 information overload was positively related to cyber aggression, depression, and anxiety, parallelly and partially mediated this relationship. Moderated mediation analyses further indicated that Confucian responsibility thinking not only moderated the direct link between COVID-19 information overload and cyber aggression, with the effect being significant only for people with a low level of Confucian responsibility thinking, but also moderated the relationship between COVID-19 information overload and depression/anxiety respectively, with the associations being much more potent for individuals with low levels of Confucian responsibility thinking. These findings have the potential to inform the development of prevention and intervention programs designed to reduce the negative emotions and cyber aggression associated with information overload in public health events.

It seeks to complement methods for measuring performance in construction by providing feedback and capturing perceptions of design quality embodied in buildings. The research team worked closely with the sponsors and an industry steering group to develop the indicators that could be readily used by clients and practitioners to better understand and promote value through design. The development and piloting process was explored within a context of lessons from earlier attempts by others. The three main elements of the DQI toolkit (conceptual framework, data-gathering tool, weighting mechanism) mapped the value of buildings in relation to their design for different uses and their ability to meet a variety of physical, aspirational and emotional needs of occupants and users. The DQI pilot studies consisting of five design and construction projects are discussed along with their graphical representation of results generated by end-users, individual team members and project teams. The process raises questions about the difficulties in the description and application of indicators for design quality. It is argued that the benefit of the DQI is a 'tool for thinking', rather than an absolute measure, because it has the potential to capture lessons from current building design for strategic future use as well as initiate, represent and inform discussions involving designers', clients', producers' and end-users' perceptions on the tangible and intangible aspects of possibilities within live design projects. The limitations of the approach, the next phase of development and further research issues are raised.

J	Magnussen, R; Hod, Y				Magnussen, Rikke; Hod, Yotam			Bridging communities and schools in Urban development: community and citizen science	INSTRUCTIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Community and citizen science; Design-based research; Urban development	PARTICIPATION; GAMES	This paper presents the results of two community and citizen science research projects - Cities at Play and Community Drive - in which young students (aged 11-15) from vulnerable residential areas in Copenhagen, Denmark, collaborated with architects and urban developers to engage in urban development initiatives in their neighborhoods. An educational design was developed over the two research projects in which students underwent phases of discovery, interpretation, ideation, and experimentation. Data were collected from surveys, observations, and interviews to elucidate the ways that three bridges central to community and citizen science projects can function. These include professional (bridges student learning in school and professional communities outside school), citizen (bridges student learning in school and local communities), and student (bridges student learning in school and new student communities) bridges. This research makes both theoretical and practical advancements. Theoretically, it advances our thinking about the diverse roles that participants in multi-sector partnerships can have, as well as how CCS widens the view of cultural asset-based learning by viewing students as experts of their local communities. Practically, we offer four guidelines that were gleaned from the results that can be instructive for the design of future educational community and citizen science projects.

However, it remains a challenge for most students to complete scientific inquiry tasks without proper support. Research evidence has suggested the potential of reflective scaffolding when applying scientific inquiry. Accordingly, we designed a contextualised reflective mechanism-based AR learning model to assist students in completing scientific inquiry tasks. Guided by the proposed model, we designed four stages of scientific inquiry learning: conceptual understanding, reflective cognition, in-depth inquiry, and knowledge building. A quasi-experiment and lag sequential analysis were conducted by recruiting 81 sixth-grade students to examine the effects of the proposed model on their scientific inquiry learning performances, higher order thinking, and behavioural patterns. The experimental results reveal that the proposed approach improved students' inquiry learning performances and higher order thinking tendency (problem-solving tendency and metacognitive awareness). Moreover, the evidence from this study also suggests that the students who learned with the proposed approach exhibited more observation, comparison, exploration, and reflection behavioural patterns in the field trip than those who learned without the contextualised reflective mechanism. Implications are discussed.

By catering to personal preferences, they confirm existing opinions and reinforce cognitive biases. When it comes to polarizing topics such as climate change or abortion rights, the combination of algorithmic information curation and cognitive biases can easily skew our perception and, thus, undermine our critical thinking abilities while creating a thriving ground for misinformation. To curb the spread of misinformation, a research agenda is needed around the interplay between cognitive biases, computing systems, and online platform design. In this article, we synthesize insights from a workshop series, propose a research agenda, and sketch out a blueprint for technologies to support critical thinking through the lens of human-computer interaction and design. We discuss the affordances of online media and how they could prioritize teaching users how to spot misinformation better and conduct themselves in online environments.

J	Krippendorff, K				Krippendorff, Klaus			The cybernetics of design and the design of cybernetics	KYBERNETES			English	Article						cybernetics; sciences; design		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to connect two discourses, the discourse of cybernetics and that of design. Design/methodology/approach - The paper takes a comparative analysis of relevant definitions, concepts, and entailments in both discourse, and an integration of these into a cybernetically informed concept of human-centered design, on the one hand, and a design-informed concept of second-order cybernetics, on the other hand. In the course of this conceptual exploration, the distinction between science and design is explored with cybernetics located in the dialectic between the two. Technology-centered design is distinguished from human-centered design, and several axioms of the latter are stated and discussed. Findings - This paper consists of recommendations to think and do things differently. In particular, a generalization of interface is suggested as a replacement for the notion of products; a concept of meaning is developed to substitute for the meaninglessness of physical properties; a theory of stakeholder networks is discussed to replace the deceptive notion of THE user; and, above all, it is suggested that designers, in order to design something that affords use to others, engage in second-order understanding. Originality/value - The paper makes several radical suggestions that face likely rejection by traditionalists but acceptance by cyberneticians and designers attempting to make a contribution to contemporary information society.

Using a design thinking approach, a range of human-centered problems in communication were identified that could provide the motivation for a wide range of research. Nine main research programs were distilled and are summarized: (a) measuring brain and other physiological parameters, (b) auditory and multimodal displays of information, (c) auditory scene analysis, (d) enabling and understanding shared auditory virtual spaces, (e) holistic approaches to health management and hearing impairment, (f) universal access to evolving and individualized technologies, (g) biological intervention for hearing dysfunction, (h) understanding the psychosocial interactions with technology and other humans as mediated by technology, and (i) the impact of changing models of security and privacy. The design thinking approach attempted to link the judged level of importance of different research areas to the end in mind through empathy for the real-life problems embodied in the personas created during the workshop.

However, in spite of the consolidation of the information derived from academic research, it is noticed that different organizations have not yet adopted this practice, orienting their management processes towards the environmental theme in a reactive, linear and closed way. Therefore, the present article investigates the Design Thinking (DT) ability to engage stakeholders, having as object micro, small and medium size furniture enterprises (SMEs). Based on a descriptive research, applied to those responsible for the area of product development in the furniture industry, we found that managers recognize that DT's characteristics and strategies can favor the engagement of users, distribution channels, internal agents, suppliers, external agents, sponsors and the community. However, we also note that for the feasibility of adopting the approach, there is a need for companies to establish an appropriate background. Finally, we propose a generic model for using DT as an alternative in the engagement of stakeholders. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre -service teachers. Quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the UCT-STEM approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the STEM approach were administered to the control group. Post-test scores for CT skills showed a statis-tically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. It was concluded that the UCT-STEM approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers' CT skills than the STEM approach. The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers' CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs.

J	Lin, C				Lin, Chang			The New Thinking on Furniture Design Based on Ecological Demand	AGRO FOOD INDUSTRY HI-TECH			English	Article						Ecological demand; environmental protection; furniture design; environmental meaning		The social system has changed from an industrial society to an information society along with the continuous development of the economy. Economic expansion raised people's demand for quality living environments. An industrial society also results in an ecological crisis because of population expansion, which depletes resources and causes environmental deterioration, ultimately destroying the quality of people's living environment and strengthening their awareness on environmental protection. Furniture is the most basic item in people's living environment, and whether or not its material design is environmental is considered important. On the basis of these facts, the destruction of the ecological environment because of the development in human society was introduced in this paper. With a simple introduction of the case of China's furniture harming human health, the whole situation of China's furniture industry was introduced briefly, and the problems of Chinese wooden furniture were analyzed. The innovative environmental wood materials of polyurethane imitation were summarized. Bending and compressive strength were detected using the performance testing formula, and according to the performance test results, the advantages of polyurethane imitation wood materials were summarized. Then, the environmental protection of polyurethane imitation wood material was analyzed in terms of its applicability to furniture, and a theoretical basis for the new thinking on furniture design based on ecological demand was completed.

School systems will need to give increased attention to opportunities for students to engage in computational thinking and ways to promote a deeper understanding of how technologies and software are used as design tools. However, K-12 students in the United States are facing a broken pipeline for CS education. In response to this problem, we have developed the Scalable Game Design curriculum based on a strategy to integrate CS education into the regular school curriculum. This strategy includes opportunities for students to design and program games and science technology engineering and mathematics simulations. An approach called Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis has been developed to measure and correlate computational thinking skills relevant to game design and simulations.

J	Todhunter, F				Todhunter, Fern			Using concurrent think-aloud and protocol analysis to explore student nurses' social learning information communication technology knowledge and skill development	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Article						Concurrent think-aloud; Protocol analysis; Social learning; Information and Communication Technology; Observational software	VALIDITY	Observations obtained through concurrent think-aloud and protocol analysis offer new understanding about the influence of social learning on student nurses' acquisition of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) knowledge and skills. The software used provides a permanent record of the underpinning study method, events and analyses. The emerging themes reflect the dimensions of social engagement, and the characteristics of positive and negative reactions to ICT. The evidence shows that given the right conditions, stronger learners will support and guide their peers. Aims: To explore the use of concurrent think-aloud and protocol analysis as a method to examine how student nurses approach ICT. To identify the benefits and challenges of using observational technology to capture learning behaviours. To show the influence of small group arrangement and student interactions on their ICT knowledge and skills development. Background: Previous studies examining social interaction between students show how they work together and respond to interactive problem solving. Social interaction has been shown to enhance skills in both ICT and collaborative decision making. Design: Structured observational analysis using concurrent think-aloud and protocol analysis. Results: Students displayed varying degrees of pastoral support and emotional need, leadership, reflection, suggestion and experimentation skills. Conclusion: Encouraging student nurses to work in small mixed ability groups can be conducive for social and ICT skill and knowledge development. Observational software gives a permanent record of the proceedings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In addition to some curricula requiring computing & reasoning and operation & demonstration, the situations of teachers utilizing transparencies, films, and network communications present that digitalized materials have become the mainstream teaching instruments. Creative Thinking Instruction is also largely promoted in school education that various creative teaching strategies are created. Such teaching strategies or models aim to develop and cultivate students' creative teaching abilities through various effective routes and approaches. The effects of teaching approaches and strategies on students' learning achievements and interests as well as the use of distinct teaching strategies and approaches for the promotion of teaching effectiveness are considered as the research motivation. The quasi-experimental research is preceded with the nonequivalent pretest posttest control group design model, where 104 students in two classes in a national university are selected for the experiment. The research results show that 1. Creative Thinking Instruction presents higher sensitivity than general traditional instruction, 2. Creative Thinking Instruction reveals higher fluency than general traditional instruction, 3. Immersion in virtual reality appears the highest sensitivity on Creative Thinking Instruction, and 4. Interaction in virtual reality presents the highest fluency on Creative Thinking Instruction	[Hu, Ridong; Wu, Yi-Yong; Shieh, Chich-Jen] Huaqiao Univ, Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, Peoples R China	Huaqiao University	Shieh, CJ (corresponding author), Huaqiao Univ, Coll Econ & Finance, Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, Peoples R China.	charleshieh@gmail.com							29	35	37	12	110	MODESTUM LTD	LONDON	STE 124 CHALLENGE HOUSE 616 MITCHAM RD, CROYDON, LONDON, CRO 3AA, ENGLAND	1305-8215	1305-8223		EURASIA J MATH SCI T	Eurasia J.

This contributes to the fragmented knowledge and low motivational and creative involvement of learners in system design tasks. In addition, present ISD methodologies, including web design methodologies, do not focus sufficiently on technological problem solving and design. Engagement in system design tasks demands critical thinking [Shelly, Cashman & Rosenblatt, 2001, Systems Analysis and Design, 4th edn. Course Technology, Boston] and abstraction skills [Harris, 1999, Systems Analysis and Design for the Small Enterprise, The Dryden Press, Harcourt Brace College Publishers, Fort Worth]. The aim of this paper is to explain a synergy between the technological process and web design methodology and its influence on the development of the cognitive skills of learners in the ISD context. In this research, the Team Structure Software Process (TSSP) methodology was integrated with the stages of the technological process. An interface approach between Information Systems and Technology Education was adopted during the implementation of an Instructional Web Design Program (IWDP), which served as a framework for building a software product. This research was based on a qualitative, action-research approach where individual interviews, focus group interviews, observation and document sources were used to gather data. Seventeen students at an institution of higher education were observed and their experiences were investigated through a focus group interview, journals and an essay. In addition, an interview with the teacher was conducted to investigate her thoughts and feelings during the implementation of the IWDP. During the implementation of the IWDP, multi-method learning was promoted, enlarging learners' insight into the design process and a climate for enhancing intellectual processes and skills created [Jakovljevic, 2002, An Instructional Model for Teaching Complex Thinking through Web Page Design, DEd thesis, Rand Afrikaan University, Johannesburg].

J	Wang, SH; Wang, H				Wang, Shouhong; Wang, Hai			Organizational schemata of e-portfolios for fostering higher-order thinking	INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS			English	Article						Semantic Web; System analysis and design; User-computer interface; Object-oriented; E-portfolio; Higher-order thinking; Ontology; E-learning; Learning objects; Business education; Information systems education	DESIGN; ONTOLOGY; CONCEPTIONS; SYSTEMS; SCIENCE	The information technology of online e-portfolio systems have been widely used during the past several years along with the diffusion of electronic teaching-learning systems. However, for the time being e-portfolio is viewed more as an assessment tool or a showcase tool, but less as an active learning tool. The current generic e-portfolio systems store artifacts in the chronological order on the course basis, providing few facets for active thinking. The question of how we can make e-portfolio a useful learning tool to improve students' learning outcomes is still open to research. Among various students' learning outcomes, higher-order thinking has become an important outcome of education. One vision of education evolution is to change the modes of thinking of students. This study is to meet the challenge of e-portfolios by investigating a significant research question: how e-portfolios can be used as a learning tool for students to foster higher-order thinking. Specifically, this study proposes an ontological approach to organizational schema of e-portfolios so that e-portfolios can be logically and dynamically organized into thinking-driven networks. The ontological schemata can serve as visible maps for the virtual e-portfolios repository shared by all teachers and students to foster higher-order thinking. A case study that implements a prototype of organizational schemata of e-portfolios demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach for fostering higher-order thinking.

Teaching the integration of information systems technologies	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION			English	Article						decision making; design evaluation; design science; information systems education; technical integration		A curriculum for a master's level course called Integrating Information Systems Technologies is presented. The course content is drawn from industry practice, and teaches ways of integrating large scale information systems. The teaching method used is similar to the method used to teach architecture. Students are asked to design complex systems in the form of posters; in each class these posters are discussed. Course evaluations from 95 students suggest that students find posters more effective than written papers and slide presentations. Specifically, students find that posters not only encourage visualization, but also provide them a way of seeing the thought processes of fellow students.

J	Uzumcu, O; Bay, E				Uzumcu, Ozlem; Bay, Erdal			The effect of computational thinking skill program design developed according to interest driven creator theory on prospective teachers	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Computational thinking; Twenty-first century skill; IDC theory; Unplugged activities; Program design	FRAMEWORK; K-12	It is likely to observe that the increase in data and the interrelated challenges in digital age complicates the problems to be encountered. Therefore, unprecedented problem-solving skills have become inevitable. Though dating back to old times, computational thinking skill is defined as a recent skill area that is required by everybody, that can be used to solve the aforementioned complex problems, and that is included in international standards and training programs. In this study, it was aimed to improve computational thinking skills of prospective teachers. In order to do this, a program design which includes contents that prospective theachers can use in daily life and professional life has been developed. This program, which consists mostly of unplugged activities, also includes computer aided and robotic activities. A total of 11 voluntary prospective teachers (7 women and 4 men), who were in their 3rd year of the 4 year education in the 2017-2018 fall semester and did not attend to any programming or computational thinking education training before, participated in the study. In the first application, a 40-h program was carried out with five prospective teachers, while in the second application, an updated 52-h program was carried out with six prospective teachers. A skill test was developed, and applied to measure prospective teachers' computational thinking skills before and after the prepared program. Moreover, at the end of the training, they were asked to preapare graduation projects and their perspectives on education were examined. It has been observed that the program applied to prospective primary education teachers, who did not take any lessons like programming etc. before, was effective according to the computational thinking related skill tests and their graduation projects. It has been also observed in prospective primary education teachers that their thinking skills such as problem solving and questioning were improved and they could reflect their acquired knowledge and skills to their daily and professional life.

Despite various pedagogical and technological innovations, the learning effectiveness of the new learning environments is still being debated. Systems thinking concepts and methods are needed regarding how to accommodate digital technology to optimize the efficacy of students' learning, especially when student cohort specificities are addressed. For the purpose of this study, we used an empirical research design supported by a bibliometric analysis. Multiple regression using dummy coding of the predictor variables was conducted to compare the prediction models across different groups of first-year students, while a sequential mediation model was used to examine the students' perceptions of systems thinking, engagement in the design course, and information communication technology (ICT) self-concept in relation to academic achievements. The results indicate that systems thinking centered around the understanding of feedback behaviors and causal sequences in the system has a direct effect on the design outcome and ICT self-concept related to problem solving and cognitive engagement, while, indirectly, systems thinking also mediates achievement in design courses. The ICT self-concept related to problem solving and cognitive engagement mediates the relationship between systems thinking and design course achievement. This study highlights the importance of leveraging learning system dynamics factors in diverse student cohort design courses and provides implications for developing a high-performance digital education sustainable ecosystem.

Such tools build on design thinking techniques to allow management practitioners to jointly inquire into specific strategic management problems. As the interest in and the emergence of visual inquiry tools gain momentum, it is important to formalize the design knowledge that future designers can build on to develop such tools. Thus, we propose a design theory for visual inquiry tools based on the design knowledge accumulated within and across three projects: the Business Model Canvas, the Value Proposition Canvas, and the Team Alignment Map. We outline the design principles (among others) that should be followed for developing visual inquiry tools for other strategic management problems. Our study addresses the lack of guidance in the development of visual inquiry tools and the lack of methodological guidance in design science research on how to theorize and formalize knowledge across multiple projects. We provide a methodological process for analyzing multiple-project data by bridging methodological insights from design science research and qualitative methods from the social sciences.

Evaluating the effects of cognitive support on psychiatric clinical comprehension	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Biomedical informatics; Cognitive science; Clinical comprehension; Cognitive support; Latent semantic analysis; Propositional analysis; Verbal protocol analysis; Psychiatry; Emergency psychiatry	LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS; KNOWLEDGE	Objective: Clinicians' attention is a precious resource, which in the current healthcare practice is consumed by the cognitive demands arising from complex patient conditions, information overload, time pressure, and the need to aggregate and synthesize information from disparate sources. The ability to organize information in ways that facilitate the generation of effective diagnostic solutions is a distinguishing characteristic of expert physicians, suggesting that automated systems that organize clinical information in a similar manner may augment physicians' decision-making capabilities. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of a theoretically driven cognitive support system (CSS) that assists psychiatrists in their interpretation of clinical cases. The system highlights, and provides the means to navigate to, text that is organized in accordance with a set of diagnostically and therapeutically meaningful higher-level concepts. Methods and materials: To evaluate the interface, 16 psychiatry residents interpreted two clinical case scenarios, with and without the CSS. Think-aloud protocols captured during their interpretation of the cases were transcribed and analyzed qualitatively. In addition, the frequency and relative position of content related to key higher-level concepts in a verbal summary of the case were evaluated. In addition the transcripts from both groups were compared to an expert derived reference standard using latent semantic analysis (LSA). Results: Qualitative analysis showed that users of the system better attended to specific clinically important aspects of both cases when these were highlighted by the system, and revealed ways in which the system mediates hypotheses generation and evaluation. Analysis of the summary data showed differences in emphasis with and without the system. The LSA analysis suggested users of the system were more "expert-like" in their emphasis, and that cognitive support was more effective in the more complex case. Conclusions: Cognitive support impacts upon clinical comprehension. This appears to be largely helpful, but may also lead to neglect of information (such as the psychosocial history) that the system does not highlight. The results have implications for the design of CSSs for clinical narratives including the role of information organization and textual embellishments for more efficient clinical case presentation and comprehension.

However, users gain little support from search engines for their cognitive and metacognitive activities (e.g., discovery, synthesis, planning, transformation, monitoring, and reflection) during exploratory searches. To better support the exploratory search process, we designed a new search assistance tool called OrgBox. OrgBox allows users to drag-and-drop information they find during searches into "boxes" and "items" that can be created, labeled, and rearranged on a canvas. We conducted a controlled, within-subjects user study with 24 participants to evaluate the OrgBox versus a baseline tool called the OrgDoc that supported rich-text features. Our findings show that participants perceived the OrgBox tool to provide more support for grouping and reorganizing information, tracking thought processes, planning and monitoring search and task processes, and gaining a visual overview of the collected information. The usability test reveals users' preferences for simplicity, familiarity, and flexibility of the design of OrgBox, along with technical problems such as delay of response and restrictions of use. Our results have implications for the design of search-assisting systems that encourage cognitive and metacognitive activities during exploratory search processes.

Two of the seven steps in this process involve collecting and sharing meaningful evidence with appropriate stakeholders, often for advocacy purposes, strategically selecting communication channels and methods aligned with target audiences. Through a survey collecting both quantitative and qualitative data, 161 school librarians in Kentucky, Virginia, and Texas shared their experiences with evidence-based practice. The study reported here focuses on school librarians' evidence collection and sharing practices. Findings indicate school librarians collect easily obtainable data and share evidence of practice widely; however, they are most likely to share with building-level administrators, and the channels through which they communicate with school personnel differ from those chosen to communicate with other stakeholder groups. Approximately half of participants share evidence for advocacy purposes, and only slightly more than half share evidence of their practice with other school librarians.

The introduction of online learning technologies and the focus on independent and critical thinking actualizes the problem of developing these skills in future teachers and lawyers with the help of digital tools. The study looked at the critical thinking development in education while focusing on the use of digital tools in rational thinking formation in education. The research involved a random sample of under-graduate pedagogy students from [BLINDED] Institute of [BLINDED] University and graduate law students from [BLINDED] Institute. The digital tools were used to develop test tasks and logic problems, present information in graphical form, brainstorm, and collaborate in real-time to solve the created problems. The level of critical thinking development was assessed in dynamics using the method designed by Mishina based on the research Diane Halpern, Igor Zageshev, and Sergei Zair-Beck. The outcomes confirm the original hypothesis about the positive impact of digital tools on the formation of critical thinking in students.

J	van den Heuvel, C; Rayward, WB				van den Heuvel, Charles; Rayward, W. Boyd			Facing Interfaces: Paul Otlet's Visualizations of Data Integration	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							DOCUMENTATION; INFORMATION	The arbitrary division into lines and pages of the book in its present format, does not correspond at all, with the presentation of ideas. (Otlet, 1911, p. 291) Most historical explanations of interfaces are technological and start with the computer age. We propose a different approach by focusing on the history of library and information sciences, particularly on the case of Paul Otlet (1868-1944). Otlet's attempts to integrate and distribute knowledge imply the need for interfaces, and his conceptualizations are reminiscent of modern versions of interfaces that are intended to facilitate manual and mechanical data integration and enrichment. Our discussion is based on a selection from the hundreds of images of what we may think of as "interfaces" that Otlet made or commissioned during his life. We examine his designs for interfaces that involve bibliographic cards, that allow data enrichment, his attempts to visualize interfaces between the sciences and between universal and personal classifications, and even his attempts to create interfaces to the world. In particular, we focus on the implications of Otlet's dissection of the organization of the book for the creation of interfaces to a new order of public knowledge. Our view is that the creative ways in which he faces tensions of scalability, representation, and perception of relationships between knowledge objects might be of interest today.

The participants were 86 undergraduate students who participated in an 18-week experimental instruction of information management in which bingo games and Socrative were employed. Both the qualitative and quantitative data were analysed. The results showed that while the bingo games may carry more effects on enhancing learning motivation, Socrative may lead to more knowledge sharing and critical thinking. In addition, both instructional methods had positive influences on learning outcomes through different mechanisms and shared mechanisms. The shared mechanisms included focused attention, brainstorming, active participation, interaction and logical thinking. Notably, there were interactions among motivation, knowledge sharing and critical thinking; moreover, the blended approach, which integrated the bingo games and Socrative, improved the participants' critical thinking ability.

J	Pigliucci, M; Boudry, M				Pigliucci, Massimo; Boudry, Maarten			Why Machine-Information Metaphors are Bad for Science and Science Education	SCIENCE & EDUCATION			English	Article							NEXT-GENERATION; EVO-DEVO; CONSTRUCTION; COMPLEXITY; EVOLUTION; GENETICS; GENES; CELL	Genes are often described by biologists using metaphors derived from computational science: they are thought of as carriers of information, as being the equivalent of "blueprints" for the construction of organisms. Likewise, cells are often characterized as "factories" and organisms themselves become analogous to machines. Accordingly, when the human genome project was initially announced, the promise was that we would soon know how a human being is made, just as we know how to make airplanes and buildings. Importantly, modern proponents of Intelligent Design, the latest version of creationism, have exploited biologists' use of the language of information and blueprints to make their spurious case, based on pseudoscientific concepts such as "irreducible complexity" and on flawed analogies between living cells and mechanical factories. However, the living organism = machine analogy was criticized already by David Hume in his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. In line with Hume's criticism, over the past several years a more nuanced and accurate understanding of what genes are and how they operate has emerged, ironically in part from the work of computational scientists who take biology, and in particular developmental biology, more seriously than some biologists seem to do. In this article we connect Hume's original criticism of the living organism = machine analogy with the modern ID movement, and illustrate how the use of misleading and outdated metaphors in science can play into the hands of pseudoscientists. Thus, we argue that dropping the blueprint and similar metaphors will improve both the science of biology and its understanding by the general public.

J	Luo, XX; Wang, LL				Luo, Xiaoxiao; Wang, Lili			FINE ART CREATION AND PHILOSOPHICAL CONSCIOUSNESS THINKING	EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION			English	Article						Philosophical; Consciousness; Art; Creation; Thinking	DESIGN THINKING	This article proposes a speculation of the basic activity of the brain alluded to as the Data Elements of Thinking. This hypothesis is intended to be carried out computationally and afterward exposed to exact testing. It depends on Shannon's data hypothesis and treats the psyche/cerebrum as a data handling organ that intends to be data effective. This implies that it predicts its reality to utilize data proficiently and routinely re-addresses it to effectively store data. In other words, it tries to maximise its information efficiency. The theory is discussed within the framework of a background examination of a number of different research fields that had an influence on its evolution. The discussion then turns to the implications of the theory as well as the observable hypotheses that can be derived from it. Since the beginning of time, one of the fundamental concerns of philosophers has been the phenomena of art. This has been the case ever since the early periods. Along with how and under what conditions the process of creation is occurring and the reason why people require it, it is also the reason for people's sympathy and the meanings that are sent by the process. Persons who have been assigned to it, which usually manages to get people's attention. The focus of attention has also been brought to this phenomenon. of other philosophers who have come after Plato, and the philosophers themselves had also stated a variety of ideas regarding this subject.

It is thus essential that all students learn to critically read newspaper/Internet science. I have adapted the CREATE approach, an active-learning method originally designed for close reading of journal articles (Hoskins et al., 2007), for use with a newspaper article written for the general public. The analysis challenges students to read closely, learn to represent data and design experiments, and think creatively about scientific issues and their social implications. The approaches outlined here can be adapted to any scientific reading and analysis.

Over the last few decades, several tools have been proposed for the development of computational thinking skills; however, there is no area of study that evaluates the implications or the impact that these types of platforms have on users belonging to any knowledge area. Research Question: Do user interfaces influence the development of computational thinking skills? Methodology: To address this issue, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology for analyzing and evaluating scientific publications. Findings: The results show that despite the dearth of literature on the subject, the specific design of a user interface has a significant impact on the development of computational thinking. Bearing the above in mind, it is necessary to conduct research that delves more deeply into the effects caused by the technologies that are used to develop computational thinking, this being a line of research that is worthy of consideration.

J	Padrón, NP; Planchart, SF; Reina, MF				Polanco Padron, Norailith; Ferrer Planchart, Sonia; Fernandez Reina, Mariana			Approach to a definition of computational thinking	RIED-REVISTA IBEROAMERICANA DE EDUCACION A DISTANCIA			Spanish	Article						education; training; elementary school; computational thinking; cognitive processes		The aim of this research revolves around a term that has become popular over the years and whose origins took place from the technical perspective of computer science in order to automate information or the production of systems. However, nowadays it is widely used by many professionals from several areas and groups that are interested in understanding and adopting a different way of thinking and assuming life situations. This concept is called Computational Thinking. This research pursues the objective of contributing to the construction of a definition on computational thinking, as well as to the use of this term for educational purposes. The research is descriptive with a documentary design, based on the review of literature related to the subject, in order to properly specify how computational thinking is seen as an option for the representation, acquisition of knowledge and attention to problems, from the viewpoint of experts as ISTE & CSTA (2011), Papert (1980), Garcia-Pefialvo (2016), Wing (2006), among others. It was found that a definition by consensus of computational thinking has been the subject of constant debate within the scientific community, and one of the best options surrounding this kind of thinking is its incorporation into the mandatory school curriculum, from early stages or levels of the educational system, in order to enhance the children's analytical skills through the application of computer principles.

Based on the needs in computing courses and the necessity to build up students' regular learning habits in online learning environments, the author in this study integrated design thinking (DT) with co-regulated learning (CRL) to develop students' computing skills, and conducted a quasi-experiment to examine the effects of DT and CRL. The participants in this study were 153 undergraduates from three classes taking a compulsory course entitled 'Applied Information Technology: Data Processing.' The first class (DT and CRL group) simultaneously received the intervention of web-mediated DT and CRL, the second class (CRL group) received the intervention of web-mediated CRL, and the last group (control group) received the traditional teaching method, although teaching was conducted in a blended class. Based on the analysis carried out in this study, students who received the intervention of web-mediated DT had significantly better computing skills in using Excel than those without. In addition, web-mediated CRL also contributed to significantly better development of computing skills. The author expects that this study could provide insights into the design of web-mediated DT and CRL for teachers, educators, and schools.

However, there is little empirical evidence so far as to whether this is actually the case. This paper presents the results of a systematic review of international studies that compare the critical thinking of Chinese students with students of other nationalities. A search of eight social science databases supplemented by other sources found 15 studies that met pre-specified inclusion criteria. Nine of these focused on students' critical thinking skills, but their results were mixed. There is no evidence to support the claim that Chinese students have higher or lower critical thinking skills than other students. The research in this area is weak. Five studies on critical thinking dispositions suggest that Chinese students were less disposed to critical thinking, which is not the same as being weak in critical thinking. Only one study was about critical thinking style, indicating that Chinese students perfer information-seeking to engaging in critical thinking. Almost all studies were small-scale using weak designs. These findings suggest that the critical thinking of Chinese students is under-studied, and therefore, more robust, larger-scale experimental studies are needed.

Retrieval Practices Enhance Computational and Scientific Thinking Skills	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						retrieval practices; computational thinking; scientific thinking; inductive reasoning; deductive reasoning	SCIENCE; K-12	The notion of teaching experts' habits of mind (e.g., computational thinking and scientific thinking) to novices seems to have inspired many educators and researchers worldwide. In particular, a great deal of efforts has been invested in computational thinking (CT) and its manifestations in different fields. However, there remain some troubling spots in CT education as far as how to teach it at different levels of education. The same argument applies to teaching scientific thinking (ST) skills. A remedy has been suggested to narrow CT and ST skillsets down to core cognitive competencies so they can be introduced in early and middle grades and continue to be nurtured during secondary and post-secondary years. Neuroscientists suggest that the act of (computational) thinking is strongly linked to the acts of information storage/retrieval by our brain. Plus, years of research have shown that retrieval practices promote not only knowledge retention but also inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning. Not surprisingly, these reasoning skills are core elements of both CT and ST skillsets. This article will mesh the findings of a teacher professional development with the existing literature to lay a claim that retrieval practices enhance CT and ST skills. The study offered training to secondary school teachers (n = 275) who conducted classroom action research to measure the impact of retrieval practices on teaching and learning of STEM and CT concepts. We used a quasi-experimental research design with purposeful sampling and a sequential mixed-methods approach focusing on the impact of professional development on teacher outcomes and, in turn, on student outcomes. A survey of teacher participants showed that the majority (96%) of survey respondents (n = 232) reported a good understanding of retrieval strategies, and how relevant ideas can be implemented and tested in the classroom. A large number of action research (target-control) studies by teachers (n = 122) showed that students who learned STEM and CS concepts through retrieval practices consistently scored 5-30% higher than those using the usual blocked practice. In most cases, the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). While the study contributes to retrieval practices literature, those looking for best practices to teach core CT and ST skills should benefit from it the most. The study concludes with some recommendations for future research based on the limitations of its current findings.

In particular, early design decisions can have a very significant impact on sustainability. These decisions not only relate to material and manufacturing choices but have a far-reaching effect on the product's entire life cycle, including transportation, distribution, and end-of-life logistics. However, key challenges have to be overcome to enable eco-design methods to be applicable in early design stages. Lack of information models, semantic interoperability, methods to influence eco-design thinking in early stages, measurement science and uncertainty models in eco-decisions, and ability to balance business decisions and eco-design methodology are serious impediments to realizing sustainable products and services. Therefore, integrating downstream life cycle data into eco-design tools is essential to achieving true sustainable product development. Our review gives an overview of related research and positions early eco-design tools and decision support as a key strategy for the future. By merging sustainable thinking into traditional design methods, this review provides a framework for ongoing research, as well as encourages research collaborations among the various communities interested in sustainable product realization.

Systemic Thinking on Services Science, Management and Engineering: Applications and Challenges in Services Systems Research	IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						Services engineering; services management; services science; services system; SSME; systems theory	QUALITY FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT; RELATIONAL BENEFITS; INFORMATION-SYSTEM; BUSINESS PROCESS; MULTIDISCIPLINARY DESIGN; OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT; ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS; MODEL; TECHNOLOGY; NETWORKS	As the world increasingly becomes characterized by the provision of services to customers, service research faces many challenges and needs a new vision. Many of these challenges stem from the fact that technologies are continually experiencing dramatic change, and savvy customers are increasingly demanding more qualified services. Although research and experiential findings on services in many disciplines have achieved impressive results, systematic research on modern services systems is rarely considered. Aiming at services systems (not only services themselves), this paper discusses the contributions and the potentials for the field of systems theory for Services Science, Management and Engineering (SSME). Thus, SSME can provide suitable referential clues for discussing impacts of systems theory on services research, and systemic thinking can be applied to discuss key issues in SSME. Providing basic definitions of services and services systems, this paper elaborates on the research objects and methodologies of SSME from systems perspective, and proposes that systems theory can be applied as the foundations of services engineering. This paper further sheds light on systemic issues in services science and engineering, services operations, and services systems management. It also provides a summary of relevant theories and tools applied to services systems at the systems level. Finally, some potential prospects in SSME research are presented to meet research demands and practical challenges.

We report on a laboratory study (N = 32) that investigated the effects of task complexity on the types of information used by participants while searching. Participants completed tasks of four complexity levels and had access to four different types of information provided through a search-assistance tool referred to as the InfoBoxes (IB). The IB tool presented the following types of task-related information (info-types) on different tabs: (1) facts, (2) concepts, (3) opinions, and (4) insights. Facts (and opinions) were defined as objective (and subjective) statements relevant to the task. Concepts were defined as important ideas, principles, or entities related to the task. Insights were defined as tips or advice about the task. The study investigated six research questions that considered the effects of task complexity on: (RQ1) participants' pre-/post-task perceptions about useful info-types; (RQ2) use of different info-types during the task; (RQ3) motivations for engaging with the IB; (RQ4) gains from using it; (RQ5) the search stage participants were in while engaging with the IB; and (RQ6) motivations for sometimes avoiding the IB. Our results suggest that task complexity influenced all six types of outcomes. We discuss implications of our results for designing search assistance tools and systems that favor certain types of content based on task characteristics.

However, access to ICT resources and the capacity to use them in global health research remains limited among developing country faculty members. In order to address the global health needs and to design an ICT-related training course, we herein explored the Chinese health science faculty members' perceptions and learning needs for ICT use. Methods: Nine focus groups discussions (FGDs) were conducted during December 2015 to March 2016, involving 63 faculty members working in areas of health sciences from six universities in China. All FGDs were audio recorded and analysed thematically. Results: The findings suggest that the understandings of ICT were not clear among many researchers; some thought that the concept of ICT was too wide and ambiguous. Most participants were able to cite examples of ICT application in their research and teaching activities. Positive attitudes and high needs of ICT use and training were common among most participants. Recommendations for ICT training included customised training programmes focusing on a specific specialty, maintaining a balance between theories and practical applications, more emphasis on the application of ICT, and skills in finding the required information from the bulk information available in the internet. Suggestions regarding the format and offering of training included short training programmes, flexible timing, lectures with practicum opportunities, and free of charge or with very minimal cost to the participants. Two participants suggested the linking of ICT-related training courses with faculty members' year-end assessment and promotion. Conclusions: This study among health sciences faculty members in China demonstrated a high level of need and interest in learning about ICT use in research and training. The results have important implications for the design and implementation of ICT-related educational programmes in China and other developing countries.

Unfortunately, many students focus more on rote memorization than on a conceptual understanding of histologic principles. A strategy to promote conceptualization and critical thinking was tested over three course offerings of a senior/graduate-level Animal Histology course at Clemson University. Students were asked to either "reverse engineer" randomly selected but somewhat esoteric animal organs (e.g., spider silk glands, squid ink glands), or to hypothesize on histologic features of alien or fictional anatomy from popular cinematic productions (Star Wars, Spiderman, etc.). In both cases, students were given very limited starting information (e.g., the alien has blue skin and comes from a very dry planet) and asked to speculate on histologic structures. Overall, students were very engaged in the exercises and reported a high degree of satisfaction, appreciation, and learning. When real-world examples were used (e.g., spider glands), students were somewhat frustrated if confirming information was not readily available in the online literature. In the more abstract circumstances, the students seemed to focus more on the conceptual framework and logical premise behind each feature of imagined alien histology because they knew that no real answers would be available to confirm their hypotheses. Implementation in the classroom included active participation, group work, and individual decision making and rationalization. Exercises that promote the development of critical thinking skills may have utility well beyond the next histology exam and could serve as useful models for additional subjects, including anatomy, physiology, and others.

Implementing adequate online pedagogical approaches and integrating different digital tools in the teaching process have become a priority in educational systems. Finding a way to keep students' interest and persistence in learning is an important issue that online education is facing. One possible way to establish engaging and interactive learning environments, using the energy and enthusiasm of students for educational purposes, is the use of game-based learning activities and gamification of different parts of the educational process. Objective: This paper presents a use case of migrating an escape room-style educational game to an online environment by using the design thinking methodology. We wanted to show that the design thinking methodology is useful to create engaging and motivating online games that provide educational value. Methods: Starting from students' perspective, we created a simple digital escape room-style game where students got an opportunity to self-assess their knowledge in computer science at their own pace. Students tested this prototype game, and their opinions about the game were collected through an online survey. The test's goal was to evaluate the students' perceptions about the implemented digital escape room-style educational game and gather information about whether it could achieve students' engagement in learning computer science during online teaching. Results: In total, 117 students from sixth and seventh grades completed the survey regarding the achieved student engagement. Despite the differences in students' answers about game complexity and puzzle difficulty, most students liked the activity (mean 4.75, SD 0.67, on a scale from 1 to 5). They enjoyed the game, and they would like to participate in this kind of activity again (mean 4.74, SD 0.68). All (n=117, 100%) students found the digital escape room-style educational game interesting for playing and learning. Conclusions: The results confirmed that digital escape room-style games could be used as an educational tool to engage students in the learning process and achieve learning outcomes. Furthermore, the design thinking methodology proved to be a useful tool in the process of adding novel educational value to the digital escape room-style game.

These skills serve as the foundation of not only introductory courses but also the entire psychology curriculum. In this article, we address why these skills are critical to help students interpret information and assess claims and review the current practice of measuring student reasoning in this domain. The reach of Goal 2 is broad, including the application of scientific reasoning to interpret psychological phenomena, the demonstration of psychology information literacy, the interpretation and execution of basic psychological research, and an understanding of sociocultural influences in scientific inquiry. We discuss the value of both formative and summative assessments in this area, offer examples of assessment tools currently in use, and provide a list of nationally normed assessments in critical thinking and scientific reasoning. We conclude with a discussion of limitations in current assessment practices and suggest possible future directions.

Moreover it is an important crop because of its high content of beta-carotene, well-known as the precursor of vitamin A carotenoid. However, seed-hair which is generated in epidermal cell of seeds inhibits absorption and germination. For that reason, carrot seeds are commercialized after mechanical hair removal process. To overcome such cumbersome weaknesses, new breeding program for developing hairless-seed carrot cultivar has been needed. Therefore, in this study, cDNA libraries from seeds of short-hair seed phenotype CT-ATR615 OP 666-13line and hairy seed CT-ATR615 OP-CK1-9 line were constructed and expression patterns related to generation of seed-hair were analyzed by comparison of EST sequences. Differential EST sequence results between two lines were classified into FunCat functional categories based on the results of BlastX search. Higher expression quantities belonging to metabolic category were shown on short-hair seed line than hairy-seed one. Differential expression quantities between those two lines in the protein folding and stabilization, subcellular localization categories were supposed to contribute variously on the generation of seed-hair. We confirmed 50 and 59 SSR sites, and 2 SNP sites by analyzing EST sequences in two lines; thereafter, we designed SNP and SSR primer sets from these EST sequence information as a molecular marker. These markers are thought to be used in research of molecular markers for classification of carrot family and related to various traits, as well as seed-hair characteristic.

J	Garfield, E				Garfield, E			Random thoughts on citationology. Its theory and practice - Comments on theories of citation?	SCIENTOMETRICS			English	Article								Theories of citation are as elusive as theories of information science, which have been debated for decades. But as a basis for discussion I offer the term citationology as the theory and practice of citation, including its derivative disciplines citation analysis and bibliometrics. Several maxims, commandments if you will, have been enunciated. References are the result of a specialized symbolic language with a citation syntax and grammar. References, like words, have multiple meanings which are related to the aposteriori quality of citation indexes. Therefore, citation relevance cannot be predicted. Mathematical microtheories in bibliometrics abound, including the apposite laws of scattering and concentration. Citation behavior is a vast sub-set of citation theory, which like citation typology, can never be complete. Deviant citation behavior preoccupies certain authors but it is rarely significant in well-designed citation analyses, where proper cohorts are defined. Myths about uncitedness and the determinants of impact are discussed, as well as journal impact factors as surrogates and observation's on scientists of Nobel Class. After two years at Johns Hopkins investigating "machine documentation," and another year as a student of library science, I became, fortuitously, a documentation consultant. By 1954, I called myself an information engineer, which was an apt description of my professional consulting activities. However, Pennsylvania licensing law requires that engineers be graduates of engineering schools. So I became an information scientist! I've never thought of myself as an information theoretician and have been skeptical about a need for a theory of information science. I've practiced information science and engineering without explicit theoretical support. But undoubtedly there are underlying principles which can guide information scientists who, like myself, could be called "citationists" or "citationologists.'' If there is a theory and practice of citation, it should probably be called citationology.

Developing an Engineering Design Process Assessment Using Think-Aloud Interviews	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						engineering design process; assessment; validation; cognitive interviews		Early exposure to engineering has been found to help students in their decision-making regarding engineering education and career pathways. Subsequently, an NSF-funded project is underway that is focused on development of an engineering curriculum for students in grades six through nine. The Engineering Design Process (EDP) frames this curriculum. The current study presents the validation methods and results of a multiple-choice assessment created to measure students' understanding of the EDP. The utilization of Think Aloud Interviews and the application and analysis of qualitative coding schemes for the purpose of systematically gathering evidence about the psychometric quality of the assessment are described. Findings from this study support the validity of the EDP assessment through evidence of alignment between the intended skills and the skills elicited in the student interviews.

It does so by addressing issues such as the processes related to comprehension of medical information, clinical problem-solving and decision-making, and the role of technology. This paper reviews these theories and methods from the cognitive and learning sciences and their role in addressing current and future needs in designing curricula, largely using illustrative examples drawn from medical education. The lessons of this past work are also applicable, however, to biomedical and health professional curricula in general, and to biomedical informatics training, in particular. We summarize empirical studies conducted over two decades on the role of memory, knowledge organization and reasoning as well as studies of problem-solving and decision-making in medical areas that inform curricular design. The results of this research contribute to the design of more informed curricula based on empirical findings about how people learn and think, and more specifically, how expertise is developed. Similarly, the study of practice can also help to shape theories of human performance, technology-based learning, and scientific and professional collaboration that extend beyond the domain of medicine. just as biomedical science has revolutionized health care practice, research in the cognitive and learning sciences provides a scientific foundation for education in biomedicine. the health professions, and biomedical informatics.

In this work, we aimed at designing a learning environment with the objective of equipping students with skills that allow them to deal with socio-scientific issues (SSI) in an infodemic context. To this end, we proposed an educational innovation through design-based research, which was oriented to the treatment of information disseminated in the media and social networks related to COVID-19. We divided this information into four major constructs: virus and disease dynamics; pandemic and environmental crisis; hygiene and protocols; and vaccines, potential solutions, and pharmaceutical industry. On the basis of the activities of the didactic sequence, which included class discussion, interviews with the immediate environment, audiovisual productions, and a final plenary, we identified criteria that students applied to trust or not trust the circulating information and a series of strategies to corroborate the information. In addition, framing COVID-19 as an SSI allowed the discussion of curricular content in science and on sociocultural dimensions that cross the pandemic. Based on the implementation of the teaching-learning sequence, we conclude that the proposed activities favored reflection on critical thinking and awareness of the responsibilities they have as potential disseminators and/or generators of information.

Computational Thinking in Elementary and Secondary Teacher Education	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION			English	Article						Experimentation; Measurement; Computational thinking; teacher education; teaching/learning strategies		Computational thinking (CT) is broadly defined as the mental activity for abstracting problems and formulating solutions that can be automated. In an increasingly information-based society, CT is becoming an essential skill for everyone. To ensure that students develop this ability at the K-12 level, it is important to provide teachers with an adequate knowledge about CT and how to incorporate it into their teaching. This article describes a study on designing and introducing computational thinking modules and assessing their impact on preservice teachers' understanding of CT concepts, as well as their attitude towards computing. Results demonstrate that introducing computational thinking into education courses can effectively influence preservice teachers' understanding of CT concepts.

Scientific information literacy, attitude and persuasiveness in decision making among Nigerian university students	INFORMATION DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						decision making; information use; science attitude; scientific literacy; university students	ACCEPTANCE	Acceptance and and use of scientific findings have been reported to face challenges that are attributable to inadequacies of science and/or society's inadequate scientific literacy and attitude. In view of the dearth of studies on these issues in Nigeria, this study explored the levels and variations in the scientific literacy, attitude to science, and persuasiveness of scientific compared to cultural knowledge in some personal decision making contexts of postgraduate students in a Nigerian university. The study collected data through a designed and validated questionnaire administered on 315 postgraduate students in the University of Ibadan, Nigeria. Findings among others are that attitude to science was very highly positive, religious information had slightly stronger persuasiveness in decision making for the students than scientific information, and much more than cultural information. Knowledge of scientific methodology, and critical thinking behavior have positive influence on students' persuasiveness of science while cultural belief has negative predictive influence on their persuasiveness of science. The study concludes, amongst others, that students' attitude to science and their persuasiveness of science can be influenced by their levels of knowledge of science methodology and cultural belief, though in an opposing manner. This implies that publics' understandanding of the persuasiveness of science could be improved by variations in their levels of knowledge of science methodology and cultural belief, amongst other variables. The study therefore, recommends that scientists should begin to communicate science methods to the public through public-friendly and informal means while also subjecting some of the cultural beliefs to scientific tests and communicating their outcomes to the public.

Furthermore, the paper aims to construct the knowledge space based on makers' knowledge demand. Design/methodology/approach The first step of this research is to explore the makers' knowledge demand by the methods of field investigation, non-interventional study and in-depth interviews. On that basis, the elements, principles, framework and mechanism of the knowledge space were discussed. The grounded theory and NVivo software were used in the data analysis. Findings The investigation shows that interest and competition are the main motivations for makers' knowledge demand. The findings also indicate that the characteristics are active knowledge needs, "informal learning" preferences, divergent thinking, close community ties and interdisciplinary. According to the makers' knowledge demand node conceptual model, the content of makers' knowledge demand is principle knowledge, empirical knowledge and knowledge situation. Based on the above findings, the elements, principles, operation framework and inherent operation mechanism of the knowledge space construction are systemically described. Originality/value This study gives precise details about makers' knowledge demand and the construction of makers' knowledge space by libraries. This is the first research that comprehensively explores the knowledge demand of makers. The findings can help the library plan and implement the construction of makerspace, and also improve the service for makers.

This assessment is part of a larger study aimed at developing a CT-based curriculum framework for an undergraduate nursing educational program in a developing country. Design: A quantitative descriptive cross-sectional design was used to assess the CT disposition of undergraduate nursing students. This cross-sectional study identified strengths and weaknesses of nursing students relative to critical thinking mindset. Methods: The California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI) was used to assess the CT disposition of 112 undergraduate nursing students from March to May 2018. The CCTDI contains 75 items of six-point Likert scale of seven subscales. Data were analyzed through the use of descriptive statistics, the independent t-test and ANOVA. Results: Most participants (73%) demonstrated a positive inclination towards critical thinking on the overall CCTDI score. Students' mean score was highest on the confidence in reasoning subscale while lowest on truthseeking. A statistically significant difference (p = 0.03) was found in the years of study on the inquisitiveness subscale. Conclusions: These findings indicate the need for educators to devise strategies to assist students to seek accurate information building on students' positive CT disposition.

After a three-step filtering process, 28 empirical studies on the effectiveness of the instructional strategies were analysed, following PICOS methodology. The analysis tackled the type of strategy, methods and outcomes, the research design, and assessment tools used. Diverse instructional designs, different in length, were used with variable success when compared with traditional lecturing. Several limitations were found, such as insufficient information regarding the intervention design and the alignment between learning outcomes and the assessment instruments. Due to the variability in sample sizes and research designs, it is difficult to conclude on the effectiveness of particular instructional strategies. Researchers ought to recognize the concerns herein discussed when designing, implementing and assessing future interventions.

Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical framework is formulated and propositions are postulated involving independent, mediating, moderating and dependent variables. Findings - This paper recommends a helpful framework for understanding of how counterfactual thinking affects information searching, sharing and decision-making accuracy in groups, thereby preventing catastrophes. Practical/implications - The proposed framework might be of assistance in managing complex group decision-making and information sharing in organizations. Decision-makers may become aware that activating counterfactual mind-set enables them to search for critical information facilitating accurate decision-making in groups leading to catastrophe prevention. Originality/value - This paper adds value to the field of counterfactual thinking theory applied to group decision-making. Moreover, the paper provides a novel framework for group decision-making which sheds light on pertinent variables, which can either ameliorate or exacerbate the accuracy of decision-making by information searching and sharing in groups under varying context of high/low task complexity. The ramifications of task conflict, conflict management mechanisms, team diversity and size are explored alongside the moderating role of cognitive complexity, cognitive closure and tolerance for ambiguity.

As such, an increasing number of bachelor's and master's programs outside of the CS discipline integrate CT courses within their study program. At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics. Our findings suggest that, in the process of learning CT for non-CS students, engagement in active learning activities can be a stronger determinant of learning outcomes than initial knowledge. Furthermore, gamifying computational notebooks can serve as a strong driver of active learning engagement, even more so than initial motivational factors.

However, the existing curricula do not have adequate emphasis on global health research and training. This study was carried out to examine health sciences postgraduates' attitudes and practices regarding curriculum for ICT use in global health research and training in China. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among health sciences postgraduates from six universities in southern China, during December 2016 to March 2017. A self-administered online questionnaire was used to collect data through an online survey platform. Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows 13.0. Results: A total of 1065 participants successfully completed the questionnaires. More than 90% of the students have not had any training about ICT, three quarters have not taken an online course, and 31% of the students do not use ICT in their current research. More than 65% thought that, in an ICT research training curriculum, it was important to learn: ICT utilization related knowledge, ICT research methods/resources, knowledge of databases, ways of data use and acquisition, and informatics search methods (ICT users compared to non-users were more likely to agree to these learning components (all p < 0.05)). Many of the respondents used or planned to use mobile phones (80%), Internet (59%), use computer and WeChat (> 40%), and QQ (a popular chat tool in China) (30%) as ICT tools in research activities. ICT users compared to non-users were more likely to consider using ICT and/or biomedical informatics methods in decision-support or support for information seeking, healthcare delivering, academic research, data gathering, and facilitating collaboration (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: The findings of this study showed that ICT utilization was very important to health sciences postgraduates for their research activities in China, but they lacked ICT-related training. The results suggested the need for specialized curriculum related to ICT use in global health research for health sciences postgraduates in China.

J	Tsai, MJ; Wu, AH				Tsai, Meng-Jung; Wu, An-Hsuan			Visual search patterns, information selection strategies, and information anxiety for online information problem solving	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Data science applications in education; Human computer interaction; Information literacy; Eye-tracking; Teaching/learning strategies	EYE-TRACKING; SEDUCTIVE DETAILS; EMOTIONAL DESIGN; SCIENCE; STUDENTS; MOVEMENTS; PERSPECTIVES; TECHNOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK	Online information problem solving (DIPS) is essential for 21st century information literacy which often requires information selection competencies. However, students usually have problems in discriminating information from complex web sources. This study, utilizing eye-tracking technology, aims to examine the relationships among learners' visual search patterns, information anxiety and OIPS task performance in web search contexts. In this study, 46 university students volunteered to participate in a web search task for solving a landslide problem. Student' visual behaviors were recorded by eye-trackers during the task and information anxiety was self-reported immediately after the task. Reaction time and task performance were also recorded and scored. Pearson's correlation analyses, multiple regression analyses, cluster analyses and lag sequential analyses (LSA) were conducted. The results show that learners' eye-tracking measures, information anxiety, and task performances are significantly correlated in OIPS. Students' visual attention paid onto irrelevant web information can significantly and positively predicts their information anxiety, but negatively predicts their task performance. Additionally, based on eye-tracking measures and reaction time, three visual search patterns are identified: Confused, Slow-thinking and Fast-thinking. The LSA results further show that different information selection and attentional control strategies are utilized by different groups, especially when discriminating the relevancy of web information. This study bridges the associations among eye-tracking measures, information anxiety and task performances in OIPS contexts. Future studies are suggested to analyze eye-tracking data using cluster analyses plus LSAs to profile online learners' characteristics in terms of visual search or information processing patterns.

J	Hall, P				Hall, Peter			Disorderly Reasoning in Information Design	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								The importance of information visualization as a means of transforming data into visual, understandable form is now embraced across university campuses and research institutes world-wide. Yet, the role of designers in this field of activity is often overlooked by the dominant scientific and technological interests in data visualization, and a corporate culture reliant on off-the-shelf visualization tools. This article is an attempt to describe the value of design thinking in information visualization with reference to Horst Rittel's (1988) definition of "disorderly reasoning," and to frame design as a critical act of translating between scientific, technical, and aesthetic interests.

It mainly includes enabling technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems (CPS), cloud computing, industrial integration, industrial information integration, and other technologies. Systems science has been emerged and well developed since the second half of the twentieth century. From 1940s until now, systems science has been called systems science, systems engineering, systems theory, cybernetics, systems analysis, systems methodology, systems approach, and systems thinking. Since its emergence, a wealth of research has produced an astonishing array of theoretical results and empirical insights, and a large suite of methods and techniques. Systems science has been continuously, widely, and successfully applied to many subjects in natural science and social sciences. This paper aims at discussing the potential contribution of systems science to Industry 4.0. As we approach the era of Fourth Industrial Revolution, this paper points out that systems science is a necessity to deal with the overwhelming systems complexity in Industry 4.0 and the surrounding industrial ecosystem.

J	Haupt, G				Haupt, Grietjie			Hierarchical thinking: a cognitive tool for guiding coherent decision making in design problem solving	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN EDUCATION			English	Article						Design cognition; Decision making; Hierarchical thinking; 4-Level decision making tool; Problem solving; Intentions; Multi-directional transformation	JUDGMENT; INSTRUCTION; TECHNOLOGY	This paper builds on two concepts, the first of which is the extended information processing model of expert design cognition. This proposes twelve internal psychological characteristics interacting with the external world of expert designers during the early phases of the design process. Here, I explore one of the characteristics, hierarchical abstraction, and adapt it into an alternative ontological model of decision making. The model serves as an in-depth descriptor of how designers from different domains transform their mental states using judgment and decision making through hierarchical abstraction. The second concept entails an expansion of the idea of synergistic vertical transformation as a framework for mapping expert designers' design process. Here, I focus on hierarchical decision making as multi-directional, and inter-relating the internal and external world of designers. In doing so, I provide a coding tool for researchers interested in exploring designers' complex decision making processes. Concurrently, the model serves as decision making tool in design and technology education classrooms. As such, the paper focuses on the ontology of conceptual structures that support the early phases of the design process. This was based on empirical research.

Information systems as a nexus of information technology systems: A new view of information systems practice	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Information systems; information systems management; information systems practice; systems thinking; information technology; information technology system	DESIGN SCIENCE; PRINCIPLES; ARTIFACT; PLATFORM	The close relationship between the concepts of information systems and information technology creates issues for researchers. Usefully distinguishing between the concepts is problematic. We investigate the use of the systems concept in practice, finding a pragmatic distinction between an information system (IS) and an information technology system (IT system). In a practice view, an IS incorporates an emphasis on both a technical and a social subsystem, while an IT system predominantly emphasizes the technical elements. This distinction becomes useful in practice because contemporary IS practitioners are often involved in acquiring and integrating IT systems into an organizational IS. This involvement leads to a viewpoint on the organizational IS (including the social subsystem) as a nexus of multiple IT systems. This nexus creates issues in practice for not only integrating IT systems into the organizational IS, but also integrating multiple IT systems with each other in the context of the organizational IS. These issues lead to research opportunities such as the need for new methodologies for IT system acquisitions and new theories that accommodate the social integration of IT systems and IS.

Expanding interest in implementing a game-based approach in computer science education highlights the need for a comprehensive overview of the literature research. This scoping review aims to provide insight into current trends and identify research gaps and potential research topics concerning game-based learning in computer science. Using standard methodology for scoping review, we identified 113 articles from four digital libraries published between 2017 and 2021. Those articles were analyzed concerning the educational level, type of the game, computer science topic covered by the game, pedagogical strategies, and purpose for implementing this approach in different educational levels. The results show that the number of research articles has increased through the years, confirming the importance of implementing a game-based approach in computer science. Different kinds of games, using different technology, concerning different computer science topics are presented in the research. The obtained results indicate that there is no standardized game or standardized methodology that can be used for the creation of an educational game for computer science education. Analyzed articles mainly implement a game-based approach using learning by playing, and no significant focus is given to the effectiveness of learning by designing a game as a pedagogical strategy. Moreover, the approach is mainly implemented for developing computational thinking or programming skills, highlighting the need for its implementation in other topics beyond programming.

This group is presently at a disadvantage when using thesaurus-type schemes in indexes and online search engines because there is a disconnect between how domain novice users of IR systems represent a topic space and how this space is represented in the standard IR system thesaurus. The study attempted to (a) ascertain the coding language used by the 80 undergraduates in the study to mentally represent their topic and then (b) align the mental models with the hierarchical structure found in many thesauri. The intervention focused the undergraduates' thinking about their topic from a topic statement to a thesis statement. The undergraduates were asked to produce three mental model diagrams for their real-life course essay at the beginning, middle, and end of the interview, for a total of 240 mental model diagrams, from which we created a 12-category mental model classification scheme. Findings indicate that at the end of the intervention, (a) the percentage of vertical mental models increased from 24 to 35% of all mental models; but that (b) 3rd-year students had fewer vertical mental models than did 1st-year undergraduates in the study, which is counterintuitive. The results indicate that there is justification for pursuing our research based on the hypothesis that rotating a domain novice's mental model into a vertical position would make it easier for him or her to cognitively connect with the thesaurus's hierarchical representation of the topic area.

Characteristics of IT artifacts: a systems thinking-based framework for delineating and theorizing IT artifacts	INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						IT artifact; systems thinking; systems characteristics; information systems research	ACHIEVING BUSINESS BENEFITS; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS; IDENTITY CRISIS; DESIGN SCIENCE; ERP IMPLEMENTATION; TECHNOLOGY; SOFTWARE; IMPACT; COMPLEXITY	The information technology artifact (ITA) has been suggested as the core of information systems (IS) research, and the research community has been encouraged to deeply engage with the ITA. Various studies highlight, however, that the ITA continues to receive only limited attention and thus, little foundation exists for IS researchers to delineate and theorize about the ITAs studied. In this paper, we develop a framework that can be utilized as a language for articulating and theorizing the ITA in IS research. Our framework builds on the multi-faceted theoretical paradigm of systems thinking from which we derive several concepts and appropriate them to the context at hand, resulting in a seven-dimensional framework of characteristics for ITAs. In a literature survey of research on enterprise systems and enterprise resource planning systems in top IS journals, we show how ITA characteristics are currently included to present details of the relevant ITA instance and identify theoretical relationships between ITA characteristics and outcomes. We conclude the study by demonstrating the use of the ITA framework for delineating and theorizing the ITA in IS research.

J	Wannapiroon, N; Pimdee, P				Wannapiroon, Naphong; Pimdee, Paitoon			Thai undergraduate science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM) creative thinking and innovation skill development: a conceptual model using a digital virtual classroom learning environment	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						21st Century education; Creative Thinking; Critical thinking; Digital Learning Environment; Gamification; Innovation skills; STEAM-ification; STEM; Thailand	LITERACY SKILLS; GAMIFICATION; CLOUD; UNIVERSITY	Qualitative and quantitative research methods were undertaken to examine and develop a digitally based virtual classroom learning environment (VCLE) for Thai undergraduate students' creative thinking and innovation enhancement in science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEM/STEAM) disciplines. The research methodology was divided into two phases, including the synthesis and then the design of the VCLE. Also, in addition to the study's authors, nine experts were used for the model's development and another ten for its assessment (19 total). From their in-depth interviews and subsequent content analysis, their input of the proposed STEAM-ification process was synthesized and the data analyzed. The results revealed that the VCLE design should begin with a face-to-face, classroom learning environment in which the `gamification' mechanisms were introduced and examined. This was then reinforced by moving the gamification process online outside of the classroom. Furthermore, five VCLE STEAM-ification steps were found to be particularly useful for enhancing creative thinking and student innovation. These included investigation, discovery, connections, creativity, and reflection. Moreover, we identified the gamification process as consisting of three main components. These were the 'game mechanics,' the 'game dynamics,' and `player emotions'. The ten experts agreed that the VCLE STEAM-ification creativity and innovation (C & I) process was appropriate at an `excellent' level ((x) over bar = 4.68, S. D. = 0.47), which has great potential in the development of Thai undergraduate student C & I skills. Also, when undertaken correctly, innovation and motivation to learn are also outcomes from both VCLE and gamification applications. Thus, when students undertook study with the VCLE STEAM-ification format, they were found to achieve higher levels of creativity and innovation than students who studied using the traditional teaching plan. These results were found to be statistically significant at the .01 level.

Teaching Critical Thinking via the "Wicked Problem" of Food Insecurity	PORTAL-LIBRARIES AND THE ACADEMY			English	Article							URBAN HEALTH DISPARITIES; INFORMATION LITERACY; STUDENTS; SCIENCE; FACULTY; PROJECT; DESIGN; US	This article describes a project to engage sociology students in real-world research designed to foster critical thinking about food security. Faculty-librarian collaboration was an essential component. An open-ended questionnaire was administered to three classes at the end of the semester. Assessed were students' experiences gathering data and applying abstract concepts and theories to the case study. Students characterized their skill development, identified missing project components, and suggested improvements. These responses were assessed via a rubric to document three types of thinking: dualistic thinking, the belief that the problem has a right and wrong answer; multiplistic thinking, which recognizes uncertainty and multiple viewpoints to the problem; and systemic thinking, which understands the complexity of the problem and how interrelated factors cause it. Results show that the project helped students identify the complex processes and relationships that contribute to food insecurity.

A systematic review of quantitative and qualitative research on the role and effectiveness of written information available to patients about individual medicines	HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT			English	Review							DRUG INFORMATION; PACKAGE INSERTS; MEDICATION INFORMATION; PATIENTS WANT; COMMUNICATING INFORMATION; HEALTH INFORMATION; INFORMING PATIENTS; PRESCRIPTION DRUG; DECISION-MAKING; PRIMARY-CARE	Objectives: To establish the role and value of written information available to patients about individual medicines from the perspective of patients, carers and professionals. To determine how effective this information is in improving patients' knowledge and understanding of treatment and health outcomes. Data sources: Electronic databases searched to late 2004, experts in information design, and stakeholder workshops (including patients and patient organisations). Review methods: Data from selected studies were tabulated and the results were qualitatively synthesised along with findings from the information design and stakeholder workshop strands. Results: Most people do not value the written information they receive. They had concerns about the use of complex language and poor visual presentation and in most cases the research showed that the information did not increase knowledge. The research showed that patients valued written information that was tailored to their individual circumstances and illness, and that contained a balance of harm and benefit information. Most patients wanted to know about any adverse effects that could arise. Patients require information to help decision-making about whether to take a medicine or not and (once taking a medicine) with ongoing decisions about the management of the medicine and interpreting symptoms. Patients did not want written information to be a substitute for spoken information from their prescriber. While not everyone wanted written information, those who did wanted sufficient detail to meet their need. Some health professionals thought that written information for patients should be brief and simple, with concerns about providing side-effect information. They saw increasing compliance as a prime function, in contrast to patients who saw an informed decision not to take a medicine as an acceptable outcome. Conclusions: The combination of a quantitative and qualitative review, an exploration of best practice in information design, plus the input of patients at stakeholder workshops, allowed this review to look at all perspectives. There is a gap between currently provided leaflets and information which patients would value and find more useful. The challenge is to develop methods of provision flexible enough to allow uptake of varying amounts and types of information, depending on needs at different times in an illness. This review has identified a number of areas where future research could be improved in terms of the robustness of its design and conduct, and the use of patient-focused outcomes. The scope for this research includes determining the content, delivery and layout of statutory leaflets that best meet patients' needs, and providing individualised information, which includes both benefit and harm information. In particular, studies of the effectiveness and role and value of Internet-based medicines information are needed.

EEG was recorded with 19 electrodes (10/20 system against averaged ear lobe signals) while volunteers (n = 42) performed two separate tasks: visualization of an abstract concept and interpretation of a painting. Average spectral parameters such as amplitude, local and interhemispheric coherences were computed for five frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta 1, 2 and 3). Results indicate that the frontal regions are strongly involved during these tasks as evidenced by coherence changes. Changes are also present in temporal, parietal and occipital regions and are discussed in relation to information processing with the frontal regions considering the different cognitive functions required by the tasks.

Organizations may save research expenses, influence future development, and maintain distinctive competency by controlling front-end ideas. To date, several idea management tools have been developed. However, it is unknown to what extent they support the idea management process. Therefore, this scoping review aims to understand the classification of idea management tools and their effectiveness through an overview of the academic literature. Electronic databases (Scopus, ACM Digital Library, Web of Science Core Index, Elsevier ScienceDirect, and SpringerLink) were searched, and a total of 38 journal papers (n = 38) from 2010 to 2020 were retrieved. We identified 30 different types of idea management tools categorized as digital tools (n = 21), guidelines (n = 5), and frameworks (n = 4), and these tools have been utilized by software designers, hardware designers, and stakeholders. The identified tools may support various stages of idea management, such as capturing, generating, implementing, monitoring, refinement, retrieving, selection, and sharing. However, most tools only support a single stage (either capture or generate), and they cannot track the life cycle of the ideas, which may lead to misunderstanding. Therefore, it is essential to develop tools for managing ideas that would allow end users, designers, and other stakeholders to minimize bias in selecting and prioritizing ideas.

Retrieving prior knowledge and experience is an important method of acquiring design information, thus designers' precedents retrieval styles reflect their design thinking. The obvious difference between industrial (ID) and mechanical design (MD) education is well known: ID education focuses on cultivating design thinking abilities, while MD education focuses on cultivating technical abilities. The background discipline influences design thinking methods. This study aims at exploring the similarities and differences between ID and MD students' precedents retrieval styles in the design process. Forty-eight junior and senior undergraduate students participated in a brainstorming experiment using the think-aloud method. Participants' prior knowledge and experience retrieved during brainstorming were coded and the frequency ratios were analyzed. We conclude that ID students are more inclined to extract and apply episodic precedents than MD students. Compared with semantic precedents, episodic precedents have a greater possibility for being applied to the final solution.

The purpose of this study is to empirically confirm/disprove the hypothesis that the tools of an educational environment with innovative technologies contribute to the development of pedagogy students' creativity. For this purpose, a creativity course was designed and implemented. Before and after the course, students were assessed using the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking. Similarities or differences between the control and experimental groups were tested using the chi(2) criterion. After taking a course to develop creative thinking, the situation in both groups changed significantly. The research is of theoretical and practical value for teachers and pedagogy students interested in creative thinking development and/or implementation of digital technologies in the educational process. It also has value for software developers. The effectiveness of implementing technological innovations in the educational process depends on these specialists.

A metasynthesis of the complementarity of culturally responsive and inquiry-based science education in K-12 settings: Implications for advancing equitable science teaching and learning	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING			English	Article						culturally responsive science; culturally relevant science; inquiry-based science; metasynthesis	RELEVANT SCIENCE; PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; SCHOOL SCIENCE; STUDENTS; TEACHERS; ACHIEVEMENT; LITERACY; KNOWLEDGE; IMPACT; PERSPECTIVES	Employing metasynthesis as a method, this study examined 52 empirical articles on culturally relevant and responsive science education in K-12 settings to determine the nature and scope of complementarity between culturally responsive and inquiry-based science practices (i.e., science and engineering practices identified in the National Research Council's Framework for K-12 Science Education). The findings from this study indicate several areas of complementarity. Most often, the inquiry-based practices Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information, Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions, and Developing and Using Models were used to advance culturally responsive instruction and assessment. The use and development of models, in particular, allowed students to explore scientific concepts through families' funds of knowledge and explain content from Western science and Indigenous Knowledge perspectives. Moreover, students frequently Analyzed and Interpreted Data when interrogating science content in sociopolitical consciousness-raising experiences, such as identifying pollution and asthma incidences in an urban area according to neighborhood location. Specific inquiry-based practices were underutilized when advancing culturally responsive science instruction, though. For example, Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking and Engaging in Argument from Evidence were infrequently encountered. However, culturally responsive engineering-related practices were most often connected with these, and thus, represent potential areas for future complementarity, particularly as the United States embraces the Next Generation Science Standards. In considering innovative directions for advancing equitable science education, several possibilities are discussed in light of the findings of this study.(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Conventional systems often operate at the wrong level, indexing words when people think in terms of topics, and returning documents when people want a broader view. As a result, users cannot easily determine what is in a collection, how well a particular topic is covered, or what kinds of queries will provide useful results. We have built a new kind of search engine, Keyphind, that is explicitly designed to support browsing. Automatically extracted keyphrases form the basic unit of both indexing and presentation, allowing users to interact with the collection at the level of topics and subjects rather than words and documents. The keyphrase index also provides a simple mechanism for clustering documents, refining queries, and previewing results. We compared Keyphind to a traditional query engine in a small usability study. Users reported that certain kinds of browsing tasks were much easier with the new interface, indicating that a keyphrase index would be a useful supplement to existing search tools.

Understanding the nature of information seeking behavior in critical care: Implications for the design of health information technology	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Information seeking; Critical care; Distributed cognition; Knowledge organization; Complexity	DECISION-MAKING; KNOWLEDGE; COGNITION; NEEDS; ENVIRONMENTS; ORGANIZATION; QUESTIONS; CONTEXT; DOCTORS; SYSTEM	Objective: Information in critical care environments is distributed across multiple sources, such as paper charts, electronic records, and support personnel. For decision-making tasks, physicians have to seek, gather, filter and organize information from various sources in a timely manner. The objective of this research is to characterize the nature of physicians' information seeking process, and the content and structure of clinical information retrieved during this process. Method: Eight medical intensive care unit physicians provided a verbal think-aloud as they performed a clinical diagnosis task. Verbal descriptions of physicians' activities, sources of information they used, time spent on each information source, and interactions with other clinicians were captured for analysis. The data were analyzed using qualitative and quantitative approaches. Results: We found that the information seeking process was exploratory and iterative and driven by the contextual organization of information. While there was no significant differences between the overall time spent paper or electronic records, there was marginally greater relative information gain (i.e., more unique information retrieved per unit time) from electronic records (t(6) = 1.89, p = 0.1). Additionally, information retrieved from electronic records was at a higher level (i.e., observations and findings) in the knowledge structure than paper records, reflecting differences in the nature of knowledge utilization across resources. Conclusion: A process of local optimization drove the information seeking process: physicians utilized information that maximized their information gain even though it required significantly more cognitive effort. Implications for the design of health information technology solutions that seamlessly integrate information seeking activities within the workflow, such as enriching the clinical information space and supporting efficient clinical reasoning and decision-making, are discussed.

J	Gross, M; Latham, D				Gross, Melissa; Latham, Don			The peritextual literacy framework: Using the functions of peritext to support critical thinking	LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							INFORMATION LITERACY; PARATEXTS; ACKNOWLEDGMENT; CONTEXT; TEXT	The peritextual literacy framework (PLF) is a tool for accessing, evaluating, and comprehending the content of media using elements that frame the body of a work and mediate its content for the user. Paratextual elements are the focus of research in classification, bibliometrics, reader's advisory work, and in studies of authorship and publication. However, paratextual theory is just beginning to be acknowledged in LIS. The PLF closes a gap in paratext theory by categorizing the functions of peritext into six types: production, promotional, navigational, intratextual, supplemental, and documentary. The PLF is unique that it provides both a framework for further research on peritext, as well as a pedagogical tool that supports teaching in the areas of information literacy, media literacy and analysis, critical thinking, reading, and media design and production.

Two classes of third-year undergraduate industrial design students in two collaborating universities in Taiwan-Chang Gung University and National Yunlin University of Science and Technology-participated in an experimental design studio course mediated with an online design learning environment. Surveys and focus group interviews were conducted at the end of the course to record students' attitudes and perceptions. The students thought that the approach used had a positive influence on design teaching and learning and expressed acceptance of using the Internet to support design education. Finally, suggestions were proposed to help design educators in adopting, modifying, and developing systems for using the Internet to mediate design studio courses.

J	Su, KW; Liu, CL				Su, Kuo-Wei; Liu, Cheng-Li			A Mobile Nursing Information System Based on Human-Computer Interaction Design for Improving Quality of Nursing	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Human-computer interaction; Nursing information system; Personal digital assistant; Small-screen interface design	USABILITY; USERS	A conventional Nursing Information System (NIS), which supports the role of nurse in some areas, is typically deployed as an immobile system. However, the traditional information system can't response to patients' conditions in real-time, causing delays on the availability of this information. With the advances of information technology, mobile devices are increasingly being used to extend the human mind's limited capacity to recall and process large numbers of relevant variables and to support information management, general administration, and clinical practice. Unfortunately, there have been few studies about the combination of a well-designed small-screen interface with a personal digital assistant (PDA) in clinical nursing. Some researchers found that user interface design is an important factor in determining the usability and potential use of a mobile system. Therefore, this study proposed a systematic approach to the development of a mobile nursing information system (MNIS) based on Mobile Human-Computer Interaction (M-HCI) for use in clinical nursing. The system combines principles of small-screen interface design with user-specified requirements. In addition, the iconic functions were designed with metaphor concept that will help users learn the system more quickly with less working-memory. An experiment involving learnability testing, thinking aloud and a questionnaire investigation was conducted for evaluating the effect of MNIS on PDA. The results show that the proposed MNIS is good on learning and higher satisfaction on symbol investigation, terminology and system information.

J	Lisec, A; Rosi, B; Kavran, Z				Lisec, Andrej; Rosi, Bojan; Kavran, Zvonko			Holistic thinking aproach: Case study of post network in Slovenia	PROMET-TRAFFIC & TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						systemic thinking; dialectical network thinking; management; logistics; postal services; postal delivery		Modem complexity of management is associated with important decision making, confronting a great number of useless information. Selection of information - the choice of only quality ones, i.e. essential ones, is a big problem in management decision-making. Implementation of systemic approach i.e. dialectical-network thinking (LINT) can help to deal with it. The paper presents a holistic thinking approach in a case study for the Slovenian parcel postal problem. The volume of parcel flows at the Post of Slovenia between Posts is increasing rapidly and it requires a new design of the postal network. This paper presents a reorganization of parcel services between Postal Logistics Centers and Posts by adding Regional Parcel Centers and Parcel Posts to the network. A case for the area covered by Ljubljana Postal Logistics Center is given, which takes into consideration the sorting out and the retaining of parcels in the Posts, Parcel Posts and Regional Parcel Centers within their individual areas.

J	Batooli, Z; Mohamadloo, A; Nadi-Ravandi, S				Batooli, Zahra; Mohamadloo, Azam; Nadi-Ravandi, Somayyeh			Relationship between altmetric and bibliometric indicators across academic social sites in article-level: the case of Iranian researchers' "Top Papers" in clinical medicine	LIBRARY HI TECH			English	Article						Bibliometric indicators; Clinical medicine; Social impact; Top papers; Web of Science (WoS); PlumX; ResearchGate	READERSHIP; CITATIONS; MENDELEY	Purpose The study aimed to measure scientific and social impacts of Iranian researchers' "Top Papers" in clinical medicine using citation and altmetric indicators. Design/methodology/approach In this applied descriptive-analytical study, it used scientometric analysis. A total of 166 "Top Papers" of Iranian researchers in clinical medicine category of Web of Science (WoS) database including "Highly Cited Papers" and "Hot Papers" published between 2009 and 2019 were used. Overall, 29 indicators and their data were extracted from WoS, Scopus, ResearchGate (RG) and PlumX in March 2020. Findings The results showed that there exists a positive correlation between the number of citations in WoS, Scopus, RG, PubMed and Crossref. In addition, it was found that there existed a positive correlation between the received citations by articles and altmetric indicators. According to the results, there is a strong correlation between RG Research Interest and citation impact. The correlation analysis on the Plum Analytics categories including "Usage", "Capture", "Mention", "Social Media" and "Citation" showed the correlations between five dimensions of impact were positive and significant. The results have led the authors to think more about new metrics that can response to new developments in the new information areas. Research limitations/implications There are limitations to access altmetric.com in Iran and cannot be used easily. On the other hand, because of considering 24 indicators, authors had to investigate only a sample of 166 top papers from Iranian researchers to present the detailed results. About nature of altmetric indicators, although they reflect the nonacademic impact of articles alongside bibliographic indicators, they still cannot be a complete representative of the influence of their owners. Practical implications This study can indicate a practical application appropriate for the future study. It would be valuable to further examine how social academic platforms construct images of impact of research and how this impacts the social impact of the university as a mission. This study suggests that social media attention to academic research can be much greater than what is shown in traditional indicators such as citation. Originality/value This study examines 29 indicators from four platforms including RG, WoS, Scopus and PlumX, simultaneously and measures the relationship among them.

The main objectives of this study were to test South African high school Physical Sciences teachers' competence in the cognitive skills and strategies needed for studying Physical Sciences effectively and also to identify possible reasons for their difficulties and suggest methods for overcoming them. The study method used was the analysis of teachers' answers to questions that were carefully designed to test competence in explanation skills, mathematical skills, graphical skills, three-dimensional visualization skills, information-processing skills and reasoning skills. Seventy-three teachers from about 50 Dinaledi schools in the North West and Kwazulu-Natal provinces were tested. Teachers' competence was found to be poor in most of the skills tested. About 40 % (average performance in all 14 test questions) of them had difficulty in answering the questions. Teachers' lack of competence in cognitive skills and strategies would be an important limiting factor in the successful implementation of the Physical Sciences curriculum. An urgent need therefore exists for training teachers to increase their competence in the cognitive skills and strategies that are needed for studying science effectively.

A good level of geospatial thinking is related to academic success in engineering degrees. It is relevant, therefore, to detect the possible deficiencies that university students may have in tasks related to geospatial thinking. This research presents the results of a 20142019 multiyear study with agricultural engineering students, in which seven geospatial tasks were analyzed. The statistical analysis shows that geospatial tasks related to slope, stream/water flow, visibility, and relief interpretation are the best at predicting the final course mark. The present research provides quantitative data on the efficiency that four technologies have to reinforce geospatial thinking focused on each task. Augmented Reality is an appropriate 3D technology for geospatial tasks related to route search, stream/water flow, and elevation points. SketchUp Make 2017 and Autodesk 123D Make showed their potential to solve tasks related to terrain slope and visibility analysis. Spatial Data Infrastructure has given the best results in geospatial tasks related to the photointerpretation of the relief and with topographic profiles of the terrain. Our findings will help teachers to select the most appropriate geospatial tasks to include in their courses.

Uncritical acceptance of these claims can lead to poor, and sometimes dangerous, treatment decisions, and wasted time and money. Resources to help people learn to think critically about treatment claims are scarce, and they are widely scattered. Furthermore, very few learning-resources have been assessed to see if they improve knowledge and behavior. Objectives Our objectives were to develop the Critical thinking and Appraisal Resource Library (CARL). This library was to be in the form of a database containing learning resources for those who are responsible for encouraging critical thinking about treatment claims, and was to be made available online. We wished to include resources for groups we identified as 'intermediaries' of knowledge, i.e. teachers of schoolchildren, undergraduates and graduates, for example those teaching evidence-based medicine, or those communicating treatment claims to the public. In selecting resources, we wished to draw particular attention to those resources that had been formally evaluated, for example, by the creators of the resource or independent research groups. Methods CARL was populated with learning-resources identified from a variety of sources-two previously developed but unmaintained inventories; systematic reviews of learning-interventions; online and database searches; and recommendations by members of the project group and its advisors. The learning-resources in CARL were organised by 'Key Concepts' needed to judge the trustworthiness of treatment claims, and were made available online by the James Lind Initiative in Testing Treatments interactive (TTi) English (www.testingtreatments.org/category/learning-resources). TTi English also incorporated the database of Key Concepts and the Claim Evaluation Tools developed through the Informed Healthcare Choices (IHC) project (informedhealthchoices.org). Results We have created a database of resources called CARL, which currently contains over 500 open-access learning-resources in a variety of formats: text, audio, video, webpages, cartoons, and lesson materials. These are aimed primarily at 'Intermediaries', that is, 'teachers', 'communicators', 'advisors', 'researchers', as well as for independent 'learners'. The resources included in CARL are currently accessible at www. testingtreatments.org/category/learning-resources Conclusions We hope that ready access to CARL will help to promote the critical thinking about treatment claims, needed to help improve healthcare choices.

J	Doi, T				Doi, Toshihisa			Usability Textual Data Analysis: A Formulaic Coding Think-Aloud Protocol Method for Usability Evaluation	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						think-aloud protocol; usability testing; user requirement; SCAT; 70 design items		Think-aloud protocols are among the most standard methods for usability evaluation, which help to discover usability problems and to examine improvements because they provide direct information on a user's thinking and cognitive processes; however, it is often difficult to determine how to analyze the data to identify usability problems because there is no formulaic analysis procedure for textual data. Therefore, the analysis is time-consuming, and the quality of the results varies depending on an analyst's skills. In the present study, the author proposes a formulaic analysis think-aloud protocol method that specifies the procedure for analyzing participants' verbal responses during usability tests. The aim of the proposed think-aloud protocol method was to deliver an explicit procedure using step coding (SCAT) and 70 design items for textual data analysis, and then, the method was applied to a case study of usability evaluation to confirm that the method could extract the target system's problems. By using step coding and 70 design items, the process of extracting usability problems from textual data was made explicit, and the problems were extracted analytically. In other words, the proposed method was less ambiguous. Once a formulaic analysis procedure was established, textual data analysis could be performed easily and efficiently. The analysis could be performed without hesitation after data acquisition, and there were fewer omissions. In addition, it is expected that the procedure would be easy to use, even for novice designers.

It impacts the student's ability to solve prob-lems in new situations. Concept mapping is a learning strategy that has been proven to promote higher-order thinking. Concept map recomposition (KB-mapping) in the Kit-Build system is a closed concept mapping where learners are given concepts and links to build a concept map, and it has advantage that the recomposed map can be automatically diagnosed. It has been proven that KB-mapping improves the students' learning achievement similar to the traditional concept mapping called scratch concept map com-position (SC-mapping). However, the study on the effect of KB-mapping in fostering students' higher-order thinking has yet to be evaluated. This study designed and conducted an experiment to compare the impact of KB-mapping and SC-mapping on promoting students' ability in higher-order thinking. Fifty-four undergraduate students were assigned to either KB-Mapping or SC-Mapping for learning activities. The result of this study suggested that students who learn with KB-mapping had better abilities to solve questions of higher-order thinking than those who applied SC-mapping. The findings also suggested that the quality of students' concept maps affected their performance in solving higher-order thinking questions.

J	Ticehurst, JL; Kruger, H				Ticehurst, Jenifer L.; Kruger, Heleen			Systems thinking for general surveillance programs - using leverage points to guide program management	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						systems thinking; program coordinator; leverage points; feedback loops; information flow	AGRICULTURAL INNOVATION; POLICY-MAKERS; NETWORKS; CHALLENGES	With the increasing threat of pests, weeds and diseases to agriculture, the environment and our way of life, governments are becoming more reliant on general surveillance to fill biosecurity surveillance gaps. That is, engaging people from all walks of life in the monitoring and reporting of pests, weeds and diseases. It is often thought that instigating a general surveillance program simply requires the development of reporting tools and creating awareness of the program among intended target groups, but this is a simplistic view. This paper explores whether a broader approach identifies better ways to implement general surveillance programs to meet their goals and remain sustainable over the long-term, and therefore assist in program management. A systems thinking approach was used to identify the components within general surveillance programs, and their interactions. These components are the actors or people involved and their relationships; infrastructure like reporting tools and resources; formal and informal rules; and species or diseases of interest and their environment (included to account for the biophysical context). We explored what helped and hindered the design and implementation of general surveillance programs, drawing on international literature and the experiences of people in nine case studies from across Australia and New Zealand. Systems thinking helped to identify leverage points in the case studies, including feedback loops and information flow paths, and facilitated thought on how they can be used to improve programs. For example, sharing knowledge and experiences of actors from throughout the program being notifiers (i.e. the people who report pests, weeds and diseases), laboratory or herbarium staff, funding bodies, policy makers and others, built trust and ownership in the program and facilitated learning and self-organisation. This increased the capacity for innovation, adaptation, and continual improvement, leading to ongoing program benefits. Approaching program management using systems thinking helps structure program monitoring and evaluation and better target effort and resources to improve performance. However, this requires a dedicated program coordinator (or coordination team) with adequate resources to identify challenges and opportunities and adapt the program accordingly.

The junior Fellows Program, a partnership between the New York Academy of Medicine, New York City public schools, and regional academic medical centers, is designed to stimulate students' interest in health, science, medicine, and research. From seminars designed to advance junior Fellows' skills in identifying concrete strategies for improving health and preventing illness, to understanding the research process and the nature of scientific inquiry, the program engages junior Fellows in project-based learning, works to enhance their critical thinking skills, and helps them to foster positive interactions with practicing physicians and health professionals. Surveys of program graduates indicate the program has been influential in creating a high level of motivation to pursue careers related to health, science, and medicine. The program continues to work on enhancing educational opportunities for urban public school students and promoting career awareness for the health Professions, with a special emphasis on improving the proportion of minorities and women who enter these fields.

J	Yi, G				Yi, Ge			Design Research on the Network Multimedia Courseware for Art-Design Teaching	EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						art-design teaching; network multimedia courseware; courseware design	PERFORMANCE; STUDENTS; UNIVERSITY; BEHAVIORS; SCIENCE; CHILD	Multimedia technology is a information technology which comprehensively processes and controls information in form of text, graph, image, automation and sound. With the development of multimedia information technology, network teaching has played a significant role in modern teaching owe to its characterizations such as digit-orientation, information-orientation, massive amount of information, high interactivity, and wide coverage. This technology has become an indispensable auxiliary teaching approach, promoting the deep reform of education. However, the development of network education function is still immature. Moreover, the major of art design is a unique major focusing on innovation thinking, cultivation of innovation consciousness, encouraging students to experience, explore and rethink. Therefore, the resources for art-design network teaching is insufficient. On this basis, it is of great significance to apply multimedia technology to art-design course teaching, give full play the advantage of multimedia courseware, and enhance the scientization, professionalization and individualization of art-design education. This paper first introduces the research background and current status, then discusses the design methods of network multimedia courseware. The designing and making of art-design network teaching courseware is a key point for the construction of network teaching environment. The study on network teaching courseware designing and making is a necessity for deep reform of art-design as well as an important approach for exploring new development direction of art-design teaching.

J	Genel, A; Topçu, MS				Genel, Abdulkadir; Topcu, Mustafa Sami			Turkish preservice science teachers' socioscientific issues-based teaching practices in middle school science classrooms	RESEARCH IN SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Preservice science teachers; science classrooms; socioscientific issues-based instruction; teaching practice	SCIENTIFIC LITERACY; DECISION-MAKING; STUDENTS; ARGUMENTATION; KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION; INQUIRY; CONTEXT; MODEL	Background: Despite a growing body of research and curriculum reforms including socioscientific issues (SSI) across the world, how preservice science teachers (PST) or in-service science teachers can teach SSI in science classrooms needs further inquiry. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to describe the abilities of PSTs to teach SSI in middle school science classrooms, and the research question that guided the present study is: How can we characterize Turkish PSTs' SSI-based teaching practices in middle school science classrooms (ages 11-14)? Sample: In order to address the research question of this study, we explored 10 Turkish PSTs' SSI-based teaching practices in middle school science classrooms. A purposeful sampling strategy was used, thus, PSTs were specifically chosen because they were ideal candidates to teach SSI and to integrate SSI into the science curricula since they were seniors in the science education program who had to take the field experience courses. Design and method: The participants' SSI teaching practices were characterized in light of qualitative research approach. SSI-based teaching practices were analyzed, and the transcripts of all videotape recordings were coded by two researchers. Results: The current data analysis describes Turkish PSTs' SSI-based teaching practices under five main categories: media, argumentation, SSI selection and presentation, risk analysis, and moral perspective. Most of PSTs did not use media resources in their lesson and none of them considered moral perspective in their teaching. While the risk analyses were very simple and superficial, the arguments developed in the classrooms generally remained at a simple level. PSTs did not think SSI as a central topic and discussed these issues in a very limited time and at the end of the class period. Conclusions: The findings of this study manifest the need of the reforms in science education programs. The present study provides evidence that moral, media, argumentation, risk analysis, and pedagogical aspects of SSI-based instruction should be incorporated into educational courses designed for the Turkish teacher education programs such as the science teaching methods course. When we find ways to improve PSTs or science teachers' SSI teaching practices in terms of these components, we can provide useful information for curriculum developers, policy-makers, and science educators in Turkey and other countries, that are facing similar problems. We believe that this study would initiate more investigative and exploratory studies toward this goal.

In this context, various questions arise from students who think it is an imperative to provide clear answers timely. Even more so, when these students belong to the field of study of information and recognize that the transfer of information contributes to the optimization of communication processes, specifically in training environments. This is why this artide will report on a research experience whose main objective was to design a proposal for a virtual assistant that allowed solving the doubts of archival and library students in the virtual modality of the Inter-American School of Library Science -EIB- of the University of Antioquia, in order to optimize communication processes between students and those who coordinate the dynamics of virtuality in the institution. Such research process was based on the design thinking methodology that favored a state of empathy with the academic community which made it possible to identify the most recurrent concerns of students and their respective main thematic categories. In this sense, this was an initial exploratory and descriptive study that managed to obtain information which will serve as input for a next phase of development of a virtual assistant for the EIB.

Background: In collaborative partnerships, effective communications need to occur in patient, family, and health care professional meetings. The effectiveness of these meetings depends on the engagement of participants and the quality of the meeting process. The use of six thinking hats technique to engage all participants in effective dialogue is proposed. Design: Discussion paper. Data sources: Electronic databases, CINAHL, Pub Med, and Science Direct, were searched for years 1990 to 2017. Implications for nursing: Using six thinking hats technique in patient family meetings nurses can guide a process of dialogue that focuses decision making to build equal care partnerships inclusive of all participants. Nurses will need to develop the skills for using six thinking hats technique and provide support to all participants during the meeting process. Conclusion: Collaborative decision making can be augmented by six thinking hat technique to provide patients, families, and health professionals with opportunities to make informed decisions about care that considers key issues for all involved. Nurses who are most often advocates for patients and their families are in a unique position to lead this initiative in meetings as they network with all health professionals.

J	MonesHattal, B; Mandes, E				MonesHattal, B; Mandes, E			Enhancing visual thinking and learning with computer graphics and virtual environment design	COMPUTERS & GRAPHICS			English	Article								Prior to language development, all proto-human had was his senses and a significantly evolving brain [Bolles (1991) A Second Way of Knowing, Prentice Hall, New York]. Since we understand now how critically important language is to thinking, how could proto-human ''think'' in the absence of language as we know it? One answer is that proto-human depended upon visual learning as a primordial form of cognition, what we call today, ''a second way of learning'' with verbal learning presumably serving as the first learning system. The modern age has permitted visual learning to take a back-seat to verbal learning, however the capabilities of emerging digital visual technologies may help us recapture and extend our visual thinking and learning capabilities. This paper attempts to scratch the surface with regard to the visual thinking and learning potential afforded by the recent evolution in some computer graphics technologies. A general discussion of the scope and definition of visual thinking and learning is integrated with examples of both current research strategies and current and proposed teaching strategies. Our main focus has been on applications within a visually based art curriculum although computer graphics spans several discipline areas and, in most cases, includes some form of cooperative environment and development. Hence, it is hoped that the information contained here may have some useful applications to curriculum design in other discipline areas such as computer science, communication, mathematics and physics, just to name a few.

The intention of this article is to approach one particular aspect of this need: that is, how basic design education can be reconsidered to establish the arguably broken link between the 'learning by doing' tradition of a Bauhaus-oriented basic design education with the computational and parametric logic necessitated by contemporary design technologies. The authors present the overall outlines of a basic design course as offered in Beykent University Department of Industrial Design in Istanbul, Turkey. The programme consists of a series of exercises grouped in five modules and two 'binders' that are structured to link the fundamental notions and operations of design thinking covered in basic design courses of the first year with the analytical and computational-reasoning competencies that are developed mostly in the later years of design education.

Objective: Describe the development of a toolkit for patients with COPD or chronic heart failure and their informal caregivers enabling them to explore and express their perspective in conversations with healthcare professionals.Patient involvement: Patients, informal caregivers and healthcare professionals were involved in the design process from problem definition to solution development.Method: Design Thinking Approach using eight co-creation sessions and qualitative data-collection methods. Nineteen patients, ten informal caregivers and thirteen healthcare professionals participated in one or more co -creation sessions. Homogenous subgroups of participants were used in session 1, 2 and 4 and mixed groups were used in session 3, 5 and 6. Session 7 and 8 were used to test prototype toolkits.Results: Three challenges to expressing the personal perspective to healthcare professionals, four statements defining the desired situation for conversations, eleven design criteria for the toolkit and ten selection criteria for tools were identified. This information was used to develop a prototype toolkit.Discussion: Most patients and informal caregivers had moderate to high levels of education and all participating healthcare professionals were female with a majority of nurses and only three physicians. It is possible that this has influenced the design of the toolkit. Practical value: The toolkit can support patients and informal caregivers in exploring and expressing their perspective in conversations with healthcare professionals. Feasibility of the toolkit and implications for healthcare professionals will be examined in a pilot implementation study.

A mixed factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) of 3 (time: pre-test, post-test and persistence) x 2 (experimental group and control group) was used to test the hypothesis. The Bayesian factor analysis for mixed data was performed to identify the effects of design-oriented STEM education on differences between groups as well as within the group. The study results indicated that design-oriented STEM activities permanently increased the total scores of the children in the experimental group as regards the twenty-first-century skills. It also appeared that design-oriented STEM activities permanently enhanced all sub-dimensions of life and career skills; learning and innovation skills; and information, media and technology skills. In the end, a number of recommendations were presented in accordance with the results of the study.

The general science of networks is the subject of Albert-Lazlo Barabasi's Linked [A.-L. Barabasi, Linked: The New Science of Networks, Perseus, New York, 2002] and Duncan Watts' Six Degrees [D. Watts, Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age, Gardner's Books, New York, 2003]. Commonalities among complex biological networks, e.g., immune systems, social insects, and cellular metabolism, and their relation to intelligence in computational systems are explored in the proceedings of a interdisciplinary conference on "Distributed Autonomous Systems" [L.A. Segel, I.R. Cohen (Eds.), Design Principles for the Immune System and Other Distributed Autonomous Systems, Oxford University Press, New York, 2001]. The ideas discussed in the third book have led to me to propose four general principles of adaptive information processing in decentralized systems. These principles, and the relevance of "network thinking" for artificial intelligence (and vice versa), are the subject of the last two sections of the article. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The study was designed using a quantitative model and experimental design. 43 children including 22 in the experimental group and 21 in the control group attending preschool education institutions in the city center of Kirklareli in the school year of 2017-2018 participated in the study. In addition to the existing education programs, the storyline education program was applied by the researcher to the children in the experimental group for 10 weeks (an hour in two days a week) between 19.03.2018 and 22.05.2018. The children in the control group continued their current education programs. In the study, "personal information form" and the "Critical Thinking Skills Test for 5-6 year-old Children (CTTC)" developed by the researcher were used. In the analysis of the data, experimental design with pretest, posttest, retention test, control group was applied to analyze the data. In order to determine the effect of experimental process in cases where the data had normal distribution and homogeneity of the assumptions was provided, two-way ANOVA method was used for mixed patterns that could address the inter-group, intra-group and common effect between the pretest and posttest. In cases where assumptions were not provided, it was examined whether or not posttest and pretest difference scores differed based on the experimental and control groups. For this, independent samples t test was used in the cases where the normality assumption was not provided; whereas, Mann Whitney U test was used for the other situations. It was found as a result of the study that the education program prepared with storyline method made a significant difference in the total score of the critical thinking skills test and in the scores of interpretation, explanation, inference, analysis, and self-regulation subscales of the critical thinking skills test in children in the experimental group. When assessing the effect size of the significance revealed, a high effect size was found in the total score of the critical thinking skills test, an effect size above moderate in the analysis and self-regulation subscales, a moderate effect size in the inference and explanation subscales, and a low effect size quantity in the interpretation subscale.

J	Sijtsema, SJ; Fogliano, V; Hageman, M				Sijtsema, Siet J.; Fogliano, Vincenzo; Hageman, Madelinde			Tool to Support Citizen Participation and Multidisciplinarity in Food Innovation: Circular Food Design	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						co-creation; food product development; design thinking; circular food design; food system; multi disciplinary; visualization; creativity	PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; CONSUMER RESEARCH; DRIED FRUIT; CO-CREATION; CONSUMPTION; PERCEPTION; ADOPTION; MODELS; HEALTH; POLISH	Innovations are urgently required to transform toward a more circular food system in which the food production and processing is more sustainable and the dietary patterns of consumers are more healthy and sustainable. It is needed to be more innovative in a multidisciplinary and consumer oriented way. Therefore, this paper introduces circular food design model and presents some applications. This paper presents background information regarding relevant models of product development and combines approaches and insights from different disciplines, such as consumer and food science, all present in the food system. In addition, the linkage with design thinking is addressed. Moreover, research questions are presented focused on the identification, development and optimization phase with regard to agricultural production, food storage, processing, retail and consumption. This circular food design model can support a way of thinking that will lead to multidisciplinary and citizen participating in food product development. The added value of circular food design model is; first, the model stimulates a citizen participation approach in a creative way; second, the model supports communication and collaboration among all involved disciplines. The newly developed circular food design model visualizes an iterative approach meant to be a flexible and creative tool to structure the new food development in the different phases to support value creation in the food system in order to support its transition.

Human lives are often lost in road accidents due to the delay in accident detection by medical assistance. In fact, the accident's location and the driver's personal information are considered critical information that plays a vital role in preserving human life. Additionally, previous studies have found a limitation in the encryption of sensitive data; in fact, a leak of private information is thought to be one of the challenges that restrict the use of IoT devices. To resolve this problem, this research presents an intelligent security framework, and an Internet-of-Things-based system is proposed for immediate accident detection. Thus, this system requires the highest level of security and privacy to maintain the driver's privacy. Moreover, the design science research methodology was followed to design and evaluate the artifacts. Thus, the study's research resulted in the ability to design a secure and effective IoT-based system to detect and report a car accident instantly. In addition, the message is encrypted using Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption and sent through Message Queuing Telemetry Transport over GSM. The study's overall results show the flexibility with which the proposed artifact can be used for other purposes related to the IoT security framework to send and encrypt critical information.

Using Cognitive Load Theory to Inform Simulation Design and Practice	CLINICAL SIMULATION IN NURSING			English	Article						learning theory; simulation design; cognitive science; Cognitive load theory	PRINCIPLES	Cognitive science has long sought to explore the ways in which information is processed by the brain and to generate from this overarching constructs and models of thinking and learning. This article explores cognitive load theory, one approach to understanding learning, and articulates ways in which what is known about how people experience new learning environments can be used to create and optimize effective simulation learning environments. When designing and implementing simulation-based learning, extraneous load must be minimized by good design and the intrinsic load must be optimized for the learner. Doing so creates a more effective and valuable learning experience.

GSS support for strategic management has been primarily focused on qualitative analysis and the communication processes surrounding strategic planning. While fully developed in common decision-support systems, powerful simulation modeling and quantitative analytical tools have been difficult to integrate into GSS system configurations because they require increased cognitive load and expert modeling support, a central problem now addressed by collaboration engineering. A conceptual and functional bridge is needed to integrate the qualitative and quantitative approaches, reduce cognitive load, and provide modeling support that does not require experts. Acar's analytical causal mapping is introduced as a structured method for situational formulation and analysis of unstructured strategic problems. This form of causal mapping includes specific processes and analytical approaches offering cognitive modeling support for problem formulation. Its computational capabilities provide support for Systems Thinking approaches in a system easy to learn and use. Using the methodological template of the design science paradigm, we contribute a prototype system for the development and simulation of causal maps that uses RePast 2.0, a Java agent-based modeling (ABM) and simulation library.

J	Shin, KR; Lee, JH; Ha, JY; Kim, KH				Shin, Kyung Rim; Lee, Ja Hyung; Ha, Ju Young; Kim, Kon Hee			Critical thinking dispositions in baccalaureate nursing students	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						baccalaureate nursing students; California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory; Korea; longitudinal study; nursing education	CHINESE; SKILLS; RELIABILITY; NURSES	Aim. This paper reports an investigation into the critical thinking disposition of students enrolled in a baccalaureate nursing programme at a university in Korea. Background. Critical thinking may be summarized as a skilled process that conceptualizes and applies information from observation, experience, reflection, inference and communication in a technical manner. It is more of a rational act used as an instrument rather than as a result. Critical thinking is a core competency in nursing and has been widely discussed in nursing education. However, the results of previous research on the effectiveness of nursing education in improving students' critical thinking have been inconsistent. Methods. A longitudinal design was used with a convenience sample of 60 nursing students; 32 students participated four times in completing a questionnaire each March from 1999 to 2002. The California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory was administered to measure disposition to critical thinking. Results. There was a statistically significant improvement in critical thinking disposition score by academic year (F = 7.54, P = 0.0001). Among the subscales, open-mindedness, self-confidence, and maturity also showed a statistically significant difference by academic year (P = 0.0194, 0.0041, 0.0044). Conclusion. Teaching strategies to enhance critical thinking should be developed, in addition to further research on the effect of the nursing curriculum on students' critical thinking. Moreover, survey instruments could be adjusted to incorporate characteristics of the Korean culture.

J	Han, H				Han, Hyejung			Children's help-seeking behaviors and effects of domain knowledge in using Google and Kids.gov: Query formulation and results evaluation stages	LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							WEB SEARCH ENGINE; INFORMATION-SEEKING; PHYSICAL BEHAVIORS; YAHOOLIGANS; INTERNET; CONTEXT	Effective information seeking in IR systems is difficult for children because the designs of such systems do not reflect their needs and searching behaviors. A study of 30 8- to 10-year-old children explored help-seeking behaviors and use of help features when they formulated search queries and evaluated search results in IR systems. Data collection methods included performance-based domain knowledge quizzes as direct measurement, domain knowledge self-assessments as indirect measurement, questionnaires, think-aloud protocols, observations, and interviews. Open coding analysis. descriptive statistics and linear regression analysis were used to analyze children's help-seeking situations, types of-help features used and desired, and the effect of domain knowledge on help-seeking situations and use of help features when they formulated keywords and evaluated search results in Google and Kids.gov. Findings suggest that children encountered help-seeking situations when they formulated search queries and evaluated results. Also they used help features when they formulated keywords and evaluated search results in using Google and Kids.gov and suggested help features that they would have liked to have had. Finally, children's domain knowledge affected their help-seeking situations when they formulated keywords and use of help features when they evaluated search results. This study provides valuable information to systems designers.

The design development research model of Richey and Klien (2007) is used and divided into two phases: (1) to design and develop innovative learning and validate of its quality based on the interviews and survey from 13 experts, 10 teachers and 30 students, and (2) to test the tools' validity by three experts and 153 students from five junior high schools at five provinces in Thailand. The findings indicate that analytical thinking, creative thinking, problem-solving thinking and critical thinking skill are developed by researchers, and experienced and practiced by learners in their lessons. The higher order thinking skills of learners after experiencing the learning innovation have a higher average score than the previous one. Following the students' perspectives on the learning innovation, 1) The design of content is in line with students' knowledge levels, easy to understand, and enable to connect science contents to their daily life. However, some contents cannot fully cover into all classroom lessons; 2) Multimedia. A navigation design is easy for students to find information and direct to their needs. The icon symbols could hint the meaning of various information sources and have links to these sources. Also, multimedia could considerably explain scientific processes and help students understand better; 3) The design of problem scenarios supports easier connection to the daily life. In addition, using videos as a learning resource could suitably illustrate scientific process, and improve communicative and collaborative skills in problem solving.

J	Yang, TC; Lin, ZS				Yang, Tzu-Chi; Lin, Zhi-Shen			Enhancing elementary school students' computational thinking and programming learning with graphic organizers	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Elementary education; 21st century abilities; Teaching/learning strategies; Computational thinking; Graphic organizer	KINDERGARTEN CHILDRENS EXPLANATIONS; SCIENCE-EDUCATION; K-12; MODEL; FLOW; DISABILITIES; DESIGN; SKILLS	Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students' existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences.

Analogies and metaphors in creative design	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th Mudd Design Workshop	MAY 23-25, 2007	Harvey Mudd Coll, Claremont, CA		Harvey Mudd Coll	metaphor; analogy; creative design; idea generation; innovation processes; problem framing; design methods; design thinking; design education	ENGINEERING DESIGN; SIMILARITY; MANIFEST	In our increasingly flat and connected world, skills in innovation and creative design have emerged as key attributes for graduating engineering designers. Metaphors and analogies are commonly voiced as key tools for enhancing creative design yet little research has been performed on their relation to each other and their use within the design process. In this paper we discuss the relationship between metaphor and analogy use in the design process, with a focus on engineering education. We support our discussion with results from interviews and experiments with student designers. Our results highlight that both metaphor and analogy are spontaneously used by student designers and that metaphor dominates as the design tool for early problem-framing design phases whereas analogy dominates as a tool for concept generation. We also present an analysis of the metaphors for our understanding of design in use within Germany, the UK and Mexico. We found an 85 per cent overlap between textbook usages of metaphors in conceptual design in these countries as compared to textbooks authored in the United States, suggesting that cross-cultural differences in design understanding are relatively small in higher education. We close by presenting a design by analogy method to promote and enhance the use of analogy as a skill for graduating engineering designers.

Design: A systematic literature review of original research publications. Data Sources: In this systematic review, the papers published in English and Farsi databases of PubMed, Science Direct, ProQuest, ERIC, Google Scholar and Ovid, MagIran and SID, from 1975 to 2015 were reviewed by two independent researchers. Review Methods: Original research publications were eligible for review when they described simulation program directed on nursing student and nurses; used a control group or a pretest post-test design; and gave information about the effects of simulation on critical thinking. Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for inclusion. Methodological quality of the included studies was also independently assessed by the reviewers, using a checklist developed by Greenhalgh et al. and the checklist of Cochrane Center. Data related to the original publications were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. No statistical pooling of outcomes was performed, due to the large heterogeneity of outcomes. Results: After screening the titles and abstracts of 787 papers, 16 ones were included in the review according to the inclusion criteria. These used experimental or quasi-experimental designs. The studies used a variety of instruments and a wide range of simulation methods with differences in duration and numbers of exposures to simulation. Eight of the studies reported that simulation training positively affected the critical thinking skills. However, eight studies reported ineffectiveness of simulation on critical thinking. Conclusion: Studies are conflicting about the effect of simulation on nurses and nursing students' critical thinking. Also, a large heterogeneity exists between the studies in terms of the instruments and the methods used. Thus, more studies with careful designs are needed to produce more credible evidence on the effectiveness of simulation on critical thinking. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Engineering design is a complex activity. Differences in system architectures and information structures, and co-ordination requirements tend to reduce the effectiveness of distributed design. Current thinking indicates that multi-agent systems (MAS) can alleviate some of the complex engineering design problems. In this paper, it is argued that agent attributes such as proactiveness and autonomy can overcome these limitations. Agents provide a flexible and dynamic approach to distributed/multidisciplinary design team which can reduce redundant design activities, and improve coordination. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Formal and Informal Learning and First-Year Psychology Students' Development of Scientific Thinking: A Two-Wave Panel Study	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						epistemic cognition; informal learning; need for cognition; self-efficacy; scientific thinking; psychology students	EPISTEMIC BELIEFS; SELF-EFFICACY; ONTOLOGICAL COGNITION; HIGHER-EDUCATION; KNOWLEDGE; ENGAGEMENT; SCIENCE; NEED; INTELLIGENCE; PERSONALITY	Scientific thinking is a predicate for scientific inquiry, and thus important to develop early in psychology students as potential future researchers. The present research is aimed at fathoming the contributions of formal and informal learning experiences to psychology students' development of scientific thinking during their 1st-year of study. We hypothesize that informal experiences are relevant beyond formal experiences. Firstyear psychology student cohorts from various European countries will be assessed at the beginning and again at the end of the second semester. Assessments of scientific thinking will include scientific reasoning skills, the understanding of basic statistics concepts, and epistemic cognition. Formal learning experiences will include engagement in academic activities which are guided by university authorities. Informal learning experiences will include non-compulsory, self-guided learning experiences. Formal and informal experiences will be assessed with a newly developed survey. As dispositional predictors, students' need for cognition and self-efficacy in psychological science will be assessed. In a structural equation model, students' learning experiences and personal dispositions will be examined as predictors of their development of scientific thinking. Commonalities and differences in predictive weights across universities will be tested. The project is aimed at contributing information for designing university environments to optimize the development of students' scientific thinking.

The latter calls for coordinating between different types of uncertainties, related to three types of relevant reasoning: statistical, scientific, and nature of science uncertainties. This article examines separately the uncertainties that young students articulate as they engage in activities designed to concurrently foster all three types of reasoning, and also explores how these different types can interrelate. The context of Citizen Science is particularly suited for this goal, providing a unique pedagogical opportunity for learning scientific content by engaging learners in authentic scientific practices, including data analysis. Based on literature from the three fields of statistics, science and nature of science education, we offer an integrative framework, Deterministic Relativistic and Middle ground (DReaM), which consists of nine sub-categories of uncertainty articulations. We utilize it to analyze an instrumental case study of a pair of middle school students' (ages 13 and 14) participation in a pilot study of an interdisciplinary extended learning sequence, as part of the Radon Citizen Science Project. The results of an interpretative microgenetic analysis identified all nine DReaM uncertainty articulations sub-categories. These are illustrated in the Findings section with key scenes from the pair's participation. The discussion depicts how these sub-categories manifested in this particular case study and suggests interrelations between them in a more extended depiction of the DReaM framework. We conclude with the pedagogical implications of the extended framework.

The analysis results showed that there were three clusters of RSE studies: robots in elementary science education, robot-based STEM activities, and robot-facilitated computational thinking. In terms of the research issues, more studies were conducted across-disciplines. Regarding thematic classifications, "general benefits of educational robots" was the most frequently investigated issue, while "diversity and broadening participation," and "creativity and motivation" were less frequently discussed. The most adopted research methods were quantitative and mixed methods, focusing on measuring learners' cognition and affect. Most of the interventions in the empirical studies adopted pedagogical interventions. In terms of the interaction issue, LEGO was adopted the most, followed by self-made robots; moreover, robots frequently played the role of tools in science education. From the perspective of specific robotics content knowledge, "control" (e.g. programming) comprised the majority. The most adopted learning strategy was project-based learning, followed by issue-based discussion. Regarding assessment issues, the most adopted evaluation approaches to evaluating students' performance were questionnaires, observation, verbal interviews, and artifacts to assess the quality of learning activities.

In the article I discuss benefits and content of systemic thinking in connection to safety. Systemic thinking has to do with creating an understanding of systems in an environment. How can macro behaviour be understood as generated by micro interactions of its parts? The article places a focus on nuclear power in Finland, because it avoids dangers of being too abstract. An application of safety principles during design and operation makes it possible to reach acceptable safety and avoid open ended discussions. A definition of necessary and sufficient requirements for safety condensed into claims and evidence can be collected from systems design and operation. The article starts with an account of concepts from systemic thinking and safety management, to discuss how sociotechnical models can be used. A separation between humans, technology, organisation and information provides a system of systems model of the plant. Using this model one may consider safe and dangerous regions of the plant state space. A proper management of design and operation makes it possible to argue that used practices provide mechanisms for early detection and correction of deficiencies in plant systems. Important components are management systems, decision support, performance evaluation, organisational learning, staff proficiency and stakeholders. In the discussion part of the article remaining challenges in ensuring safety are brought forward. The article concludes that systemic thinking and a simultaneous consideration of entirety and details are important components in ensuring nuclear safety.

Concept mapping enables nursing students connect new information to existing knowledge and integrates interdisciplinary knowledge. However, there is a lack of evidence related to critical thinking ability and concept mapping in nursing education. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effect of concept mapping in developing critical thinking in nursing education. Design: This systematic review was reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Data sources: A search was conducted in PubMed, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing concept mapping and traditional teaching method were retrieved. Review methods: Data were collected by two reviewers according to the data extraction tables. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed by other two reviewers. The results of meta-analysis were presented using mean difference (MD). Result: Thirteen trials were summarized in the systematic review and eleven trials were included in the meta analysis. The pooled effect size showed that, comparing with traditional methods, concept mapping could improve subjects' critical thinking ability measured by California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI), California Critical Thinking Skill Test (CCTST) and Critical Thinking Scale (CTS). The subgroup analyses showed that concept mapping improved the score of all subscales. Conclusion: The result of this review indicated that concept mapping could affect the critical thinking affective dispositions and critical thinking cognitive skills. Further high quality research using uniform evaluation is required. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Lessons from Students in a Critical Thinking Course: A Case for the Third Pedagogy	JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION			English	Review						critical thinking; reflective practice; research methods; situated learning; aptitude; learning organizations; pedagogies	INFORMATION; EDUCATION	There have been many calls for strengthening the level of critical thinking among dental students and faculty members. but few analyses of how such curricular experiences actually affect them. This report provides a rich, multifaceted description of eight years' experience teaching a course in critical thinking. Among the data analyzed were a) course materials and learning experiences, b) student products demonstrating critical thinking. c) tests of subject matter knowledge d) content analysis of what students and faculty members find problematic, e) a test of critical thinking aptitude, f) two personality inventories, measures of didactic and clinical performance, and h) student comments and evaluation of instruction. These data support the view that critical thinking involves more than knowledge and application of skills relative to science and research that can be taught using traditional didactic methods. Personality factors emerged as predictive of both critical thinking and clinical performance, and students' approaches to learning appeared to be influenced by their practical considerations of what is needed to practice, rather than by the logic of good science. This analysis argues for designing curricula on the full concept of competency (knowledge, skills, and values needed to function as a dental practitioner) and for exploring a third pedagogy of reflective practice to supplement the traditional ones of didactic and skill teaching in dental education.

J	Yuan, STD; Hsu, ST				Yuan, Soe-Tsyr Daphne; Hsu, Shiou-Tian			Enhancing service system design: An entity interaction pattern approach	INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS			English	Article						Service system design; System thinking; Interaction pattern; Alliance strategy; Service innovation	ALLIANCES; SCIENCE	The notion of system thinking and the Industrial Marketing and Purchasing Group (IMP)'s findings have been emphasizing that "interaction is the basis analysis unit" of service systems or enterprises. Service system design is an attempt to change the outcome of a service ecosystem and make it more innovative in terms of figuring out not only who those entities are and what their outcomes are, but more importantly how they interact to realize their service values. The design of a service system could accordingly be viewed as changes made to the interactions. In the paper, system entity interactions are classified into patterns to become more analyzable, and different patterns can serve as measurements and guidelines for enterprises to follow and use to gain higher service value. To justify the important role of interaction in the service value creating process, a particular information system is developed and evaluated to explore the benefits of using interaction patterns for enterprise users to create their service values.

Different Strokes for Different Folks: Visual Presentation Design between Disciplines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS			English	Article						Presentations; information visualization; design; visual analysis	VISUALIZATION; THINKING	We present an ethnographic study of design differences in visual presentations between academic disciplines. Characterizing design conventions between users and data domains is an important step in developing hypotheses, tools, and design guidelines for information visualization. In this paper, disciplines are compared at a coarse scale between four groups of fields: social, natural, and formal sciences; and the humanities. Two commonplace presentation types were analyzed: electronic slideshows and whiteboard "chalk talks". We found design differences in slideshows using two methods - coding and comparing manually-selected features, like charts and diagrams, and an image-based analysis using PCA called eigenslides. In whiteboard talks with controlled topics, we observed design behaviors, including using representations and formalisms from a participant's own discipline, that suggest authors might benefit from novel assistive tools for designing presentations. Based on these findings, we discuss opportunities for visualization ethnography and human-centered authoring tools for visual information.

J	Avci, D; Ataç-Öksüz, M				Avci, Dilek; Atac-Oksuz, Merve			The relationship between resilience and solution-oriented thinking in nursing students	NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE			English	Article						Nursing students; Resilience; Solution-oriented thinking	MENTAL-HEALTH; STRESS; EDUCATION	Objective: This study aimed to determine the relationship between resilience and solution-oriented thinking in nursing students. Background: Although resilience seems to be related with solution-oriented thinking in nursing students, there are only a few studies investigating these two variables in the literature. Design: This is a cross-sectional survey study. Methods: This study was conducted with 585 nursing students in Turkey, between February 2022 and May 2022. The data were collected using a personal information form, the resilience scale for nurses (RSN) and solution focused inventory (SFI). To analyze the data, descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation and multivariate linear regression analysis were used. Results: In this study, the mean scores the nursing students obtained from the RSN and the SFI were 71.96 (SD 8.11) and 51.49 (SD 6.21), respectively. The correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between resilience and solution-oriented thinking. Gender, economic status, grade point average and solution focused thinking skills were determined to be the significant predictive factors of the resilience levels of the students. Conclusions: This study shows that solution-oriented thinking is an important determinant of resilience. Therefore, starting from the first year of nursing education, students' resilience levels and solution-oriented thinking skills should be evaluated, and the curriculum should be arranged to increase students' resilience levels.

J	Solberg, H; Devik, SA; Bell, HT; Olsen, RM				Solberg, Hege; Devik, Siri Andreassen; Bell, Hege Therese; Olsen, Rose Mari			Thinking strategies used by registered nurses during drug administration in nursing homes-An observational study	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article; Early Access						drug administration; Norway; nursing; nursing home; observation; thinking strategies	QUALITATIVE CONTENT-ANALYSIS; MEDICATION	AimTo explore registered nurses' thinking strategies during the drug administration process in nursing homes.DesignAn exploratory qualitative design.MethodsEight registered nurses, one male and seven female, in five nursing home wards in Mid-Norway were observed during 15 drug dispensing rounds (175 drug dispensing episodes). Think Aloud sessions with follow-up individual interviews were conducted. The Think Aloud data were analysed using deductive qualitative content analysis based on Marsha Fonteyn's description of 17 thinking strategies. Interview data were used to clarify missing information and validate the content of Think Aloud data.ResultsThe registered nurses used all 17 thinking strategies described by Fonteyn, including several variants of each strategy. The three most frequent were 'providing explanations', 'setting priorities' and 'drawing conclusions'. In addition, we found two novel thinking strategies that did not fit into Fonteyn's template, which were labelled 'controlling' and 'interacting'. Among all strategies, 'controlling' was by far the most used, serving as a means for the registered nurses to stay on track and navigate through various interruptions, while also minimising errors during drug dispensing.ConclusionThe study highlights the diverse thinking strategies employed by registered nurses in nursing homes during medication administration. The findings emphasise the multifaceted nature of medication administration and underscore the importance of skilled personnel in ensuring medication safety. Recognising the significance of these findings is crucial for maintaining patient well-being and upholding medication safety standards in healthcare settings.Relevance to Clinical PracticeUnderstanding the thinking strategies employed by registered nurses can inform training programmes and enhance the clinical judgements of health care professionals involved in medication administration, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced medication errors in practice.Patient or Public ContributionPatients were involved in this study as recipients of drugs which the nurses distributed during the observations. The patients were involved as a third party and consent to the observations was either given by the patients themselves or relatives in cases where the patient was not competent to consent. No personal information was collected about the patients.Reporting MethodThe reporting of this study adhered to the COREQ checklist.

J	Chen, JY				Chen, Jinyu			A Study on the Correlations between Thinking Styles and Academic Achievement in Web-Based Environmental Education	EKOLOJI			English	Article						web-based instruction; environmental education; thinking style; academic achievement	GAMIFICATION	The mature development of web-based teaching platforms, software/hardware technologies, and research on related instruction in past years could support total web-based instruction, instead of being the role of assisting traditional teaching. The advance of information and communications technology drives many researchers to explore the development of web-based instruction. Students encountering problems in the learning processes is not necessarily the lack of learning ability, but the inappropriate match between teachers' teaching methods and students' thinking and learning methods. Immutable instruction and assessment methods might benefit some students with certain thinking types and learning styles, but are unfavorable for others. This study intends to discuss the correlation between thinking styles and academic achievement in Web-Based Environmental Education. The quasi-experimental research with experimental design is adopted in this study, and two classes from Southwest University of Science and Technology is proceeded the experimental teaching. After retrieving the research data, the research results are summarized as below. 1. Environmental Education would affect learning achievement. 2. Environmental Education would influence learning retention. 3. Thinking styles present significantly positive effects on learning effect in academic achievement. 4. Thinking styles show remarkably positive effects on learning gain in academic achievement. Suggestions based on the results are further proposed in this study, expecting to help activate classroom climate, improve instruction, and implement the promotion of teaching quality in order to correspond to the rationale and spirit of educational reform.

J	Lawrence, EE				Lawrence, E. E.			On the problem of oppressive tastes in the public library	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Readers' advisory; Diversity; Library ethics; Social justiced; Taste; Feminist aesthetics; Democracy	SOCIAL-JUSTICE; RESPONSIBILITY; DIVERSITY	Purpose Contemporary adult readers' advisory aims to adhere to (what I term) a pure preference satisfaction model in which librarians provide nonjudgmental book recommendations that satisfy their patrons' aesthetic tastes rather than improve upon them. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether readers' advisors really ought to treat all such tastes as essentially benign, even when doing so may conflict with core commitments to diversity and social responsibility. Design/methodology/approach This paper utilizes a thought experiment to interrogate our intuitions regarding the practice of recommending recreational materials featuring marginalized protagonists. The author also draws on theoretical insights from feminist aesthetician A.W. Eaton's innovative work on taste in bodies to formulate argumentation addressing the ethical dilemma presented here. Findings Our reading tastes can, in fact, be oppressive, working to maintain unjust power relations that are often thought to be the product merely of bad beliefs. On the view advanced here, oppressive tastes function as real obstacles to collective self-governance because they systematically distort our judgments of the credibility, empathic accessibility, and fundamental worth of our fellow democratic citizens. Librarians' obligation to protect and promote democracy, therefore, provides practitioners with a crucial justification for recommending diverse books to all readers, even (and perhaps especially) those who actively disprefer them. Originality/value The paper illustrates how contemporary work in analytic (and specifically feminist) aesthetics can furnish LIS scholars with the intellectual resources to resolve political problems in the library. The author's analysis also lays the groundwork for further consideration of alternative ideals for readers' advisory that will capitalize on the service's educative and emancipatory potential.

A mixed-methods systematic review	BMJ OPEN			English	Review						Maternal medicine; Adverse events; Toxicity; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; Systematic Review	OXYTOCIN; RECOMMENDATIONS	ObjectivesTo synthesise evidence on the perceptions of healthcare providers (HCPs) about the quality of oxytocin and misoprostol available in their settings, and their actions as a result of these perceptions.DesignMixed-methods systematic review.Eligibility criteriaWe included quantitative and qualitative studies reporting HCPs' perceptions about oxytocin or misoprostol quality.Data sourcesWe searched CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Ebscohost, Embase, PubMed, Global Index Medicus, Portal regional BVS, PsycNET, Scopus and Web of Science from inception to 31 March 2022 and grey literature.Risk of biasWe used the Center for Evidence-Based Management critical appraisal tool for surveys. For qualitative studies, we used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool.Data extraction and synthesisTwo independent reviewers performed study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. We conducted separate quantitative and qualitative syntheses and integrated the evidence into a narrative synthesis (convergent segregated review design).ResultsWe included five (three quantitative and two qualitative) studies, of moderate or high quality, conducted in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In the three quantitative studies (N=7065 participants), 8.2-21.3% of HCPs had experienced problems due to known/suspected low-quality oxytocin and 3.3% due to low-quality misoprostol. In the two qualitative studies, perception of oxytocin quality varied. In quantitative studies, when confronted with suspected/known low-quality oxytocin, 29-78% of HCPs would inform a supervisor, 62% would document this in writing, 45-54% would change to another drug and 5-37% would double the dose of oxytocin. Qualitative evidence suggests that many HCPs do not formally report suspected low-quality oxytocin or misoprostol, and use higher doses or additional uterotonics.ConclusionsA proportion of HCPs from LMICs perceive oxytocin to be of low quality. There is very limited evidence on their perceptions about misoprostol. Many HCPs do not report suspected low-quality uterotonics but change to another medicine or double the dose of oxytocin.PROSPERO registration numberCRD42022323812.

Background: Child and adolescent obesity is a critical public health problem. As environmental factors are a primary contributor, understanding the role of design in our surrounding environment highlights an important area of interdisciplinary study. Design strategies have been used successfully to increase stair use and reduce sedentary behavior and can be used to further promote healthier diet and activity choices among adolescents and families. Methods: We leveraged the human-centered design-thinking process through (1) qualitative interviews and survey instruments, (2) persona and prompt development, and (3) a design workshop with multidisciplinary stakeholders. Results: Five personas were developed from the qualitative data and used in a design-thinking workshop. During the workshop, participants generated 12 influential factors and nine points of decision which were used to generate 33 solutions spanning the design continuum (from information and policy design to the design of urban, architectural, and interior environments) aimed at improving nutrition and physical activity among adolescents. Additionally, a tool kit was prototyped, which includes interview guides, a persona framework, and a workshop facilitation guide. Conclusions: Our novel process led to the generation of design solutions that can be implemented to expand and improve upon existing interventions for childhood obesity and create environments that encourage positive health outcomes.

In particular, how physicians talk about and use images are discussed. Findings from evaluation studies of clinical imaging computer information systems suggest that the role and interpretation of images is negotiated, an example of how what is seen is influenced by the practice community, and, therefore is situated in specific instances of clinical decision making. An understanding of professional vision with respect to how physicians use and think about images may aid in developing clinical imaging systems, computer-based patient records, and other clinical information systems that could integrate well with clinical work practice.

However, whether students' learning attitude towards STEM is related to their CT skills remains unknown. Two studies were conducted to address this knowledge gap. In Study 1, we validated a newly developed STEM learning attitude scale among a sample of Chinese primary school students (N= 489). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis results revealed that the scale which consisted of three factors (mathematics, science and information technology) could sufficiently measure primary school students' STEM learning attitude in the current sample. In Study 2, we explored the association between students' STEM learning attitude and their CT skills. Evidence revealed that learning attitude towards STEM significantly predicted CT skills. We also found that girls had a more positive learning attitude towards STEM than boys, and the fourth grade might be the key period for the development of CT skills. Implications for promoting primary school students' STEM learning and CT skills were also discussed.

Sketching designs using the Five Design-Sheet methodology	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) / IEEE VIS Conference	OCT 25-30, 2015	Chicago, IL	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Visualizat & Graph Tech Comm, InfoVis, SciVis		Lo-fidelity prototyping; User-centred design; Sketching for visualization; Ideation	VISUALIZATION; INFORMATION; FRAMEWORK; MODEL; SYSTEM	Sketching designs has been shown to be a useful way of planning and considering alternative solutions. The use of lofidelity prototyping. especially paper-based sketching. can save time, money and converge to better solutions more quickly. However. this design process is often viewed to be too informal. Consequently users do not know how to manage their thoughts and ideas (to first think divergently, to then finally converge on a suitable solution). We present the Five Design Sheet (FdS) methodology. The methodology enables users to create information visualization interfaces through lo-fidelity methods. Users sketch and plan their ideas. helping them express different possibilities, think through these ideas to consider their potential effectiveness as solutions to the task (sheet 1); they create three principle designs (sheets 2,3 and 4); before converging on a final realization design that can then be implemented (sheet 5). In this article, we present (i) a review of the use of sketching as a planning method for visualization and the benefits of sketching, (ii) a detailed description of the Five Design Sheet (FdS) methodology, and (iii) an evaluation of the FdS using the System Usability Scale. along with a case-study of its use in industry and experience of its use in teaching.

J	Zhang, PY; Soergel, D				Zhang, Pengyi; Soergel, Dagobert			Cognitive mechanisms in sensemaking: A qualitative user study	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							INFORMATION EXTRACTION; MODEL; CONSTRUCTION; CLASSIFICATION; ONTOLOGY; SCIENCE; SENSE	Throughout an information search, a user needs to make sense of the information found to create an understanding. This requires cognitive effort that can be demanding. Building on prior sensemaking models and expanding them with ideas from learning and cognitive psychology, we examined the use of cognitive mechanisms during individual sensemaking. We conducted a qualitative user study of 15 students who searched for and made sense of information for business analysis and news writing tasks. Through the analysis of think-aloud protocols, recordings of screen movements, intermediate work products of sensemaking, including notes and concept maps, and final reports, we observed the use of 17 data-driven and structure-driven mechanisms for processing new information, examining individual concepts and relationships, and detecting anomalies. These cognitive mechanisms, as the basic operators that move sensemaking forward, provide in-depth understanding of how people process information to produce sense. Meaningful learning and sensemaking are closely related, so our findings apply to learning as well. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the sensemaking process-how people think-and this better understanding can inform the teaching of thinking skills and the design of improved sensemaking assistants and mind tools.

J	Lu, HP; Chen, JH; Lee, CF				Lu, Hui-Ping; Chen, Jun-Hong; Lee, Chang-Franw			Supporting Creative Responses in Design Education - The Development and Application of the Graphic Design Composition Method	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION			English	Article						Analytic Composition Method; creative design; design education; design method; graphic design		Inspiration is the primary element of good design. Designers, however, also risk not being able to find inspiration. Novice designers commonly find themselves to be depressed during the conceptual design phase when they fail to find inspiration and the information to be creative. Accordingly, under the graphic design parameter, we have developed the Analytic Composition Method (ACM)' to guide novice designers in gradually breaking through their usual modes of thinking to construct their own methods of composition. This method provides a variety of creative modes for the design field. Three stages are presented in this study. A design method is first constructed based on the results of a pretest and the existing composition methods of graphical design. We then apply the design method to three iterations of graphic design instruction. Lastly, we conduct an expert interview to evaluate the usefulness of this method. The following are the results obtained. 1. Most of the participants tested sought inspiration visually; they usually began their design process from image data and do not use the data beyond imagery. 2. The results of teaching activities show that using this method as a tool for graphic design enables various sources of inspiration to generate different modes of thinking and creative expression. 3. Our method could potentially be used for basic composition training and project design execution. However, the application of this method may vary with different design objectives.

An Interdisciplinary Approach to Integrating Computational Thinking in a Culinary and Restaurant Management Course	MATHEMATICS			English	Article						technologies for mathematics; computational thinking; training and education applications; culinary and restaurant management; information and communication technologies	STUDENTS; EDUCATION; HOSPITALITY; PERCEPTIONS; INFORMATION; TECHNOLOGY	In recent years, with the flourishing of the catering economy and the trends in computer technology, restaurant operators have increasingly relied on employees with computational and information skills. Breaking through the traditional teaching method of mere lecturing, the study conducts a teaching demonstration by integrating the computational thinking concept and a Microsoft Excel computational system on the school's E-learning platform into the teaching of a Culinary and Restaurant Management course. A non-equivalent control group pretest-posttest study with a quasi-experimental design is adopted for the assignment of experimental participants and the design of the course. The results show that a curriculum design with computational thinking significantly improves the effectiveness of students' learning in digital technology and is especially helpful for the cultivation of the key capabilities of menu design and cost planning among restaurant management skills. The study makes the following contributions: during the Culinary and Restaurant Management course, the use of the E-learning platform and computing programs such as Microsoft Excel is associated with greater learning effectiveness than traditional teaching methods. The research results can serve as a reference for promoting an E-catering business model and a sustainable educational model in the future.

Increased science has been presented to students who spend a lot of time utilizing technology. They similarly did greater mathematical abilities. IT has a good effect on student learning must be included in classroom education. Art education must shift from a teacher-centred to a student-centred approach, and students' passive reception of knowledge must be altered. Students' academic enthusiasm and awareness must be fostered, and their ability to locate knowledge resources must be enhanced. Using pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) in visual art education as a benchmark and this study examines art teachers' PCK proficiency in this area. Social learning theory is applied in the art education curriculum through observational learning based on the Artificial Intelligence-based Creative Thinking Skills Analysis Model (AI-CTSAM). An analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and a grey clustering-based performance analysis model are established to enhance AI's effectiveness in art instruction. Most of the methods to assess clustering performance exist in two types in which one is irrelevant actions requiring labels of foundation truth. Examples are Adjusted Rand, Fowlkes-Mallows, Mutual information scores, Homogeneity, Completeness, and V measurements. Model-based cluster analysis is a new classification approach for investigating population heterogeneity utilizing a limited multivariate mixture. Students can describe, analyze, interpret, and evaluate artwork through the visual art education curriculum.

Traditional curricula that focused on conveying research-derived knowledge are slowly integrating design thinking as a key learning objective. In part, this is motivated by the realization that infovis is a wicked design problem, requiring a different kind of design work. In this paper we describe, VIZITCARDS, a card-driven workshop developed for our graduate infovis class. The workshop is intended to provide practice with good design techniques and to simultaneously reinforce key concepts. VIZITCARDS relies on principles of collaborative-learning and research on parallel design to generate positive collaborations and high-quality designs. From our experience of simulating a realistic design scenario in a classroom setting, we find that our students were able to meet key learning objectives and their design performance improved during the class.

An electronic cross-facility health record (ECHR) system can support the immediate exchange of information among PPC professionals. Based on a needs assessment, a prototype ECHR system was developed. Methods: To evaluate potential users' perspective regarding the system, a qualitative observational study was conducted consisting of a concurrent think-aloud session and a semi-structured qualitative interview. Results: Twenty PPC professionals (nurses, physicians) from specialized outpatient PPC teams, a PPC unit, and medical offices rated the ECHR system as a helpful tool to improve the exchange and collection of information, communication between PPC professionals, and treatment planning. From the user's point of view, the basic logic of the ECHR system should be further adapted to improve the interaction of data remirrored from patient records of outpatient and inpatient care with those entered via the system. The users wished for further functions (text search) and content (information on therapies). Some content, such as the treatment process, needs to be further adapted. Conclusion: The developed ECHR system needs to be more specific in some features by offering all available information; while for other features, be less specific to offer a quick overview. The ability to share information promptly and automatically was seen as a tremendous improvement to the quality of care for PPC patients.</p>	[Busse, Theresa Sophie; Jux, Chantal; Kernebeck, Sven; Ehlers, Jan Peter] Witten Herdecke Univ, Sch Med, Fac Hlth, Dept Didact & Educ Res Hlth Sci, D-58448 Witten, Germany; [Dreier, Larissa Alice; Meyer, Dorothee; Zernikow, Boris] PedSci Res Inst, D-45711 Datteln, Germany; [Dreier, Larissa Alice; Meyer, Dorothee; Zernikow, Boris] Witten Herdecke Univ, Fac Hlth, Dept Childrens Pain Therapy & Pediat Palliat Care, D-58448 Witten, Germany; [Zenz, Daniel] Smart Q Softwaresyst GmbH, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Zernikow, Boris] Childrens & Adolescents Hosp, Pediat Palliat Care Ctr, D-45711 Datteln, Germany		Busse, TS (corresponding author), Witten Herdecke Univ, Sch Med, Fac Hlth, Dept Didact & Educ Res Hlth Sci, D-58448 Witten, Germany.

J	Hwang, GJ; Wu, YJ; Chang, CY				Hwang, Gwo-Jen; Wu, Yi-Jung; Chang, Ching-Yi			A Mobile-Assisted Peer Assessment Approach for Evidence-Based Nursing Education	CIN-COMPUTERS INFORMATICS NURSING			English	Article						Critical thinking; Evidence-based nursing; Information technology; Mobile learning; Peer assessment; Technology	STUDENTS PERFORMANCE; FEEDBACK; DESIGN; TECHNOLOGY; MOTIVATION; EXPERIENCE; ATTITUDES; AWARENESS; QUALITY; REDUCE	Students who learn evidence-based nursing can assist the healthcare team to make proper medical decisions and provide patients with valuable advice, thus optimizing the quality of patient care in specific situations. In clinical work, nursing staff members participate in decision making by searching for relevant empirical nursing literature, a basic ability required to enter clinical practice. In traditional instruction, nursing students are taught the Problem, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome method to learn to use library resources and gather empirical nursing knowledge for decision making. However, it is a challenge for most students to have sufficient practice to make decisions correctly and to have opportunities to perceive medical cases from diverse perspectives. Therefore, we propose a peer assessment-based Problem, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome approach to help nursing students locate correct evidence and make appropriate decisions about patient care. We performed an experiment with our approach in a nursing university training program. The experimental results reveal that the subjects learning with the proposed approach show better evidence-based nursing knowledge, learning attitude, and critical thinking ability than those learning with the traditional approach.

Work on the development of life suggests that life is a simplification of surrounding environmental information, and therefore life does not generate new information. Second, the psychology of pareidolia suggests we find design as a bias of our information processing, rather than observing something that exists. The second half of the article offers a critique of how the metaphors we use to describe God and the world shape our approaches to solving theological and philosophical questions (particularly theodicy). I offer some organic metaphors in place of the usual mechanistic metaphors to think about how the design argument could be reformulated.

J	Wu, L; Liu, H; Bao, YC				Wu, Liang; Liu, Heng; Bao, Yongchuan			Outside-in thinking, value chain collaboration and business model innovation in manufacturing firms	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING			English	Article						Outside-in thinking; Business model innovation; Competitive intensity; Regulatory volatility; Customer interaction	PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SPEED; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; CORPORATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP; OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE EVIDENCE; ORIENTATION; RESOURCE; SERVICE; DESIGN; COOPETITION	Purpose This paper aims to explore how manufacturing firms pursue business model innovation (BMI) through their use of outside-in thinking. Design/methodology/approach Survey data were collected on 175 Chinese manufacturing firms. A regression model was used to verify the research results. Findings Manufacturing firms rely on outside-in thinking to develop BMI under different market and institutional environments. From a whole-value-chain perspective, interacting with customers and sharing information with suppliers are two key ways to develop BMI. Research limitations/implications Firms focus on customer needs, sense the dynamics of external markets and technology and seize market opportunities to measure outside-in thinking. Empirical results suggest using other measures of outside-in thinking. BMI itself can be multidimensional, so scholars could consider BMI's diverse dimensions and measurements, which may demand different kinds of outside-in thinking. Practical implications Manufacturing firms can use outside-in thinking to overcome inertia and rigidity and increase their knowledge, information and technology. Managers should develop outside-in thinking to respond quickly to emerging economies. Managers should use value chain collaboration and improve the firm's capacity to interact with customers and suppliers to apply the benefits of outside-in thinking to their BMI. Originality/value The study explores how outside-in thinking is a key driver of BMI. Applying the whole-value-chain view, it finds that interacting with customers and suppliers connects outside-in thinking with BMI. It also highlights the effects of intense market competition and volatile government regulation on BMI.

Use of Natural Language Processing to Discover Evidence of Systems Thinking	IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						Document classification; information retrieval; naive Bayes; natural language processing; systems approach; systems thinking; vector space classification (VSC); vector space model (VSM)		In prior work, we proposed elements of a generalized core language for systems thinking that characterizes a systems approach. We developed this foundational language through the relationship between critical thought and systems in the definition of systems thinking. We submitted our interpretation of this language, i.e., the Dimensions of Systems Thinking (DST), to the systems community for further development. Assuming that the DST provides a basis in language to express systems thought in a systems design or analysis, our objective in this phase is to present a strategy for discovering objective statistical evidence of systems thinking based on the linguistic elements of the DST in an unread corpus of documents. With that goal, we consider statistical semantic characterization of systems thought through a process of supervised learning, term frequency and inverse document frequency (tf-idf), cosine similarity, and naive Bayes classifiers, specifically Rocchio classifiers and quadratic discriminant classification. Finding evidence of systems thinking in unread text through natural language processing establishes a foundation for computationally assessing systems thinking quality in a document or corpus of design-related documents without having to read the subject document or corpus. Once demonstrated, the method can be applied to systems thinking fluency in design-focused documents across a range of application areas, such as transportation, healthcare, and environmental policy. This study demonstrates that capability with a high degree of selectivity. Our approach establishes correlation and allows us to assess the systems thinking quality of a corpus of unread analysis and design studies on life cycle assessment. We show that assigning a prior probability improves that assessment. We posit that quantitative relations between the specific dimensions of systems thinking and a document would be useful for recognizing good systems thinking and improving the quality of systems analyses.

Three variables were measured, Computational Thinking, Visualisation Skills and Geometry Topic achievement. The study was implemented with 124 students in two different schools using quasi-experimental study design. The t-test analysis was performed to see the differences before and after the intervention between the control and treatment groups. Next, a MANCOVA was conducted to see the effectiveness of the intervention in more depth on Computational Thinking, Visualisation Skills and Geometry Topic achievement after controlling for existing knowledge factors. The results show that there is a positive effect of teaching methods using Augmented Reality applications with Computational Thinking for students in the improvement of Computational Thinking, Visualisation Skills and Geometry Topic achievement. Moreover, the results of the MANCOVA show that overall, teaching methods using Augmented Reality applications with Computational Thinking are factors in the improvement of Computational Thinking scores, Visualisation Skills and Geometry Topic achievement, which means the students' existing knowledge did not affect the results of the three dependent variables. In conclusion, this study proposed that the Computational Thinking approach with Augmented Reality application can improve Computational Thinking, Visualisation Skills and Geometry Topic achievement among students.

It develops an avenue to quantify general philosophical and theoretical questions, precisely, inherently spatial basis that produces an unprecedented space-time continuum, in which cyber-enabled relations evolve. Design/methodology/approach Multidisciplinary theoretical approaches are needed to describe complex systems, which in this paper are integrated in a quest for the principles underlying the structural organization and dynamics of cyberspace. A theoretic framework is presented, and the spatial conception of cyber-enabled physical, social, information and thinking spaces and entities existence are provided. Findings With spatial objects and spatial properties, cyberspace is inherently spatial. Its basic constructs are founded on its spatial qualities and producing radical space-time compression, cyber-enabled spaces in which dynamic relations develop and thrive. The cyberspatial object operations are primarily built on foundations that depend on physical space and other spatial metaphors. Information space, basically missing in the literature, is an important part of cyberspace. Research limitations/implications This work suggested a novel analytical approach to describing cyberspace from broader perspectives and fields. Due to the novelty and divergence of cyber concepts, an interdisciplinary study and methodology are needed. Thus, more research toward theoretical direction could help many of the practical implementations of concepts. Practical implications The research is of particular significance in cyberspatial mechanics to describe the dynamics and behavior of cyber physical systems. For example, object-based analysis functions like spatial query, node pattern analysis, cluster analysis, spatial similarity analysis and location modeling. Originality/value Complementing the existing literature and defining information space to the research sphere, a theoretical framework providing a fundamental understanding of cyberspatial objects and the general cyberspace foundation has been proposed, resulting in a formalized concept of existence, interactions and applications and services, with respect to philosophy, science and technology, respectively.

Design process in the urban context - Mobility and health in Special Flood Hazard Area	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Design thinking; Urban areas; Floods; Mobility; Resilience	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESILIENCE; SUSTAINABILITY; THINKING; INTEGRATION; FRAMEWORK	In developing countries, unplanned urban growth, lack of infrastructure services, pollution, diseases, and flooding generate urgent needs. Floods cause diseases and damage to countries at all levels of development because they usually lack the preparedness for current climate variability. In Brazil, Municipal Civil Defense (JMCD) - in a 600,000 inhabitants city-, together with other city agencies, established a safe route (SRP) to be implemented during flood occurrences. This map is available for download as a PDF. This work aims to present the developed methodology, tools, and ways to design, in a collaborative way, a conceptual, innovative system model capable of bringing together needs like resilience, safety and sustainability, contributing to urban resilience, mobility, risks communication and health. Different design processes: design thinking, wayfinding system, signage, norms, and laws were used to create a dynamic conceptual design in the urban development. As a result, visual identity, pictograms icons, totems and luminous panels are presented. Luminous system is projected to be linked to rivers height (measured in hydrological gauging stations) to guide users to safe routes. The information technology which can link water height in rivers, to the different levels of flood in the designed system is not among the objectives of this study. Developing strategies to face the potential effects of climate change in the transportation sector poses a major significant challenge. Proper tools are required to prepare to change and provide meaningful environmental, health, social, and security solutions with the quickness the modern cities demand.

J	Foster, E				Foster, Elizabeth			Cultural Competence in Library Instruction: A Reflective Practice Approach	PORTAL-LIBRARIES AND THE ACADEMY			English	Article								As campuses become more culturally diverse, instruction librarians must work toward developing cultural competence. While the library science literature has discussed cultural competence, no scholars have directly connected it to instruction librarians' teaching. This article discusses literature, models, and best practices from related disciplines and applies them to a customized workflow grounded in reflective practice, the process of thinking about and reflecting on what you do. The workflow identifies opportunities for intentional preparation, instructional design and delivery, assessment, and reflection. By considering cultural competence at each stage of the teaching process, instruction librarians will be better prepared to connect with and teach students from a variety of backgrounds.

J	Ma, J; Liao, I; Ma, KL; Frazier, J				Ma, Joyce; Liao, Isaac; Ma, Kwan-Liu; Frazier, Jennifer			<i>Living Liquid</i>: Design and Evaluation of an Exploratory Visualization Tool for Museum Visitors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS			English	Article						Information visualization; user interaction; evaluation; user studies; science museums; informal learning environments	SCIENCE	Interactive visualizations can allow science museum visitors to explore new worlds by seeing and interacting with scientific data. However, designing interactive visualizations for informal learning environments, such as museums, presents several challenges. First, visualizations must engage visitors on a personal level. Second, visitors often lack the background to interpret visualizations of scientific data. Third, visitors have very limited time at individual exhibits in museums. This paper examines these design considerations through the iterative development and evaluation of an interactive exhibit as a visualization tool that gives museumgoers access to scientific data generated and used by researchers. The exhibit prototype, Living Liquid, encourages visitors to ask and answer their own questions while exploring the time-varying global distribution of simulated marine microbes using a touchscreen interface. Iterative development proceeded through three rounds of formative evaluations using think-aloud protocols and interviews, each round informing a key visualization design decision: (1) what to visualize to initiate inquiry, (2) how to link data at the microscopic scale to global patterns, and (3) how to include additional data that allows visitors to pursue their own questions. Data from visitor evaluations suggests that, when designing visualizations for public audiences, one should (1) avoid distracting visitors from data that they should explore, (2) incorporate background information into the visualization, (3) favor understandability over scientific accuracy, and (4) layer data accessibility to structure inquiry. Lessons learned from this case study add to our growing understanding of how to use visualizations to actively engage learners with scientific data.

J	Martinez, EC				Martinez, EC			Systems thinking and functional modeling of batch process management using projects	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Symposium on Process Systems Engineering	JUL 16-21, 2000	KEYSTONE, CO	CACHE Corp, AICHE, Comp & Syst Techno Div		batch process management; systems thinking; functional modeling		Intense competition and rapid environmental changes are revealing severe limitations in the effectiveness of the hierarchical, stable and Tayloristic management system currently used by the vast majority of batch manufacturing industries. A project-oriented enterprise model of batch plants which results of integrating together systems thinking and functional modeling is proposed here. The latter refers to the set of intents and relationships between goals, functions and components (both physical and abstract) that comprise an analytical viewpoint of batch processes involving product recipes, equipment capabilities, constraints and human competencies (skills and knowledge). Complementarily, the systemic perspective accounts for the organizational setting (roles, objectives and actors), and provides an orthogonal view through the duality of whole-parts relationships and the ubiquitous concepts of boundary, emergence and hierarchy upon which the project-oriented enterprise model is built. A case study that comprises a dairy facility involving the production +100 different fresh products using an order-driven management system will be presented. To support the prototype implementation of a plant information system using a hierarchy of project-based objects, a conceptual design has been developed. The implementation of the resulting enterprise model in Project 98(TM) will be discussed to highlight its easy and cheap implementation, and a number of advantages including: accumulation of information and knowledge, direct tracing of activities and cost analysis.

J	Urgo, K; Arguello, J				Urgo, Kelsey; Arguello, Jaime			Learning assessments in search-as-learning: A survey of prior work and opportunities for future research	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Search as learning; Learning assessment; Interactive information retrieval	SELF-ASSESSMENT; HIGHER-EDUCATION; CLINICAL SKILLS; GENDER; PERFORMANCE; MATHEMATICS; INFORMATION; STRATEGIES; RECOGNIZE; PEER	People often search for information in order to learn something new. In recent years, the "search-as-learning"movement has argued that search systems should be better designed to support learning. Current search systems (especially Web search engines) are largely designed and optimized to fulfill simple look-up tasks (e.g., navigational or fact-finding search tasks). However, they provide less support for searchers working on complex tasks that involve learning. Search-as-learning studies have investigated a wide range of research questions. For example, studies have aimed to better understand how characteristics of the individual searcher, the type of search task, and interactive features provided by the system can influence learning outcomes. Learning assessment is a key component in search-as-learning studies. Assessment materials are used to both gauge prior knowledge and measure learning during or after one or more search sessions. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of different types of assessments used in search-as-learning studies to date. The paper makes the following three contributions. First, we review different types of assessments used and discuss their potential benefits and drawbacks. Second, we review assessments used outside of search-as learning, which may provide insights and opportunities for future research. Third, we provide recommendations for future research. Importantly, we argue that future studies should clearly define learning objectives and develop assessment materials that reliably capture the intended type of learning. For example, assessment materials should test a participant's ability to engage with specific cognitive processes, which may range from simple (e.g., memorization) to more complex (e.g., critical and creative thinking). Additionally, we argue that future studies should consider two dimensions that are understudied in search-as-learning: long-term retention (i.e., being able to use what was learned in the long term) and transfer of learning (i.e., being able to use what was learned in a novel context).

J	Bogomolova, S; Carins, J; Dietrich, T; Bogomolov, T; Dollman, J				Bogomolova, Svetlana; Carins, Julia; Dietrich, Timo; Bogomolov, Timofei; Dollman, James			Encouraging healthier choices in supermarkets: a co-design approach	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING			English	Article						Design thinking; Co-design; Healthy choices; Supermarket	FOOD; CONSUMERS	Purpose This research describes and evaluates the co-creation of a programme called "A Healthy Choice". Underpinned by design thinking (DT), this study aims to improve the healthfulness of food choices in supermarkets among consumers to promote their well-being. Design/methodology/approach The research features two studies. Study 1 included five co-design workshops with consumers and staff (n = 32) to develop a consumer-centred programme. The findings supported the design and implementation of a programme evaluated in Study 2 (an ecological trial). The programme modified a supermarket environment to increase the prominence of healthier products (shelf-talkers and no discount), ran positive food experiences (cooking and label reading workshops) and was supported by a community-wide information campaign in social and local print media. Findings A total of 15 new strategies were developed by consumers and staff to support health and well-being in supermarkets. Feasibility discussions and staff voting contributed to the development and storewide implementation of the programme. Evaluation showed that the programme was effective in increasing consumer knowledge of healthier food choices (measured via public survey). Sales analysis showed mixed results; sales increased for promoted products in some categories, but there was no effect in others. Research limitations/implications Given the real-world setting in which this programme and its evaluation were conducted, there were several innate limitations. The co-design process generated many more ideas than could be implemented, thus creating a healthy "pipe line" for the next iterations of the programme. Practical implications The key contribution of this work to supermarket intervention literature is the recommendation to change the paradigm of engagement between the key stakeholders who are typically involved in supermarket programs. Using the co-design and DT frameworks, the authors offer an example of stakeholders working together in close partnership to co-design and collaboratively implement a programme that promotes healthier choices. Originality/value This project contributes to the emerging body of empirical work using DT principles in the area of healthy food choices in supermarkets. A rigorously designed evaluation of a co-designed supermarket programme contributes to scholarly evidence on food well-being programs in supermarkets.

Therefore, researchers are continuing to explore effective ways to improve and assess it. Makerspaces feature various hands-on activities, which can attract students with diverse interests from different backgrounds. If well designed, scaffolded maker activities have the potential to improve students' CT skills and STEM learning. In this study, we explore ways to improve and assess physics and engineering integrated CT skills through developing maker activities and assessments, which are applicable in both informal and formal educational settings. Our paper presents our work on improving and assessing CT in maker activities with two primary goals. First, it introduces the maker activities and instruments we developed to improve and assess CT that are integrated in physics and engineering learning. Second, it presents the students' CT skill and disposition change from pretest to posttest in two summer academies with CT enhanced maker activities, which was respectively led by after school educators and formal educators in a public library.

Comprehension of the results by participants is not guaranteed in exposure studies. However, information on personal exposure is multiplex, which calls for participant involvement in information design to maximise communication output and comprehension. This study describes and proposes a model of a user-centred design (UCD) approach for preparing a final report for participants involved in a multi-sensor personal exposure monitoring study performed in seven cities within the EU Horizon 2020 ICARUS project. Using a combination of human-centred design (HCD), human-information interaction (HII) and design thinking approaches, we iteratively included participants in the framing and design of the final report. User needs were mapped using a survey (n = 82), and feedback on the draft report was obtained from a focus group (n = 5). User requirements were assessed and validated using a post-campaign survey (n = 31). The UCD research was conducted amongst participants in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the results report was distributed among the participating cities across Europe. The feedback made it clear that the final report was well-received and helped participants better understand the influence of individual behaviours on personal exposure to air pollution.

We analyzed an institutional collection of published papers from 1998 to 2014 authored by researchers from Seoul National University, and their references from papers published between 1998 and 2011. The published papers were collected from Web of Science or Scopus and were analyzed according to the proportion of articles from open access journals. Their cited references from published papers in Web of Science were analyzed according to the proportion of local (South Korean) or open access journals. The proportion of open access papers was relatively stable until 2006 (2.5 similar to 5.2% in Web of Science and 2.7 similar to 4.2% in Scopus), but then increased to 15.9%(Web of Science) or 18.5% (Scopus) in 2014. We analyzed 2,750,485 cited references from 52,295 published papers. We found that the overall proportion of cited articles from local journals was 1.8% and that for open access journals was 3.0%. Citations of open access articles have increased since 2006 to 4.1% in 2011, although the increase in open access article citations was less than for open access publications. The proportion of citations from local journals was even lower. We think that the publishing / citing mismatch is a term to describe this difference, which is an issue at Seoul National University, where the number of published papers at open access or local journals is increasing but the number of citations is not. The cause of this discrepancy is multi-factorial but the governmental / institutional policies, social / cultural issues and authors' citing behaviors will explain the mismatch. However, additional measures are also necessary, such as the development of an institutional citation database and improved search capabilities with respect to local and open access documents.

However, there is yet to be a curriculum model for computational thinking, and many teachers are still figuring out this issue and designing courses to cultivate these skills in students. We planned 8-course periods for 108 curriculums, using the Bebras International Computational Thinking Challenge and programming learning motivation scale to evaluate game-based lessons from Code.org. The grade-3 and -4 students were randomly divided into self-regulation and guided-learning groups, and 153 valid data were analyzed using paired t tests and ANCOVA. As a result, we found the learning behaviors of the two groups of students to be worthy of further exploration in terms of time management and help-seeking learning strategies. Code.org's game-based lessons effectively engage students to complete most of the course, addressing the usual course completion issues when self-paced. The self-regulation group spent more time in peer discussions and had better learning outcomes than the guided-learning group. To this end, we provide detailed curriculum information as a teaching model for the self-regulated learning of computational thinking in primary schools.

J	Cash, DW; Moser, SC				Cash, DW; Moser, SC			Linking global and local scales: designing dynamic assessment and management processes	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						scale; science; information; policy-making; decision-making; assessment	SCIENCE; ECOSYSTEMS; BOUNDARY; POLITICS; ECOLOGY; MODELS; POLICY	This paper identifies challenges inherent in addressing multi-scale environmental problems, and outlines tentative guidelines for addressing such challenges and linking science and policy across scales. The study and practice of environmental assessment and management increasingly recognize the importance of scale and cross-scale dynamics in understanding and addressing global environmental change. These ongoing efforts, however, lack a systematic way of thinking about and addressing the challenges involved in integrating science and policy across multiple scales, for example, in the design of policy-relevant, scientific assessments of problems such as climate change. These challenges include matching scales of biogeophysical systems with scales of management systems, avoiding scale discordance (matching the scale of the assessment with the scale of management), and accounting for cross-scale dynamics. In this paper we propose tentative guidelines for meeting such challenges for both assessors and decisionmakers: (1) utilize boundary organizations - institutions which serve to mediate between scientists and decision-makers, and between these actors at different scales; (2) utilize scale-dependent comparative advantages - coordinating the allocation of resources, technical expertise, and decision-making authority to best capitalize on scale-specific capabilities; and (3) employ adaptive assessment and management strategies - constructing long-term, iterative; experiment-based processes of integrated assessment and management.

Brazil has attempted to answer this call with policies that despite their good intentions have not obtained desired results. DATA-SUS, the Brazilian health information system, operates under policies that seem to be designed without considering the latest discoveries of Information Science regarding the informational nature of humans. This article discusses several information behavior models and theories that must be considered when formulating information policies, and proposes an "Information Field" model containing guideposts for their construction.

A well-designed LTC information system should therefore consider the information requirements of multidisciplinary health care providers to adequately support their care services. Objectives This study proposed a modified service blueprint-the PSD service blueprint-for visualizing interdisciplinary service providers' input and output information requirements, which correspond to their service activities. Methods The PSD service blueprint comprises five layers and seven elements. We also present a case study to illustrate the blueprint's application to daily LTC services. Results Our proposed approach could clearly illustrate the daily care activities, service providers (main actors), actors' input and output information, and suggestions for LTC information system-related applications. Conclusion The proposed PSD service blueprint can not only gather interdisciplinary LTC service providers' information system requirements but also act as a mapping tool for visualizing the care service process.

Think-aloud methods are widely used in studies of cognitive processes, including program comprehension. Alternatively, as in the feedback-collection method (FCM), cognitive processes can be traced by collecting written feedback from the subjects at regular intervals. We compare FCM with concurrent think-aloud (CTA) and retrospective think-aloud (RTA) regarding type and usefulness of the collected information, costs related to analysis of the collected information and effects of the data collection methods on the subjects' performance. FCM allowed us to identify a greater number of comprehension problems that prevented progress or caused significant delay (FCM: 30 problems; CTA: 5; RTA: 15). It was less precise in identifying strategies for comprehension than CTA (92% correctness for FCM; 100% for CTA). FCM was less expensive in analysis (transcription and coding) than the other two methods (FCM: 0.7h of analysis per protocol; CTA: 31h; RTA: 7.9h). The results indicate that all three methods of data collection were intrusive and affected the performance of the subjects with respect to time and correctness (small to medium effect size). This research confirms that FCM can be used beneficially in studies that trace the cognitive processes involved in, and identify problems related to, the comprehension of software applications. On the basis of our experience, we recommend that FCM be used in studies that have a large number of subjects and as a complement to other methods for tracing cognitive processes, such as user log files. We recommend a design with two groups (verbalisation and silent control) and a pretest task to be used in studies with FCM or CTA that focus on performances.

J	Thackray, D; Roberts, L				Thackray, Debbie; Roberts, Lisa			Exploring the clinical decision-making used by experienced cardiorespiratory physiotherapists: A mixed method qualitative design of simulation, video recording and think aloud techniques	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Article						Cardiorespiratory physiotherapists; Clinical decision-making; Think-aloud; Video recording; Simulation	MODEL; STRATEGIES; KNOWLEDGE	Background: The ability of physiotherapists to make clinical decisions is a vital component of being an autonomous practitioner, yet this complex phenomenon has been under-researched in cardiorespiratory physiotherapy. The purpose of this study was to explore clinical decision-making (CDM) by experienced physiotherapists in a scenario of a simulated patient experiencing acute deterioration of their respiratory function. Objectives: The main objective of this observational study was to identify the actions, thoughts, and behaviours used by experienced cardiorespiratory physiotherapists in their clinical decision-making processes. Design: A mixed-methods (qualitative) design employing observation and think-aloud, was adopted using a computerised manikin in a simulated environment. Setting: The participants clinically assessed the manikin programmed with the same clinical signs, under standardised conditions in the clinical skills practice suite, which was set up as a ward environment. Participants: Experienced cardiorespiratory physiotherapists, recruited from clinical practice within a 50-mile radius of the University(*). Methods: Participants were video-recorded throughout the assessment and treatment and asked to verbalise their thought processes using the 'think-aloud' method. The recordings were transcribed verbatim and managed using a Framework approach. Results: Eight cardiorespiratory physiotherapists participated (mean 7 years clinical experience, range 3.5-16 years. CDM was similar to the collaborative hypothetico-deductive model, five-rights nursing model, reasoning strategies, inductive reasoning and pattern recognition. However, the CDM demonstrated by the physiotherapists was complex, interactive and iterative. Information processing occurred continuously throughout the whole interaction with the patient, and the specific cognitive skills of recognition, matching, discriminating, relating, inferring, synthesising and prediction were identified as being used sequentially. Conclusions: The findings from this study were used to develop a new conceptual model of clinical decision-making for cardiorespiratory physiotherapy. This conceptual model can be used to inform future educational strategies to prepare physiotherapists and nurses for working in acute respiratory care.

J	Lou, SH; Feng, YX; Li, ZW; Tan, JR				Lou, Shanhe; Feng, Yixiong; Li, Zhiwu; Tan, Jianrong			Two-additive fuzzy measure-based information integration approach to product design alternative evaluation	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION INTEGRATION			English	Article						Multi-criteria decision-making; Two-additive fuzzy measure; Information integration; Intuitionistic linguistic number	GROUP DECISION-MAKING; CHOQUET; SYSTEM; MCDM; OPERATORS; SELECTION	Conceptual design is a pivotal stage of new product development in manufacturing industries. Since multiple design alternatives are put forward at this stage, developing advanced evaluation methods is of great importance. Existing methods adopt additive models to integrate evaluation data. They face some inconsistency issues, e.g. inconsistency in the independent assumption and interdependent data, since evaluation criteria are interactional. Fuzzy measure that replaces the additivity with monotonicity has enabled advances in addressing such issues. This work proposes a two-additive fuzzy measure-based information integration approach to product design alternative evaluation for the first time. The evaluation data given by experts are in the form of intuitionistic linguistic numbers. They are more in accordance with the thinking habits of experts because the hesitation degree in linguistic assessment can be revealed. In order to reduce the subjective bias, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method combining with grey relational analysis is applied to adjust evaluation data. Then monotonous two-additive fuzzy measure is identified by nonlinear programming using these data. It makes a good trade-off between computational complexity and presentation capability. Hence, evaluation data can be integrated by non-additive Choquet integral for ranking design alternatives. In comparison to additive model based methods, the extra effect on the simultaneous satisfaction of criteria can be effectively revealed by the proposed approach. And the robustness of it is demonstrated by the sensitivity analysis. A case study on an elevator's design alternative evaluation is conducted to illustrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed approach.

In this study, secondary school students' CT performance and their perceptions were examined in terms of certain variables including gender, grade level, achievement and self-efficacy. Casual-comparative and correlational methods were used. The sample of the study consisted of a total of 328 fifth- and sixth-grade (10-12 years old) secondary school students taking visual programming lessons. CT performance and perception tests were employed as data collection tools. The results show that CT performance of boys was higher than that of girls. A significant difference was found in both CT performance and perception depending on grades. The results show that achievement in math positively affected CT performance and perception. However, achievement in IT affected CT performance less than achievement in math. Implications are discussed in terms of theoretical insights, practices for improving CT skills in secondary schools and directions for further research. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Due to the complex structure of computational thinking (CT) in association with computers, cognition, learning and psychology, CT skills should be evaluated from a variety of perspectives. CT performance and perception are considered vital dimensions for comprehensively assessing students' CT skills. What this paper adds This paper proposes a CT performance test and a CT perception scale for secondary school students to explore their skills in terms of certain variables including gender, grade level and achievements in math and information technology (IT) courses. This paper provides some evidence that CT performance of boys is better than that of girls. A significant difference was found in both CT performance and perception depending on grades. The results of the study show that math course achievement positively affected CT performance and perception. However, IT course achievement affected CT performance less than math course achievement. Implications for practice and/or policy CT performance is affected by different variables. Therefore, it may be beneficial to include specific topics in the curriculum that involve the use of more CT skills. Girls' interest and participation in practices such as programming can be encouraged. Teachers should provide students with cognitive scaffolding to help them and to have them collaborate with each other during CT activities, especially at higher grades. IT course content should include systematic and comprehensive CT activities to improve students' CT skills. We suggest developing and implementing a holistic curriculum combined with IT and math lessons to improve students' CT performance.

Broadening the boundaries:: an application of critical systems thinking to IS planning in Colombia	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						autopoiesis; boundary critique; critical systems thinking; ethics of OR; information systems planning; systems methodology	STRATEGY; MANAGEMENT; PLURALISM; SERVICES; FREEDOM; PEOPLE; TSI	Most current information systems ( IS) planning methodologies are focused on achieving plans that provide competitive advantage to business and solve the problems of information needs by using the latest technologies available. This paper presents an alternative approach to IS planning based on critical systems thinking - a research perspective that encourages the analysis of stakeholders' understandings of social contexts prior to the selection and/or design of planning methods. The approach is underpinned by a combination of the systems theories of autopoiesis and boundary critique, and it enables participants to reflect on different concerns and values during IS planning. This approach was applied in a project with a Colombian University, and it helped participants to uncover and address important human issues not usually seen as relevant by traditional approaches to IS planning. In addition, it led the authors to undertake further research on ethics after the project had been concluded.

J	Guo, JY; Luo, JN; An, Y; Xia, TS				Guo, Jiayue; Luo, Jiani; An, Yi; Xia, Tiansheng			tDCS Anodal Stimulation of the Right Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Improves Creative Performance in Real-World Problem Solving	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						tDCS; creativity; right DLPFC; design; convergent thinking; divergent thinking	CONVERGENT; DIVERGENT; THINKING	Brain regions associated with creativity is a focal point in research related to the field of cognitive neuroscience. Previous studies have paid more attention to the role of activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in creativity tasks, which are mostly abstract conceptual tasks, and less attention to real-world creativity tasks. The right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in functions such as visuospatial processing, which may have a positive impact on innovative solutions to real-world problems. In this study, tDCS technology was used to explore the effect of anodal stimulation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on design creativity performance in a real-word problem-solving task related to product design. The experimental task comprised three stages, of which the first two were idea generation stages based on divergent thinking using text and graphics, respectively, whereas the third was the creative evaluation stage based on convergent thinking. Thirty-six design students were recruited to partake in the experiment. They were randomly assigned into anodal stimulation and sham stimulation groups. The results showed that anodal stimulation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex produced a significant positive effect during the creative evaluation stage, promoting the usefulness of ideas (p = 0.009); thus, improving product creativity scores. However, there was no significant impact on the idea generation stage (p > 0.05), which is dominated by divergent thinking. The results suggest that activating the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with tDCS can improve people's performance in creative activities by promoting convergent thinking rather than divergent thinking. It also provides further evidence that the right hemisphere of the brain has an advantage in solving complex problems that require the participation of visuospatial information.

This study aims to improve the efficiency of cluster randomized trials on computer/information literacy and computational thinking. The study employs a two-level hierarchical linear model to estimate (i) intraclass correlation coefficients, (ii) the amount of explained variances given selected predictors, and (iii) minimum detectable effect sizes given the set of plausible scenarios. Two data cycles from the International Computer and Information Study were used. The covariates at the student level are gender, interest in ICT, parents' highest education level, ICT self-efficacy, and experience with computers. The covariates at school/teacher level are teacher's ICT use, ratio of school size to the number of computers for student use, availability of ICT resources at school, approximate teacher age, and ICT self-efficacy. Findings showed that the most precise effect could be measured when student and teacher/school covariates are both adopted. Lastly, it was revealed that increasing the number of schools is effective to get the most precise effect.

J	Barzilai, S				Barzilai, Sarit			"Half-reliable": A qualitative analysis of epistemic thinking in and about a digital game	CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Epistemic thinking; Digital games; Game-based learning	INFORMATION; EXPERIENCE; COGNITION	The purpose of this investigation was to explore if and how players of digital games think about knowledge and knowing in the context of playing a game. Specifically, the objectives of the study were to examine whether players of an educational simulation game engage with epistemic aims, epistemic ideals, and reliable processes in the context of the game and to describe the nature of these aims, ideals, and processes. An exploratory, multiple-case qualitative study design was employed. Adolescent gamers were asked to think aloud while playing a sustainable development simulation game and were subsequently interviewed about the game. The results revealed that players adopted specific epistemic aims, epistemic ideals, and reliable processes in the context of the game. These were related to three layers of knowing: knowing in the game, knowing about playing the game, and knowing about the game as a representational artifact. Although players were adept in achieving epistemic aims related to knowing in the game and knowing about playing the game, they did not spontaneously engage in critical examination of the game as a representation. The study sheds light on challenges of epistemic thinking in digital games and on some of the ways in which game design can support epistemic thinking. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, conventional e-books are mainly designed to provide information in the form of multimedia, implying that students spend most of their time memorizing and comprehending what they read from e-books, while seldom engaging in higher order thinking. In this study, a problem-posing framework is proposed for developing an interactive e-book for guiding students to observe and pose questions. An experiment on an elementary school natural science course was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The participants were 46 fourth-grade students. From the experimental results, it was found that the problem-posing-guiding interactive e-book can significantly improve the students' learning achievements, critical thinking tendency, and deep motive. It was also found that the proposed approach did not increase the students' cognitive load owing to the provision of proper supports during the problem-posing process, which has generally been identified as a challenging task.

J	Brocklehurst, PR; Baker, SR; Langley, J				Brocklehurst, Paul R.; Baker, Sarah R.; Langley, Joe			Context and the evidence-based paradigm: The potential for participatory research and systems thinking in oral health	COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						complexity; evidence-based paradigm; implementation science; participatory research; systems science	INTERVENTIONS; PREVENTION; SERVICES; IMPROVE; SCIENCE; TRIAL	The implementation of research evidence to promote oral health is critical, given the intransigent and emerging challenges for policymakers at a population level. Despite this, little attention has been paid to implementation research within the evidence-based paradigm. This is important as getting research evidence into clinical practice is not a linear path that consists of simple sequential steps. In this article, we argue that we need to consider a broader range of conceptual and methodological approaches to increase the value of information generated. This should be undertaken either in parallel with empirical and experimental designs, or in some cases, instead of. This is important if we are going to understand the complexity and contextual knowledge of the 'system', within which interventions are implemented. Involving key stakeholders alongside empirical and experimental designs is one helpful approach. Examples of these approaches include Patient and Public Involvement and the development of Core Outcome Sets, where the views of those that will be potentially affected by the research, are included. The use of theoretical frameworks and process evaluations alongside trials are also important, if they are fully integrated into the approach taken to address the research question. A more radical approach is using participatory designs and 'systems thinking'. Participatory approaches include subject matter 'experts by experience'. These include patients, their families, carers, healthcare professionals, services managers, policymakers, commissioners and researchers. Participatory approaches raise important questions about who facilitates the process, when it should happen and how the diverse actors become meaningfully engaged so that their involvement is active, democratic and ongoing. We argue that the issues of control, power and language are central to this and represent a paradigmatic shift to conventional approaches. Systems thinking captures the idea that public health problems commonly involve multiple interdependent and interconnected factors, which interact with each other dynamically. This approach challenges the simplicity of the hierarchy of evidence and linear sequential logic, when it does not account for context. In contrast, systems thinking accepts complexity de novo and emphasizes the need to understand the whole system rather than its individual component parts. We conclude with the idea that participatory and systems thinking help to unpack the diverse agents that are often involved in the generation and translation of evidence into clinical dental practice. It moves our conception of research away from a simple exchange between 'knowledge producers' and 'knowledge users' and raises both methodological and epistemological challenges.

J	Westerdahl, F; Carlson, E; Wennick, A; Borglin, G				Westerdahl, Frida; Carlson, Elisabeth; Wennick, Anne; Borglin, Gunilla			Teaching strategies and outcome assessments targeting critical thinking in bachelor nursing students: a scoping review protocol	BMJ OPEN			English	Review						critical thinking abilities; critical thinking skills; descriptive numerical analysis; nurse educators; thematic analysis	ETHICS	Introduction Applying critical thinking is essential for nursing students both in an academic and clinical context. Particularly, as critical thinking is a vital part of nurses' everyday problem-solving and decision-making processes. Therefore, regardless of the topic taught or the setting in which it is taught, it requires teaching strategies especially targeting students' critical thinking skills and abilities. One challenge with the latter is the difficulties to assess and evaluate the impact of such teaching strategies on the students' critical thinking disposition. Hence, our objective will be to review published literature on; existing teaching strategies and outcomes assessments targeting nursing students' critical thinking skills and abilities. Methods and analysis Our scoping review will be conducted in accordance with Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping studies. Search strategies will be developed in cooperation with an experienced librarian, and adjusted to each individual database for example, CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, ERIC and ERC. A preliminary search in CINAHL was conducted on the 17(th) of July 2019. Peer-reviewed published studies conducted with a qualitative, quantitative or mixed method design and focussing our objectives, will be eligible for inclusion. Included studies will be quality assessed in accordance with their study design. Data will be charted using a standardised extraction form. The qualitative data will be presented through a thematic analyses, and the quantitative data by descriptive numerical analysis. Lastly, nurse educators and nursing students will be consulted for validation of the findings from the scoping review.

"I Think You Think I Think You're Lying": The Interactive Epistemology of Trust in Social Networks	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						organizational studies; strategy; networks graphs; theory; design; information; philosophy of modeling	COMMON KNOWLEDGE; COORDINATION; COOPERATION; EVOLUTION	We investigate the epistemology of trust in social networks. We posit trust as a special epistemic state that depends on actors' beliefs about each others' beliefs as well as about states of the world. It offers new ideas and tools for representing the core elements of trust both within dyads and larger groups and presents an approach that makes trust measurable in a noncircular and predictive, rather than merely postdictive, fashion. After advancing arguments for the importance of interactive belief systems to the successful coordination of behavior, we tune our investigation of trust by focusing on beliefs that are important to mobilization and coordination and show how trust functions to influence social capital arising from network structure. We present empirical evidence corroborating the importance of higher-order beliefs to understanding trust and the interactive analysis of trust to the likelihood of successful coordination.

However, most existing games have focused on the theoretical knowledge of computational thinking, ignoring the development of computational thinking skills. Moreover, there is a lack of integration of adaptivity into educational computer games for computational thinking, which is crucial to addressing individual needs in developing computational thinking skills. In this study, we present an adaptive educational computer game, called AutoThinking, for developing students' computational thinking skills in addition to their conceptual knowledge. To evaluate the effects of the game, we conducted an experimental study with 79 elementary school students in Estonia, where the experimental group learned with AutoThinking, while the control group used a traditional technology-enhanced learning approach. Our findings show that learning with the adaptive educational computer game significantly improved students' computational thinking related to both conceptual knowledge and skills. Moreover, students using the adaptive educational computer game showed a significantly higher level of interest, satisfaction, flow state, and technology acceptance in learning computational thinking. Implications of the findings are also discussed.

To characterize the nonequilibrium strategic thinking, we construct a mathematical model that incorporates the "level-k decision rule" to iteratively derive closed-form solutions. Then the effects of bidders' heterogeneous beliefs of thinking levels on their bid prices and expected payoffs are investigated. We find that under some assumptions, bidders will exhibit oscillating behavior in their bid prices and expected profits in terms of thinking levels. When the thinking level tends to infinity, the bid prices and expected profits converge to those in the conventional analysis with perfectly rational bidders. An interesting finding from theoretical analysis verified by numerical experiments is that any bidder with a thinking level above two should bid according to level-2 bidder's strategy to achieve the highest expected profit, and in this case the buyer will pay no more than level-2 bidder's bid price.

It is seen that the proposed classifier has no parameters to be determined via mathematical optimization. Instead, it is built by using the correlation principles to construct the clusters at first. The middle-level feature vectors can then be extracted from the statistical information of the correlations between the input data and the ones in each pattern cluster. For accurate classification purpose, the advanced feature vectors are generated with the moments' information of the middle-level feature vectors. After that, Bayesian inference is implemented to make decisions from the weighted sum of the advanced feature components. In addition, a real-time fine-tuning loop (layer) is designed to adaptively "widen" the border of each pattern clustering region such that the input data can be directly classified once they are located in one of the clustering regions. An experiment for the classification of the handwritten digit images from the MNIST database is performed to show the excellent performance and effectiveness of the proposed intelligent pattern classifier.

In the proposed theoretical framework, three eudaemonic factors, namely perceived utility, curiosity, and superior influence, were adapted as external stimuli. Moreover, individuals' cognitive absorption and reflective thinking were set as mediators, while the traits of openness and digital literacy were set as moderators. A total of 463 school students (grades 9/10, M = 284, F = 179) participated in the designed experiment based on a personal computer-based immersive environment. Then, the students were asked to complete a perceived utility scale, superior influence scale, curiosity and cognitive ab-sorption scale, reflective thinking scale, digital literacy and trait of openness scale. The results demonstrated that eudaemonic factors positively influence students' cognition (cognitive ab-sorption and reflective thinking) and learners' intention to continue to use VR for learning. Notably, individuals' digital literacy and openness traits significantly moderate personal reflec-tive thinking in an immersive environment. In this study, we illustrated the conceptual view of learners' intention to continue using VR for learning, which has theoretical and practical impli-cations for educators, researchers, and policy-makers.

Design/methodology/approach - The main research methods used in this paper are the literature review and the comparative study. On the one hand, it reviews some related concepts and theories in Kun Wu's academic works of philosophy of information. On the other hand, it compares the thoughts and viewpoints of Kun Wu with those of other scholars. Findings - First, Kun Wu is the first person who has established a complete and comprehensive theoretical system of philosophy of information in China; second, Kun Wu's philosophy of information is significant in originality and value, which could be thought as the intellectual quintessence of information age, thus worth learning. Third, with more international exchanges, Chinese philosophy of information created by Wu will surely be more and more influential in philosophical circles at home and abroad. Originality/value - It is a very valuable first-hand material for Western scholars to know and understand Chinese philosophy of information.

The overall approach focuses on understanding the processes involved in the decision making and reasoning of health care workers, both with and without the use of information technologies. The issue of developing appropriate evaluation tools, for use in the design and analysis of medical information systems is considered to be of great importance. However, conventional methods are limited in their ability to identify and characterize the effects of information technology on the cognitive processes involved in decision making and reasoning. In this paper a range of methods are described involving video recording for collecting data on the use of information systems. The techniques described allow for the collection of an integrated data set consisting of transcripts of health care workers as they 'think aloud' in interacting with a medical system, along with complete video records of user-computer interaction. In addition, the methods can be extended to allow for the collection of process data from video recording of systems in actual clinical and emergency situations. The use bf a variety of approaches, borrowing from research in cognitive science, is discussed. The development and application of these evaluation methods within the Canadian Centres of Excellence network HEALNet is subsequently described. Finally, implications for the development and evaluation of medical information systems are considered. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Barriers include therapy being insufficiently usable and useful for a diverse range of people. User-centered, inclusive design approaches could improve the usability of therapy, which may increase uptake, adherence, and effectiveness. Objective: This study aimed to optimize the usability of an existing psychological intervention, Thinking Well, which targets reasoning processes in paranoia using a basic digital interface. Methods: We conducted inclusive, user-centered design research characterized by purposive sampling of extreme users from the margins of groups, ethnographic investigation of the problem context, and iterative prototyping of solutions. The UK Design Council's double diamond method was used. This consisted of 4 phases: discover, including a case series of Thinking Well, stakeholder interviews, desk research, user profiling, system mapping, and a mood board; define, consisting of workshops to synthesize findings and generate the design brief; develop, involving concept workshops and prototype testing; and deliver, in which the final minimal viable product was storyboarded and iteratively coded. Results: Consistent with our previous work, the Thinking Well case series showed medium to large effects on paranoia and well-being and small effects on reasoning. These were maintained at follow-up despite some participants reporting difficulties with the therapy interface. Insights from the discover phase confirmed that usability was challenged by information complexity and poor accessibility. Participants were generally positive about the potential of technology to be enjoyable, help manage paranoia, and provide tailored interpersonal support from therapists and peers, although they reported privacy and security concerns. The define phase highlighted that the therapy redesign should support monitoring, simplify information processing, enhance enjoyment and trust, promote personalization and normalization, and offer flexible interpersonal support. During the develop phase over 60 concepts were created, with 2 key concepts of thoughts visualized as bubbles and therapy as a journey selected for storyboarding. The output of the deliver phase was a minimal viable product of an innovative digital therapy, SlowMo. SlowMo works by helping people to notice their worries and fast thinking habits, and encourages them to slow down for a moment to find ways of feeling safer. A Web app supports the delivery of 8 face-to-face sessions, which are synchronized to a native mobile app. Conclusions: SlowMo makes use of personalization, ambient information, and visual metaphors to tailor the appeal, engagement, and memorability of therapy to a diversity of needs. Feasibility testing has been promising, and the efficacy of SlowMo therapy is now being tested in a multicentered randomized controlled trial. The study demonstrates that developments in psychological theory and techniques can be enhanced by improving the usability of the therapy interface to optimize its impact in daily life.

Pharmaceutical researchers can now choose from technologies that, in addition to traditional high-throughput knowledge-based and diversity screening, now include the screening of fragment and fragment-like libraries, affinity selection mass spectrometry, and selection against DNA-encoded libraries (DELs). Each of these techniques has its own unique combination of advantages and limitations that makes them more, or less, suitable for different target classes or discovery objectives, such as desired mechanism of action. Layered on top of this are the constraints of the drug-hunters themselves, including budgets, timelines, and available platform capacity; each of these can play a part in dictating the hit identification strategy for a discovery program. In this article, we discuss some of the factors that we use to govern our building of a hit identification roadmap for a program and describe the increasing role that DELs are playing in our discovery strategy. Furthermore, we share our learning during our initial exploration of DEL and highlight the approaches we have evolved to maximize the value returned from DEL selections. Topics addressed include the optimization of library design and production, reagent validation, data analysis, and hit confirmation. We describe how our thinking in these areas has led us to build a DEL platform that has begun to deliver tractable matter to our global discovery portfolio.

Two design conditions (symbolic vs non-symbolic) were used to evaluate users' ability to locate a place of interest. Design/methodology/approach A total of 19 students (10 male and 9 female, 20-23 years old) participated in this study. The time required for subjects to find a place in the two conditions was used to estimate their searching performance. An electroencephalogram (EEG) device was used to examine students' cognitive load using event-related desynchronization percentages of alpha, beta and theta brain wave rhythms. Findings The results showed that subjects needed more time to find a place in the non-symbolic condition than the symbolic condition. The EEG data, however, revealed that users experienced higher cognitive load when searching for a place in the symbolic condition. The authors found that the design characteristics of the map significantly influenced users' brain activity, thus impacting their search performance. Originality/value Outcomes from this study can be used by cartographic designers and scholars to understand how certain design characteristics can trigger cognitive activity to improve users' searching experience and efficiency.

It is being done as the contribution to the information service of the Commonwealth of Learning, with a particular aim of providing help to the developing countries in planning and preparing distance education programmes and courses. Coverage of courses and programmes is currently Commonwealth wide but the institutions and literature databases are world-wide in scope. ICDL makes the database available as an online service, updated monthly, and as a CD-ROM, updated every four months. The CD-ROM option was thought more likely to be useful in the developing countries where telecommunications and access to networks is more difficult. This paper describes the design restrictions that have been placed on the database to allow for dual mode of presentation, accessible to both the sophisticated networks of the developed world and the more limited technology available in the third world. Search simplicity has been an initial criterion to allow for a wide range of user skills, but pressure of user demand has suggested a need for more features to be incorporated during the current, second phase of development. A balance has had to be found that will give service back both to users who can provide data for the database via e-mail and file transfer and those for whom it is difficult to provide documents and course descriptions typed up on ancient typewriters. Some of the problems that have been faced, solutions adopted and intentions for future development are outlined. This includes a wish to incorporate as many full text literature entries as possible, with the aim of making the database into a freestanding electronic library of distance education materials.

J	Lukyanenko, R; Storey, VC; Pastor, O				Lukyanenko, Roman; Storey, Veda C.; Pastor, Oscar			Conceptual modelling for life sciences based on systemist foundations	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Systemist perspective; Systems; Life sciences; Conceptual modelling; Systems modelling; System composition diagram	BIG DATA; DESIGN; CHALLENGES; ONTOLOGY; GENOME; GAME	BackgroundAll aspects of our society, including the life sciences, need a mechanism for people working within them to represent the concepts they employ to carry out their research. For the information systems being designed and developed to support researchers and scientists in conducting their work, conceptual models of the relevant domains are usually designed as both blueprints for a system being developed and as a means of communication between the designer and developer. Most conceptual modelling concepts are generic in the sense that they are applied with the same understanding across many applications. Problems in the life sciences, however, are especially complex and important, because they deal with humans, their well-being, and their interactions with the environment as well as other organisms.ResultsThis work proposes a "systemist" perspective for creating a conceptual model of a life scientist's problem. We introduce the notion of a system and then show how it can be applied to the development of an information system for handling genomic-related information. We extend our discussion to show how the proposed systemist perspective can support the modelling of precision medicine.ConclusionThis research recognizes challenges in life sciences research of how to model problems to better represent the connections between physical and digital worlds. We propose a new notation that explicitly incorporates systemist thinking, as well as the components of systems based on recent ontological foundations. The new notation captures important semantics in the domain of life sciences. It may be used to facilitate understanding, communication and problem-solving more broadly. We also provide a precise, sound, ontologically supported characterization of the term "system," as a basic construct for conceptual modelling in life sciences.

J	Borge, M; Ong, YS; Rosé, CP				Borge, Marcela; Ong, Yann Shiou; Rose, Carolyn Penstein			Learning to monitor and regulate collective thinking processes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-SUPPORTED COLLABORATIVE LEARNING			English	Article						Assessment; Collective regulation; Discussion quality; Online collaboration; Online learning; Socio-metacognition; System design	ARGUMENTATIVE KNOWLEDGE CONSTRUCTION; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; ENGINEERING DESIGN; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; EMOTION; FEEDBACK; STUDENTS; SCRIPT; TEAMS	In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework to guide the design of a computer-supported collaborative learning intervention to help students learn how to improve collaborative knowledge building discourse at the level of the small group. The framework focuses on scripting individual and collective regulatory processes following collaboration. Individuals are required to evaluate their team's chat transcripts against rubrics to score discussion quality. These theoretically supported rubrics provide individuals with concrete examples of desired communication processes. After this individual assessment, the team is prompted to discuss their individual scores, identify strengths and weaknesses of their collaborative discourse processes, and select strategies to improve the quality of their collaborative discussion in a future discussion session. To evaluate our framework, we created a prototype of an online system and asked students to use it over ten weeks as part of five discussion sessions. Participants included 37 students, divided into 13 teams, from an undergraduate online course in information sciences. We used quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques to examine students' collaborative processes over time, with teams as the main unit of analysis. All teams followed the same general activities, but there were two different conditions for scripting individual reflections that preceded the collective sense-making activity: one (Future-thinking) focused on pushing individuals to pay attention to advice on how to improve existing processes in future sessions and another (Evidence-Based) pushed individuals to pay closer attention to the chat transcripts to provide evidence for their group process scores. Our results suggest (1) use of the framework can help students' monitor and regulate collaborative processes and improve collaborative discourse over time and (2) the Evidence-Based condition can help students engage in higher quality reflective analysis.

The impending strict regulatory framework, particularly in terms of the environmental dimensions of sustainability development (SD), is single-handedly opening the door to rapid and potentially disruptive change. The research literature on SSCM has increased exponentially over the last decade to meet the mounting demand for information on how to tackle often conflicting sustainability-related requirements while satisfying all internal and external stakeholders. Due to the continuously evolving and wicked nature of SSCM, a limited number of scholars have approached the issue with design thinking problem solving methodologies (DTPSMs). The results of a systematic literature review (SLR) were mirrored with the Evolved Double Diamond (EDD) design process model to formulate a design thinking overview and trace potential research gaps of selected frameworks and models regarding the sustainability transition (ST) of supply chains (SCs). The research results demonstrate that modelling the ST in SC as a wicked problem can contribute to the creation of more structured and novel SSCM models and frameworks, which take into deeper consideration the evolving nature of the issue and improve facilitation practices of stakeholder engagement.

J	Benyon, D				Benyon, D			The new HCI? navigation of information space	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual ACM CHI Conference	APR, 2000	THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS	ACM		human-computer interaction paradigms; navigation; information space	MODELS	When we use the term `human-computer interaction' (HCI), the image that is conjured up is of a person sitting at a visual display unit staring in at the world of 'information'; the person is very much outside the space of information. But when we think of other activities such as going shopping, having a meeting or driving across town, we do not think of the person as outside this space. On the contrary, we see the person as inside a space of activities, surrounded by, and interacting with, assorted artefacts and people. Navigation of Information Space is an alternative conceptualisation of HCI that sees people as existing inside information spaces. Looking at HCI in this way means looking at HCI design as the creation of information spaces. This paper explores these ideas in more detail, arguing that Navigation of Information Space is not just a metaphor for HCI; it is a 'paradigm shift'. The paper illustrates how Semiotics has informed this conception and discusses why such a paradigm shift is needed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The purpose of the BDC ("Big Idea, Divergent Thinking, and Convergent Thinking") instructional model is to to scaffold students' inquiry learning. We illustrate the use of this model with an example lesson, designed to help 5th-grade students understand the concept of plant growth. The BDC model functions as an exploration of, and a connection with, related information among students' scientific knowledge, skills, and practice, so that students can further generate research ideas. Students are able to more easily formulate testable questions and are also highly motivated throughout the course of their inquiry practice. This instructional model provides teachers with a practical and meaningful tool, one that increases students' capabilities to formulate researchable questions and sustains their motivation to engage in activities of scientific and creative inquiry.

Desire thinking as a predictor of craving and binge drinking: A longitudinal study	ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Article						Alcohol use; Binge drinking; Craving; Desire thinking; Metacognitive model	ELABORATED INTRUSION THEORY; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPMENT; ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS; MENTAL-IMAGERY; METACOGNITIONS; DISORDER; DRUG	Desire thinking is a conscious and voluntary cognitive process orienting to prefigure images, information and memories about positive target-related experience. Desire thinking has been found to be associated with both craving and alcohol use in clinical and non-clinical populations, however its role in predicting craving and problematic drinking patterns has never been investigated using a longitudinal design. The central aim of the present study was to explore the role of desire thinking at Time 2 (3 months post-baseline) in predicting craving and binge drinking and Time 3 (6 months post-baseline), controlling for levels of both these constructs and Time 1 (baseline). One hundred and thirty three non-hazardous drinkers were assessed on craving and binge drinking at Times 1 and 3, and on desire thinking at Time 2. Findings showed that desire thinking at Time 2 predicted craving and binge drinking at Time 3, controlling for craving and binge drinking at Time 1. Furthermore, the imaginal prefiguration component of desire thinking at Time 2 was found to mediate the relationship between craving at Times 1 and 3; conversely the verbal perseveration component of desire thinking at Time 2 was found to mediate the relationship between binge drinking at Times 1 and 3. The implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Assessing students' ability in performing scientific inquiry: instruments for measuring science skills in primary education	RESEARCH IN SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Scientific inquiry; performance assessment; primary education; science skills	HIGHER-ORDER THINKING; HANDS-ON; METACOGNITION; ACHIEVEMENT; CHILDREN; INTELLIGENCE; RATIONALE; KNOWLEDGE	Background With the increased attention on the implementation of inquiry activities in primary science classrooms, a growing interest has emerged in assessing students' science skills. Research has thus far been concerned with the limitations and advantages of different test formats to assess students' science skills.Purpose This study explores the construction of different instruments for measuring science skills by categorizing items systematically on three subskill levels (science-specific, thinking, metacognition) as well as on different steps of the empirical cycle.Sample The study included 128 fifth and sixth grade students from seven primary schools in the Netherlands.Design and method Seven measures were used: a paper-and-pencil test (PPT), three performance assessments, two metacognitive self-report tests, and a test used as an indication of general cognitive ability.Results Reliabilities of all tests indicate sufficient internal consistency. Positive correlations between the PPT and the three performance assessments show that the different tests measure a common core of similar skills thus providing evidence for convergent validity. Results also show that students' ability to perform scientific inquiry is significantly related to general cognitive ability. No relationship was found between the measure of general metacognitive ability and either the PPT or the three performance assessments. By contrast, the metacognitive self-report test constructed to obtain information about the application of metacognitive abilities in performing scientific inquiry, shows significant - although small - correlations with two of the performance assessments. Further explorations reveal sufficient scale reliabilities on subskill and step level.Conclusions The present study shows that science skills can be measured reliably by categorizing items on subskill and step level. Additional diagnostic information can be obtained by examining mean scores on both subskill and step level. Such measures are not only suitable for assessing students' mastery of science skills but can also provide teachers with diagnostic information to adapt their instructions and foster the learning process of their students.

It also has been determined students' experiences and teachers' opinions regarding process. This study has based on mixed research method. Participants has consisted of 60 fourth grade students and three teachers. One-group pre-experimental design has used to compare students' pre-test and post-test averages of achievement, spatial visualization and mental rotation, and also their weekly cognitive load levels. Moreover, it has employed case study to reveal students' experiences in relation to learning process and to obtain teachers' opinions on using Google Earth in social science education. As data collection instruments, has used achievement, spatial visualization, mental rotation tests, cognitive load scale, teacher and student interview guides, and student observation form. Descriptive and inferential statistical methods, paired sample t-test and repeated measures ANOVA, have used to analysis the quantitative data. Qualitative data has analyzed by content analysis. According to results, using Google Earth has significantly effects on students' achievements and mental rotation skills positively whereas it has not an effect on their spatial visualization skills. Although students have high cognitive load levels in each week, most of them has been able to perform Google Earth tasks successfully. The positive opinions of teachers about Google Earth will encourage primary school teachers to use three-dimensional geospatial technologies in social science education.

In this study, morphological analysis was used as a tool to develop design proposals and eye tracking technology was applied to track the attention. The feature of thinking activities in problem-solving between two groups (novice and expert) was analyzed by Heat map and Gaze plot in qualitative, and measured by indicators such as fixation and saccade in quantitative. Findings suggested that, i) Experts showed more fixation duration and fixation numbers in thinking activities, and the attention containing more AOIs was positively related to the rationality of the scheme. ii) Saccades with greater amplitude were more beneficial to the novelty of scheme. iii) Experts considered the information of each block in a balanced way, while novices tended to ignore unimportant blocks. These results will have a far-reaching impact on the development of designers' thinking and help novices to exercise creative thinking and produce high-quality designs.

A head-to-tail cyclic hexapeptide library based on UT-II sequence was designed, synthesized, and evaluated by the activity on the UT-II receptor (GPR-14). A new synthetic sequence, WK[Xaa] (Xaa: amino acid with aromatic side chain), was identified as a characteristic minimum fragment activating hUT-II receptor instead of the WK[Y] sequence. Compound 1 showed an agonistic activity with an EC50 value of 6.94 nM. The conformational investigation suggested that 1 did not have typical secondary structure in the message sequence. Structural analyses may enable us to investigate the active conformation of UT-II and lead to the identification of new ligands for GPR-14. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Michael			User-Centered Design to Reduce Inappropriate Blood Transfusion Orders	APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						user-centered design; think aloud; nudge; EHR; user experience; transfusion	COSTS	Background To improve blood transfusion practices, we applied user-centered design (UCD) to evaluate potential changes to blood transfusion orders.Objectives The aim of the study is to build effective transfusion orders with different designs to improve guideline adherence.Methods We developed three different versions of transfusion orders that varied how information was presented to clinicians ordering blood transfusions. We engaged 14 clinicians (residents, advanced practice providers [APPs], and attending physicians) from different specialties. We used the think aloud technique and rapid qualitative analysis to generate themes to incorporate into our modified orders.Results Most end-users who participated in the semi-structured interviews preferred the interruptive alert design plus behavioral nudges ( n = 8/14, 57%). The predominant rationale was that the in-line alert was not visually effective in capturing the end-user's attention, while the interruptive alert forced a brief stop in the workflow to consider the guidelines. All users supported the general improvements, though for different reasons, and as a result, the general improvements remained in the designs for the forthcoming trial.Conclusion The user experience uncovered through the think aloud approach produced a clear and rich understanding of potentially confounding factors in the initial design of different intervention versions. Input from end-users guided the creation of all three designs so each was addressing human factors with parity, which ensured that the results of our study reflected differences in interruptive properties of the alerts and not differences in design.

Through document analysis and semi-structured interviews, we investigated the types of contextual factors incorporated by novice engineering designers and their approaches during design processes. Our findings demonstrated that participants primarily considered technical and institutional contextual factors across all design stages, informed largely by contextual observations and interviews with stakeholders. Socio-political contextual factors were less frequently considered. We also found that a broader set of contextual factors were incorporated when projects were set in unfamiliar contexts. And, contextual factors that could be easily quantified were more readily applied to design decisions. We suggest that there are opportunities for more intentional approaches to incorporating contextual factors throughout design processes.

However, there is limited understanding of longitudinal effects of concept map teaching on students' critical thinking. The purpose of the study was to investigate the growth and the other factors influencing the development of critical thinking in response to concept map as an interventional strategy for nursing students in a two-year registered nurse baccalaureate program. The study was a quasi-experimental and longitudinal follow-up design. A convenience sample was drawn from a university in central Taiwan. Data were collected at different time points at the beginning of each semester using structured questionnaires including Critical Thinking Scale and Approaches to Learning and Studying. The intervention of concept map teaching was given at the second semester in the Medical-Surgical Nursing course. The results of the findings revealed student started with a mean critical thinking score of 41.32 and decreased at a rate of 0.42 overtime, although not significant. After controlling for individual characteristics, the final model revealed that the experimental group gained a higher critical thinking score across time than the control group. The best predictive variables of initial status in critical thinking were without clinical experience and a higher pre-test score. The growth in critical thinking was predicted best by a lower pre-test score, and lower scores on surface approach and organized study. Our study suggested that concept map is a useful teaching strategy to enhance student critical thinking. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We also examine gender differences in learning outcomes. The program was developed through a school-university partnership. Data were collected from 138 students over a 2.5-year period. Data sources included pre-post content assessments of computational concepts related to programming in addition to computational artifacts and interviews with a purposeful sample of 12 participants. Quantitative data were analyzed using statistical methods to identify gains in pre- and post-learning of computational thinking concepts and examine potential gender differences. Interview data were analyzed qualitatively. Results indicated that students made significant gains in their learning of computational thinking concepts and that gains persisted over time. Results also revealed differences in learning of computational thinking concepts among boys and girls both at the beginning and end of the program. Finally, results from student interviews provided insights into the development of computational thinking practices and perspectives over time. Results have implications for the design of after-school computing programs that help broaden participation in computing.

A RESEARCH FOR BASIC ASTRONOMY KNOWLEDGE LEVEL OF SCIENCE TEACHERS	OXIDATION COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						astronomy knowledge level; astronomy education; knowledge test; science teachers		Astronomy, which contains many science disciplines within itself, is used for acquiring information on the concept level and making people love science all over the world. In this study, the determination of science teachers knowledge in the basic astronomy subjects is aimed at. An astronomy knowledge test has been developed in order to determine the knowledge level of the teachers. The study was designed as descriptive model and mixed method that combines quantity and quality researches were used. According to the findings, at the end of the study, it has been seen that the teachers lack the basic astronomical subjects such as Solar System, Moon tilt of orbit, axial tilt of the Earth, Lunar and Solar eclipse, astronomy unit and light year as well as the subjects like concretion of an event in their minds, relation of cause and effect and three dimensional thinking. Also, in terms of final results, it turned out to be that the teachers interest in the astronomical subjects is so low and they know the book information but they are not successful at relating this information with each other and their cause and effects.

Most of the studies focused on designing technological-rich learning environments which usually take several weeks or months to implement. However, the occurring of COVID-19 health crisis does not allow extensive period of time to implement classroom interventions. How to support students' systems thinking in fully online environments remains an issue. This study examines if encouraging students initiating questions on asynchronous discussion forum supports their systems thinking development. MethodsTwenty-two junior students participated in this study. We compared if and how students developed systems thinking when they were encouraged asking questions in asynchronous discussion forums in one unit with another unit in which traditional method was used. Multiple analytical methods were applied in this study, including, social network analysis, epistemic network analysis, inferential statistical analysis and qualitative analysis. ResultsQuantitative results showed that all students improved systems thinking compared with traditional teaching unit among which leader students improved most. Further analysis on students' discussion posts suggested leader students asked high systems thinking level questions and provided high level responses. Epistemic network analysis unpacked how leader, regular and peripheral students engaged in initiating questions and providing responses differently. DiscussionThis study provides methodological and practical contributions. Methodologically, this study extends prior methods of applying network analysis beyond its original preservice teacher training contexts; practically, this study provides strategies to practitioners to support students' asynchronous forum discussions.

J	Wang, CY; Gao, BL; Chen, SJ				Wang, Cui-Yu; Gao, Bao-Lian; Chen, Shu-Jie			The effects of metacognitive scaffolding of project-based learning environments on students' metacognitive ability and computational thinking	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Early Access						Computational thinking; Metacognition; Metacognitive scaffolding; Computational thinking assessment; Problem-solving	DESIGN; DECADE; K-12	How to develop students' computational thinking (CT) is an important topic faced by academics and front-line teachers. However, the solution of programming problems requires paying attention to every detail of the problem and building a solution to the problem step by step, and for beginners, they often get stuck when one of these aspects goes wrong because of the lack of metacognitive abilities. The integration of metacognitive scaffolding in project-based programming instruction can help students identify their strengths, become more aware of their learning status and identify problems in a timely manner. Therefore, this study designed a metacognitive scaffolding in four aspects: planning, monitoring, reflecting and evaluating, and assessed the effects of this scaffolding on students' CT, learning achievement and metacognitive abilities through a quasi-experimental design. The participants were 70 students aged 9-11 years in elementary school, where the experimental group (38 students) used a metacognitive scaffolding-based project-based learning approach, while the control group (32 students) used a traditional project-based learning approach. The results indicate that metacognitive scaffolding has a facilitative effect in helping students improve their CT and learning achievement, but does not significantly improve metacognitive abilities. This study provides insights into the deeper development of students' CT development and metacognitive scaffolding design.

J	Lee, YS; Cho, JW				Lee, Youngseok; Cho, Jungwon			Knowledge representation for computational thinking using knowledge discovery computing	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge representation; Knowledge discovery; Problem solving; Computational thinking; Knowledge-based tutoring system	ROBOTICS; SUPPORT	Modern society needs to think of new approaches for solving problems with computing. Computational thinking is the process of abstracting and automating a variety of problems using computational technology. A system that expresses, manages, and processes knowledge such as computational thinking is called a knowledge-based system. This paper proposes to examine students' knowledge about computational thinking when they want to develop a Python project, and the correlation/association between these concepts. To achieve our goal, a field study was designed and data were collected from a computer programming lecture. Through this data analysis, we try to identify the factors through the correlation between data and clustering technique in order to express and discover the knowledge about the learner's computational thinking. For the verification of the factors identified, we analyzed the correlation between computational thinking and the pre- and post-test results of the LightBot. In addition to the regression analysis of the proven factors, the probability of the research model was analyzed through the structural equation to process the knowledge discovered. In this paper, we present various problems in the domain of programming education and analyze the means to diagnose and improve knowledge based on computational thinking by finding various problem-solving methods. To pre-examine the learner; he/she was diagnosed using a test paper and the LightBot execution test. We checked the learner's current knowledge state by analyzing the correlation between the test site and the results of the LightBot. To analyze the level of knowledge improvement of learners, we designed an experiment to analyze the correlation between learning and the actual test results through a system that applied the problem-solving learning method. An analysis of the experimental results demonstrated that there was a correlation between the test results for a learner and the pre-test results of the LightBot. Additionally, the group mean scores of the learners who learned as per the proposed technique were observed to be significant. During this process, we analyzed the effects of problem-solving and system application on academic achievement through factor analysis, regression analysis, and structural equation modeling. The ability to pinpoint various problem scenarios and solve problems more effectively using computational technologies will become more important in future. For this purpose, applying our proposed technique for deriving and improving knowledge based on computational thinking to software education will induce the interest of students and increase the learning effect.

Engineering graduate students (n = 30) completed three concept generation tasks using techniques with different levels of structuredness: brainstorming, morphological analysis, and TRIZ. Students' brain activation in their prefrontal cortex (PFC) was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The temporal dynamic of central regions in brain networks were compared between tasks. Central regions facilitate functional interaction and imply information flow through the brain. A consistent central region appears in the medial PFC. Consistent network connections occurred across both hemispheres suggesting a concurrent dual processing of divergent and convergent thinking. This study offers novel insights into the underlying neurophysiological mechanism when using these concept generation techniques. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Managing multidisciplinary design: the role of environmental consultancy	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article						environmental design; environmental consultancy; design process management; professional training		Complexity and multi-disciplinary represent the challenge that the design and construction of sustainable buildings have to face. The nature and quantity of information needed are further considerations which lead to re-thinking the whole design process. The architect alone cannot have all the skills required, so he/she should be able to rely on other specialized professionals. In some European countries, environmental consultancy-which deals with ecology matters-is becoming more and more crucial for the design of a successful building. Taking into account two British consultancy companies-investigated as case studies-this paper looks at the way the design process related to complex projects is managed, and at the effects on the architectural sector.

J	Goh, YM; Brown, H; Spickett, J				Goh, Yang Miang; Brown, Helen; Spickett, Jeffery			Applying systems thinking concepts in the analysis of major incidents and safety culture	SAFETY SCIENCE			English	Article						Systems thinking; Safety culture; Root cause analysis; Investigation; Accidents		In recent years, investigations into major incidents often highlight poor safety culture as one of the key causal factors. These investigations are often assisted by causal analysis tools that help to ensure that the investigation and the information captured are systematic. However, current causal analysis tools are not designed to analyse dynamic complexity of major incidents and safety culture, which arises from the interactions between actors and the temporal and spatial gaps between actions and consequences. This is because most causal analysis tools model events and causal factors linearly. In contrast, systems thinking, a discipline of seeing systems holistically, emphasises the circular nature of complex systems, i.e. cause and effect are not distinguishable. This paper proposes that traditional causal analysis tools and investigation should be enhanced with the use of systems thinking tools. One of the systems thinking tools that is particularly useful in analysing major incidents and safety culture is causal loop diagrams. The diagrams can be used to explain the systemic structure sustaining a safety culture and identify effective interventions to improve the safety culture and prevent a recurrence of a major incident. The paper demonstrates the use of systems thinking and causal loop diagrams through a case study on Bellevue hazardous waste fire in Western Australia. The case study shows how different actors in the system, each acting in reaction to pressures that they are facing, produced and sustained a poor safety culture that was a major contributory factor to the fire in 2001.

We employed a curriculum on the history of communication technology to teach students about basic concepts in communication technology and to cultivate their ability to use critical thinking to confront issues in this domain. Concept mapping was adopted to assess students' ability to apply conceptual knowledge to their actual cognitive activities, and a critical thinking test was developed to evaluate students' performance in this regard. The sample consisted of 98 tenth-grade students. We used descriptive statistics, measures of relationships, and qualitative analyses to examine the data. The results indicated that, during the teaching of conceptual knowledge, most students easily fall victim to misconceptions about concepts that they cannot specifically observe in their own experiences and thus find it difficult to construct complete and correct knowledge. Although students' critical thinking about technological issues was positively correlated with their application of conceptual knowledge, their incomplete system knowledge could affect their ability to identify core problems of technological issues, and incorrect theoretical knowledge could influence their abilities to interpret information, thereby affecting their judgments.

It is created as teachers engage in collaborative talk during the design of ICT lessons. Design frames characterize teachers' design reasoning and can substantially influence teachers' TPACK considerations. Yet, this aspect of teachers' TPACK is not well understood. This study examined the design talk conducted by 27 Singapore primary teachers as they worked in teams to integrate student-centered ICT lessons into their school curriculum. Through content analysis and chi-square analyses of about 35 h of coded design talk, it was found that teachers used seven design frames and predominantly considered pedagogical content knowledge, TPACK, and design knowledge when they engaged in ICT lesson design. Teachers' consideration of pedagogical content knowledge was driven by design frames related to idea development, perception, enactment, institutional considerations, and interpersonal factors. On the other hand, teachers emphasized idea development and enactment when they considered TPACK. Teachers also had to consider the management of design processes during ICT lesson design. The implications for teacher ICT professional development are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, there is no general assessment tool for those STEAM creations, so as to help parents or instructors to experience and evaluate the STEAM products created or sold by companies or proposed by academic institutes when they want to introduce one to their children or students. Therefore, this study developed and validated an assessment of STEAM Creation with formative constructs by utilizing the PLS-SEM technique. The four constructs taken into account based on the theoretical foundations were computational thinking (CT) levels, design thinking (DT) levels, STEAM interdisciplinary levels, and literacy-oriented (LO) levels. CT was operationalized as four indicators (i.e., problem decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm steps), and DT was operationalized as another four indicators (i.e., analysis of design requirements, creative brainstorming, hands-on experience, and test and verification). Meanwhile, STEAM was operationalized with five indispensable indicators, where each indicator refers to one discipline. LO was operationalized with three indicators (i.e., cooperation and co-creation, problem solving, and daily application). There were 16 indicators in total. Therefore, the formative relationship was established and evaluated in this study. This paper assessed STEAM creations with a formative measurement model comprising four hypotheses indicating that CT has a significant direct effect on STEAM and LO, DT has a significant direct effect on STEAM while STEAM has a significant direct effect on LO. The results reveal that all four hypotheses were accepted and the paths in the model were confirmed. CT has a significant indirect effect on LO through STEAM, which was also deeply discussed.

J	Stokes, PA				Stokes, Paul A.			From management science to sociology - Cybernetics, finalization and the possibility of a social science	KYBERNETES			English	Review						cybernetics; sociology; sciences; systems analysis; metaphors	KNOWLEDGE	Purpose - This paper seeks to argue that sociology is in need of reconstruction on a theoretical and conceptual foundation of cybernetics, specifically, managerial cybernetics and to show how this hitherto unsuccessful task might be brought about. Design/methodology/approach - The approach is one of a rigorous and deep querying of the reasons for the lack of successful fit heretofore between sociology and cybernetics. By taking a critical, historical and philosophical approach to the development of sciences it opens possibilities for the reconstruction of sociology as a "new science" based on the foundation of cybernetics, specifically the managerial cybernetics of Stafford Beer. Findings - The work argues that the appropriate conceptual foundation for the social sciences is the realm of communication and control, ideas that were given a rigorous formulation in cybernetics, information theory and systems thinking since the 1940s. Many people have seen the prima facie appropriateness of these ideas for the study of human society and numerous attempts have been made to apply them. Almost, all of these efforts have been failures, at least from a sociological point of view. The paper suggests that the problem with all such previous attempts is that they consisted of too direct an application of cybernetics to sociology, entailing a metaphoric reduction that threatened the intellectual integrity of the discipline. Work in the history of sciences suggests that, whereas deep theoretical, foundational work may well be achieved for a realm in the abstract, so to speak it is when attempts are made to apply these results to more phenomenal domains, to which in principle they are deemed appropriate and relevant, that problems of an apparent "lack of fit" arise. It has been found that a group of intermediating concepts is necessary to draw the two domains together in a workable fit. This process has been called "finalization of science". Practical implications - Of immediate value is the reconstruction of sociology as a cybernetically informed science of society that actually delivers theoretical, analytical, research and practical results. Originality/value - The paper represents a highly original synthesis drawn from the history and philosophy of science development to yield immediate and useful results.

As a tool for ensuring the quality of projects and improving learning outcomes, the PDCA cycle strategy is conducive to cultivating reflective thinking. However, there is still a lack of empirical research on the effect of introducing the PDCA cycle strategy into programming education. In this study, using a PDCA cycle strategy, in a four-pronged model of "(P)draw up a plan, (D)assemble and programming, (C)test and debug, display and reflect (A)," and its effects on students' programming skills and their reflective thinking were explored. There were 65 children between the ages of 7 and 8 years participated in this study. There were 31 students in each of the experimental group and the control group. A combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods was adopted in this research, and students' programming processes and results were observed and counted. The study results revealed that after attending the 'Magic Card Robot' course that applied the PDCA cycle strategy, the experimental group students outperformed their counterparts in programming skills (sequencing, repetitive and conditional structures). Meanwhile, the experimental group students' reflective thinking levels were higher than those of the control group students. These findings imply that tangible programming education using the PDCA cycle strategy in the course has potential.

A glossary of user-centered design strategies for implementation experts	TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Implementation; User-centered design; Human-centered design; Design thinking; Evidence-based practice	SERVICE; HEALTH; SUSTAINABILITY; COLLABORATION; DISSEMINATION; ADAPTATIONS; DELIVERY; SCIENCE	User-centered design (UCD), a discipline that seeks to ground the design of an innovation in information about the people who will ultimately use that innovation, has great potential to improve the translation of evidence-based practices from behavioral medicine research for implementation in health care settings. UCD is a diverse, innovative field that remains highly variable in terms of language and approaches. Ultimately, we produced a glossary of UCD-related strategies specifically for experts in implementation research and practice, with the goal of promoting interdisciplinary collaboration in implementation efforts. We conducted a focused literature review to identify key concepts and specific strategies of UCD to translate into the implementation field. We also categorized the strategies as primarily targeting one or more levels of the implementation process (i.e., interventions, individuals, inner context, and outer context). Ultimately, we produced a glossary of 30 UCD strategies for implementation experts. Each glossary term is accompanied by a short, yet comprehensive, definition. The strategies and their definitions are illustrated, using a hypothetical behavioral medicine intervention as an example, for each of the four levels of the implementation process. This UCD glossary may prove useful to implementation experts who wish to develop effective collaborations and "shared language" with UCD experts to enhance use of behavioral medicine research in health services. Directions for future research are also discussed.

A systematic review	LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH			English	Review							AUTHENTICATION; QUALITY	Wearable devices have made it easier to generate and share data collected on individuals. This systematic review seeks to investigate whether deidentifying data from wearable devices is sufficient to protect the privacy of individuals in datasets. We searched Web of Science, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, PubMed, Scopus, and the ACM Digital Library on Dec 6, 2021 (PROSPERO registration number CRD42022312922). We also performed manual searches in journals of interest until April 12, 2022. Although our search strategy had no language restrictions, all retrieved studies were in English. We included studies showing reidentification, identification, or authentication with data from wearable devices. Our search retrieved 17 625 studies, and 72 studies met our inclusion criteria. We designed a custom assessment tool for study quality and risk of bias assessments. 64 studies were classified as high quality and eight as moderate quality, and we did not detect any bias in any of the included studies. Correct identification rates were typically 86-100%, indicating a high risk of reidentification. Additionally, as little as 1-300 s of recording were required to enable reidentification from sensors that are generally not thought to generate identifiable information, such as electrocardiograms. These findings call for concerted efforts to rethink methods for data sharing to promote advances in research innovation while preventing the loss of individual privacy.

Concurrent Think-Aloud Verbalizations and Usability Problems	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-HUMAN INTERACTION			English	Article						Concurrent think-aloud; usability testing; verbalization; verbalization categories; speech features; silence; verbal fillers; sentiment; speech rate; loudness; pitch; usability problems	PROTOCOLS	The concurrent think-aloud protocol-in which participants verbalize their thoughts when performing tasks- is a widely employed approach in usability testing. Despite its value, analyzing think-aloud sessions can be onerous because it often entails assessing all of a user's verbalizations. This has motivated previous research on developing categories to segment verbalizations into manageable units of analysis. However, the way in which a category might relate to usability problems is currently unclear. In this research, we sought to address this gap in our understanding. We also studied how speech features might relate to usability problems. Through two studies, this research demonstrates that certain patterns of verbalizations are more telling of usability problems than others and that these patterns are robust to different types of test products (i.e., physical devices and digital systems), access to different types of information (i.e., video and audio modality), and the presence or absence of a visualization of verbalizations. The implication is that the verbalization and speech patterns can potentially reduce the time and effort required for analysis by enabling evaluators to focus more on the important aspects of a user's verbalizations. The patterns could also potentially be used to inform the design of systems to automatically detect when in the recorded think-aloud sessions users experience problems.

However, dominant DR thinking takes a technological view of the IT artifact, paying scant attention to its shaping by the organizational context. Consequently, existing DR methods focus on building the artifact and relegate evaluation to a subsequent and separate phase. They value technological rigor at the cost of organizational relevance, and fail to recognize that the artifact emerges from interaction with the organizational context even when its initial design is guided by the researchers' intent. We propose action design research (ADR) as a new DR method to address this problem. ADR reflects the premise that IT artifacts are ensembles shaped by the organizational context during development and use. The method conceptualizes the research process as containing the inseparable and inherently interwoven activities of building the IT artifact, intervening in the organization, and evaluating it concurrently. The essay describes the stages of A DR and associated principles that encapsulate its underlying beliefs and values. We illustrate ADR through a case of competence management at Volvo IT.

J	Brown, JM; Bickel, WK; Epstein, LH; Stein, JS				Brown, Jeremiah S.; Bickel, Warren; Epstein, Leonard; Stein, Jeffrey			Episodic future thinking in type 2 diabetes: Further development and validation of the Health Information Thinking control for clinical trials	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ENERGY-INTAKE; RISK	Episodic Future Thinking (EFT) reduces delay discounting and may have the potential as a clinical tool to increase the likelihood of health-promoting behaviors. However, evaluations of EFT in clinical settings require control conditions that match the effort and frequency of cue generation, as well as participants' expectations of improvement. The Health Information Thinking (HIT) control addresses these issues, but how this control affects delay discounting in individuals with diabetes and obesity when utilizing diabetes-management specific health-information vignettes is unknown. Moreover, little research has explored whether EFT reduces delay discounting in individuals with type 2 diabetes. To this end, we examined the impact of EFT, HIT, and a secondary no-cue control condition (NCC; assessments as usual) on delay discounting in 434 adults with self-reported type 2 diabetes and obesity recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk. After completing an initial screening questionnaire, eligible participants reported demographics, then were randomized to EFT, HIT, or NCC conditions. Following the generation of seven EFT or HIT cues, participants assigned to EFT or HIT conditions completed a delay discounting task while imagining EFT or HIT cues; no-cue participants completed the task without cues. EFT participants demonstrated significantly lower delay discounting levels than HIT or NCC participants; no differences in delay discounting between HIT and NCC participants were observed. These results suggest that engaging in EFT, but not diabetes-specific HIT, results in lower delay discounting in adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity. This provides further evidence for the appropriateness of the HIT control for clinical trials examining the effect of EFT on delay discounting in adults with self-reported type 2 diabetes.

The bidders have a pure common value that is drawn from a distribution that is commonly known. The seller does not know the bidders' beliefs about the value and thinks that beliefs are designed adversarially by Nature to minimize profit. We construct a strong maxmin solution to this joint mechanism design and information design problem, consisting of a mechanism, an information structure, and an equilibrium, such that neither the seller nor Nature can move profit in their respective preferred directions, even if the deviator can select the new equilibrium. The mechanism and information structure solve a family of maxmin mechanism design and minmax information design problems, regardless of how an equilibrium is selected. The maxmin mechanism takes the form of a proportional auction: each bidder submits a one-dimensional bid, the aggregate allocation and aggregate payment depend on the aggregate bid, and individual allocations and payments are proportional to bids. We report a number of additional properties of the maxmin mechanisms, including what happens as the number of bidders grows large and robustness with respect to the prior over the value.

A tension between scientific and societal relevance of the notion of safety was noted, raising doubts about the scientific validity of safety science (Safety Science, 2014). As three of the founding fathers of the Safety Science Group (SSG) at Delft University of Technology (DUT) in 1978, we were challenged by this debate to reflect on our ambitions and mission that were expressed during the inception of safety science at DUT. In addition to what has already been described by Hale and De Kroes (1997) and Hale (2014), we elaborate also on personal experiences and insights, gained over a period of some 40 years of work. These additional experiences were gained in particular by the first two authors in the transport domain from a technological and engineering design methodological perspective. They provide a more encompassing scope on the development of safety science in general as a scientific activity at DUT. Parallel developments in other domains have been described in other papers (Hale, 1985, 2006, 2014; Hale and de Kroes, 1997). F irst, we have to correct a long term omission by translating the founding documents for safety science at DUT into English to make them accessible for non-Dutch experts. Second, we highlight the development of three basic notions that were identified in 1978, at the inception of the SSG, as the cornerstones for safety science as a scientific discipline, no matter what domain it is related to: interdisciplinarity, problem-solving orientation and systems approach. We document in this paper their development and use in the transport domain in the DUT as a whole, i.e. more broadly than the SSG. Third, we discuss more in general the observations, particularly of the first two authors on the value and unique role of safety investigation methodology and systems engineering as powerful feedback loops with learning potential and drivers of change through their potential to address safety in complex, dynamic and open transport systems. Fourth, we elaborate on three additional basic notions that are needed as extra building blocks for a paradigm shift in safety thinking, irrespective of disciplines and domains - a full information supply, engineering design methodology and multiple intervention strategies. Finally, we advocate a mutual recognition of the value and validity of scientific paradigms as developed in the various disciplines, that in conjunction constitute safety science as a distinct, multidisciplinary activity in the academic community.

ACADEMIC PEDIATRICS			English	Article						adolescents; assent; children; decision-making; disclosure; ethics; parents	DECISION-MAKING; ASSENT; CONSENT; GENDER; FAMILY; CONFIDENTIALITY; PARTICIPATION	OBJECTIVE: Despite the importance of child assent, there is little consensus on what information should be disclosed and what information is most important to children for decision-making. This study was designed to compare children's/adolescents' priorities for research information with the information parents believe is most important to their children. METHODS: Child-parent dyads completed separate and independent surveys regarding information (risks, benefits, etc) that they perceived to be most important to the child to make decisions about participating in a hypothetical randomized controlled trial. Parents responded in the context of what information they believed their child (not themselves) would think important. RESULTS: Fifty-five parent-child dyads completed surveys. Although all information was deemed important, children/adolescents put greater emphasis on privacy and less on knowing the purpose of the study and the benefits compared with what their parents believed was important to their child. Adolescents (13-17 years old) placed greater importance on knowing the procedures, direct benefits, and the voluntary nature of participation compared with younger children (8-12 years old). Parents of older girls in particular placed greater emphasis on their daughter's need to know the purpose of the study, the procedures, benefits, and voluntary nature, compared with parents of boys. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that the information priorities of children/adolescents considering participation in a randomized controlled trial differ from that which their parents think is important to them. Pediatric researchers can use this knowledge to ensure that parents do not conflate their own expectations/priorities with those of their child and that children receive the information they need.

J	Wu, TT; Liu, WS				Wu, Ting-Ting; Liu, Wei-Shan			Effectiveness of Remote-Control Cars and Authentic Learning in Strengthening Creative Thinking and Problem-Solving Abilities	EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY			English	Article						Authentic learning; Curriculum design; Remote-control cars; Creative thinking; Problem solving	ENVIRONMENTS; FRAMEWORK; SKILLS; VIEWS	Innovation in the design of curricula is widely discussed. Innovative curricula expose students to a diverse range of learning environments and prompt them to ask questions, stimulating their creativity and allowing them to develop a sense of initiative and to hone their problem-solving skills and ability to apply knowledge to practice. The introduction of new technology to the classroom has improved pedagogy and the information literacy of students. Because of these developments, this study expanded the integrative activity curriculum for second-grade elementary school students to an innovative curriculum involving a comprehensive set of activities related to remote-control cars and their use in the community. The students underwent a process of experiential learning in which they became familiar with the operation of remote-control cars. This study divided the students of two second-grade classes into an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group participated in innovative teaching activities as a part of authentic learning courses and were familiarized with the operations of remote-control cars in traffic in the community. The control group participated in innovative teaching activities as a part of the lesson plan for remote-control cars and were familiarized with the operation of the cars in traffic in the community. The creative thinking and problem-solving skills of the students in both groups significantly improved, and the students in the experimental group outperformed those in the control group. The students in both groups indicated that they were satisfied with the curriculum.

With the health measures of social distance, the COVID-19 pandemic forced a strong shift to remote education. With the challenge of delivering quality education through a computer screen, we validated and applied an online course model using active teaching tools for higher education. We incorporated published active-learning strategies into an online construct, with problem-based inquiry and design of inquiry research projects to serve as our core active learning tool. The gains related to students' science learning experiences and their attitudes toward science were assessed by applying questionnaires before, during, and after the course. The course counted on the participation of 83 students, most of them (60.8%) from postgraduate students. Our results show that engagement provided by active learning methods can improve performance both in hard and soft skills. Students' participation seems to be more relevant when activities require the interaction of information, prediction, and reasoning, such as open-ended questions and design of research projects. Therefore, our data show that, in pandemic, active learning tools benefit students and improve their critical thinking and their motivation and positive positioning in science.

Embedded with multimedia design, AR allows diverse paths of exploration in the story contexts for shared story-reading experiences among parents and children. In this study, parents in the reading community (a library and a school) were provided with AR guided support and a skill-building activity. Observations and in-depth interviews were conducted to collect qualitative data. Inductive analysis was used to summarize the findings. Results of the study were summarized in the following themes: Prior adult-child reading experiences; Novelty with AR reading; Parents' scaffolding for using AR; Interactive reflective thinking from AR reading; Positive responses from learning of shared reading; and Parents' suggestions and concerns. It was observed that the AR reflective reading approach encouraged parents to play an active role in guided reading. Children and parents were positive about their active participation in the AR-mediated exploratory reading context. With the AR guided support and skill-building activity, parents applied the scaffolded-reading skills in the AR reading intervention. The AR-mediated reading approach is promising and open to more dynamic design of interactive features.

Sketching and Summarizing to Reduce Memory for Seductive Details in Science Text	JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						seductive details; sketching; science learning; text comprehension	DRAWING CONSTRUCTION; SCIENTIFIC TEXT; MENTAL MODELS; COMPREHENSION; KNOWLEDGE; INFERENCES; DIAGRAMS; RECALL; CAUSAL; STRATEGY	Seductive details refers to interesting pieces of information within an expository text that are only tangentially related to the target concept (Garner, Gillingham, & White, 1989). When the presence of this information results in reduced comprehension, this is called the seductive details effect. Previous work has found the seductive details effect to be resistant to reduction via various instructional manipulations. One avenue that has not been investigated as a tool for reducing the seductive details effect is having students generate sketches. A growing body of research suggests that sketching activities are beneficial for science learning and, moreover, that sketching can improve learning from science text (Ainsworth, Prain, & Tytler, 2011; Van Meter, 2001). The goal of the present research was to investigate the impact of sketching as compared to generating summaries or thinking silently on recall and comprehension of a text that included seductive details. Across two studies, the seductive details effect was replicated; generating sketches did not eliminate it. In Experiment 2, students compared their sketches and summaries to correct ones and were asked to identify differences between them. Results indicated that participants in the summary group recalled the most core concepts and demonstrated the highest comprehension. These results suggest that sketching may not be effective for eliminating the seductive details and that having students generate summaries with feedback may be more successful. These findings inform the design of scaffolding to support learning from naturalistic science text with its distracting details.

Investigating an Asynchronous Model for Incorporating Social Aspects of Engineering Work into Engineering Design Courses	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						instructional change; engineering design; socio-technical thinking	RESISTANCE; STUDENTS; USERS; TALK	This paper describes an implementation study of the Social Engagement Toolkit (SET), a library of trainings on various topics related to socially engaged design and engineering. The customizable SET trainings include asynchronous hybrid learning blocks intended to facilitate instruction on socially engaged engineering topics by non-expert instructors in a range of engineering courses, as well as live expert instruction and entirely virtual instruction, developed for online courses in the 2020-2021 academic year. The SET seeks to foster much-needed socially engaged engineering skills among undergraduate engineering students, while addressing potential barriers to curricular change, such as instructor motivation and prior training. We examined the incorporation of the SET into multiple sections of a senior-level capstone course and a project-based introduction to engineering course to understand the experiences of early adopter faculty and their students. This paper describes faculty's motivations for and their experiences with implementing the SET in their classes, strengths and challenges of the toolkit, and the perceived influence on and relevance to students' course work and future academic and professional plans.

Herein, a design approach is used to generate alternative and multifunctional pastoral livestock production systems that enhance grassland health. As a way of understanding the complexity of grasslands and initiating the design process using systems thinking, rich pictures emerge as a useful method. As rich pictures are subjective views, geographic information systems (GIS) could be applied to improve the veracity of their outcomes, as both techniques are forms of an analytical process. This paper reports the application of GIS to a case study of a high-country farm to generate and combine different thematic maps to create a modern rich picture. The rich picture is a combination of remote sensing data (altitude, slope, aspects, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)), and on-the-ground data (plant species distribution and diversity and soil chemical, biological, and physical parameters). Layers were combined using a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) based on the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to create a final rich picture. The results highlight dissimilarities in perceptions of what underpins 'grassland health' between researchers in different fields and with different perspectives. The use of GIS produced a modern rich picture that enhanced the understanding of grassland health and allowed for the identification of gaps, values, and possibilities for future research work.</p>	[Pereira, Fabiellen C.; Maxwell, Thomas M.

J	Aaron, DK				Aaron, DK			Writing across the curriculum: Putting thoery into practice in animal science courses	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						writing; undergraduate teaching; animal science		Founded on the premise that ''learning to write'' and ''writing to learn'' are parallel processes, Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) programs advocate the use of writing activities to enhance learning in subject matter courses across the university curriculum. Application of WAC theory to creating assignments and evaluating writing in undergraduate animal science courses is the primary focus of this paper. Although a variety of writing-to-learn activities are promoted by WAC programs, this discussion is confined to reader-based, applied or real-world assignments completed by students outside the classroom. Writing assignments of this type are effective learning tools because they guide students toward appropriate information, language, and organization, present writing as communication, not artifact, and allow students to see how classroom study of concepts can be applied to the real world. Additionally, they provide opportunity for feedback during the writing process. Although considerable effort is required to create such writing assignments and to design evaluation and grading strategies that will provide constructive feedback, animal science teachers have a responsibility to provide students with expanded opportunities for improving critical thinking and communication skills. Sharing writing assignments, hire the ones included in this paper, is one way to accomplish these objectives while minimizing aggregate faculty effort.

J	Hsu, TC; Liang, YS				Hsu, Ting-Chia; Liang, Yi-Sian			Simultaneously Improving Computational Thinking and Foreign Language Learning: Interdisciplinary Media With Plugged and Unplugged Approaches	JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING RESEARCH			English	Article						computational thinking; interdisciplinary learning; educational robots; board games; foreign language learning anxiety; cooperation tendency; critical thinking		This study proposed plugged and unplugged approaches for young students to simultaneously improve their interdisciplinary learning performance in English and Computational Thinking (CT). The plugged approach involved adopting educational robots to enhance CT and to provide English vocabulary and sentence practice via a board game. The unplugged version of the educational board game involved using a conventional board game without a computer, although it was designed for practicing CT as well as some foreign language vocabulary and conversational sentences. The results show that both approaches were helpful for simultaneously improving the students' English proficiency of the target vocabulary and sentences, and their CT competence. The students' foreign language learning anxiety during the English conversation in the plugged game was significantly lower than that of the students playing the unplugged game. On one hand, the cooperation tendency of the CT scale improved significantly for the students playing the unplugged game. On the other hand, the critical thinking of the CT scale improved significantly for those using the plugged approach. This research provides an innovation development and evaluation for plugged and unplugged approaches.

In the design process, creative design is one of the important factors to survive the fierce competition. During creative design process, designers are the most critical component. However, design fixation often negatively influences the design outcomes. Many researches from cognitive science and design science reveal that the presentation of outer information can alleviate design fixation effectively. Among different kinds of outer information, language terms are proved to be effective. This work presents a method of automatically generating language terms as design inspirations based on 500,000 granted patents. This method adopts evolutionary computation as the fundamental algorithm to retrieve language terms from a vocabulary base. To implement the algorithm, the vocabulary is first encoded by high dimensional vectors through word embedding, which is a three layers neural network. Further, two metrics for measuring the inspiration potential of language terms are defined in a computable manner. This work also conducts experiments to validate the method, and the experimental results show that (1) the algorithm is efficient and has the potential to be extended to larger vocabulary; (2) the generated design inspirations have a positive influence on the design outcomes.

We incorporate the construct of wishful thinking, an important form of emotion-focused coping behavior that is rarely studied, along with problem-focused coping into a research model to examine the interaction between the two coping approaches. The results reveal that wishful thinking weakens the effect of perceived avoidability on avoidance motivation. In turn, wishful thinking is positively affected by perceived threat and this effect is stronger when a user has low risk tolerance. Although perceived avoidability can reduce wishful thinking, its effect is fully mediated by perceived threat. This study highlights the important role of wishful thinking in affecting users security behavior. It not only corroborates, but also extends the extant propositions of TTAT, thus making a significant contribution to IT security research and practice.

Herein we describe the development of several types of affinity ligands which enable the purification of antibodies under much milder conditions. Results: Staphylococcal protein A variants were engineered by using both structure-based design and combinatorial screening methods. The frequency of amino acid residue substitutions was statistically analyzed using the sequences isolated from a histidine-scanning library screening. The positions where the frequency of occurrence of a histidine residue was more than 70% were thought to be effective histidine-mutation sites. Consequently, we identified PAB variants with a D36H mutation whose binding of IgG was highly sensitive to pH change. Conclusion: The affinity column elution chromatograms demonstrated that antibodies could be eluted at a higher pH (Delta pH**>= 2.0) than ever reported (Delta pH = 1.4) when the Staphylococcal protein A variants developed in this study were used as affinity ligands. The interactions between Staphylococcal protein A and IgG-Fab were shown to be important for the behavior of IgG bound on a SpA affinity column, and alterations in the affinity of the ligands for IgG-Fab clearly affected the conditions for eluting the bound IgG. Thus, a histidine-scanning library combined with a structure-based design was shown to be effective in engineering novel pH-sensitive proteins.

As higher education institutions, we need to take responsibility for this development in every degree course we offer, and provide students with the kind of subjects and activities that best contribute to this aim. In this paper, we study the impact of following an introductory programming course on the development of the computational thinking capabilities of university students. In order to achieve this aim, a concurrent cohort observational study was carried out in which we measured both the subjective and objective computational thinking capabilities of 104 participants (50 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor & x2019;s degree course in Psychology at the Catholic University of Murcia (UCAM), and 54 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor & x2019;s degree course in Health Information Systems at the University of Alicante (UA)). The statistical procedures applied to test our hypotheses were a two-way mixed ANOVA, a paired-sample T-test and an independent-sample T-test. The data shows that the group at UA had an initial higher subjective perception of their computational capabilities than the group at UCAM. This perception was supported by their objective scores, which were also significantly higher. However, the subjective assessment of computational capability of the UA group diminished after exposure to the programming course, contrasting with the fact that their objective computational capabilities improved significantly. In the UCAM group, both subjective and objective capabilities remained constant over time. Based on these results, we can conclude that computational thinking capabilities are not developed naturally, but need to be trained. Providing such training to all our students, and not only to those enrolled on undergraduate degrees in engineering, is of paramount importance to allow them to face the challenges of their future professions. This paper empirically demonstrates the extent to which exposing subjects to a programming course may contribute to this aim.

However, if they are not well developed, poorly implemented EMRs have unintended consequences that may cause harm to patients. One approach to preventing such harm is the involvement of users in the participatory design to ensure user acceptance and patient safety. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the acceptance of a novel patient chart module (PCM) as part of an EMR from the perspective of potential users in PPC and to involve these professionals in the design process. Methods: A qualitative observational study with N = 16 PPC professionals (n = 10 nurses, n = 6 physicians) was conducted, including concurrent think aloud (CTA) and semi-structured interviews. A structured content analysis based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology was applied. Results: The results can be summarized in terms of general observations, performance expectancy, effort expectancy and facilitating conditions, all of which are likely to have a positive influence on acceptance of the PCM from the user perspective in the context of PPC. Conclusions: The involvement of users in the development of EMRs is important for meeting the requirements in PPC. Further software adaptations are necessary to implement these requirements.

J	Fanchamps, NLJA; Slangen, L; Specht, M; Hennissen, P				Fanchamps, Nardie L. J. A.; Slangen, Lou; Specht, Marcus; Hennissen, Paul			The Impact of SRA-Programming on Computational Thinking in a Visual Oriented Programming Environment	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						SRA-programming; Computational Thinking; Visual Programming; On-screen Output	PERFORMANCE; LANGUAGES	Visual programming environments are popular instruments in teaching Computational Thinking (CT) in schools today. Applying Sense-Reason-Act (SRA) programming can influence the development of computational thinking when forcing pupils to anticipate the unforeseen in their computer programs. SRA-programming originates from the programming of tangible robots, but can also be of equal value in visual programming with on-screen output. The underlying rationale is that programming in a visual programming environment using SRA leads to more understanding of the computational concepts addressed, resulting in a higher level of computational skill compared to visual programming without the application of SRA. Furthermore, it has been hypothesised that if pupils in a visual programming environment can anticipate unforeseen events and solve programming tasks by applying SRA, they will be better able to solve complex computational thinking tasks. To establish if characteristic differences in the development of computational thinking can be measured when SRA-programming is applied in a visual programming environment with an on-screen output, we assessed the applicability of SRA-programming with visual output as the main component of the execution of developed code. This research uses a pre-test post-test design that reveals significant differences in the development of computational thinking in two treatment conditions. To assess CT, the Computational Thinking Test (CTt) was used.

This study systematically reviewed how CT has been assessed in the literature. We reviewed 96 journal articles to analyze specific CT assessments from four perspectives: educational context, assessment construct, assessment type, and reliability and validity evidence. Our review results indicate that (a) more CT assessments are needed for high school, college students, and teacher professional development programs, (b) most CT assessments focus on students' programming or computing skills, (c) traditional tests and performance assessments are often used to assess CT skills, and surveys are used to measure students' CT dispositions, and (d) more reliability and validity evidence needs to be collected and reported in future studies. This review identifies current research gaps and future directions to conceptualize and assess CT skills, and the findings are expected to be beneficial for researchers, curriculum designers, and instructors.

However, the pace of thought is an essential property of thinking, and its consequences have recently begun to be discovered. In this chapter, we review the psychological consequences of accelerated and decelerated thought pace. We begin by examining how the manipulation of thought speed alters mood, self-perception, risk-taking, creativity, and arousal. We highlight the energizing, activating, and hedonic effects of fast thinking, and we show how thought-speed effects are independent of thought content, fluency, and goal progress. We describe an adaptive theory of thought speed wherein psychological responses to the acceleration of thinking confer adaptive advantages for confronting novel, urgent, and rapidly changing situations, and engaging in behaviors driven by appetitive motivation. Lastly, we discuss implications of thought speed and its manipulation for treatment of mental illness, for design and delivery of communications and messages, and for life in the age of rapid access and exposure to information.

J	Brown, AL				Brown, AL			Increasing the utility of urban environmental quality information	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						planning; design; policy; science-policy interface; urban environmental quality		There is a need to move towards a view of urban environmental quality and allied concepts that can draw together, in a practical way, the strands of related work from different fields. Perhaps not so obvious is that an important factor in the usefulness of any such work is consideration of who might use the output and how they might use it. Based on experience in the environmental field, this paper suggests that one of the major challenges is to bridge the divide between the environmental quality/well-being/quality-of-life specialists and the players who make urban policy and who shape our physical and social environments-in other words the engineers, planners, architects, service delivery specialists, etc. It might be argued that the issue is how to ensure integrated models and concepts improve environmental quality information available to these key players, but the more immediate issue is how to ensure, if it gets to them at all, can any of it be used? Several propositions are put forward by which environmental quality specialists can hope to maximise the utility of urban environmental quality information and its offspring indicators. Firstly, the environmental quality specialists must understand how urban policy, urban development, and decision-making processes, function. Secondly, they require an understanding of the language, the tools and the thought processes that are used by the development players. Thirdly, they must adopt approaches in which the environmental quality information assists the development players to propose and test scenarios, particularly novel paths of action, that could shift urban development in preferred directions.

However, these systems overlook the important factor of playing style. In this paper, we analyze how playing style affects enjoyment in team competition games, using a mix of Sternberg's thinking style theory and individual histories in the form of statistics from previous matches to categorize League of Legend (LoL) players. Data for approximately 64 000 matches involving 185 000 players were taken from the LoLBase website. Match enjoyment was considered low when games lasted for 26 min or less (the earliest possible surrender time). Results from statistical analyses indicate that players with certain playing styles were more likely to enhance both game enjoyment and team strength. We also used a neural network model to test the usefulness of playing style information in predicting match quality. It is our hope that these results will support the establishment of more efficient matchmaking systems.

The aim of the present study was to assess the psychosocial characteristics, SU problems, and criminal thinking young adults entering SU treatment have, and whether the SU characteristics, sex and age are associated with criminal thinking scores. Methods: The sample was 407 young adults aged 16-29 years who underwent an entry assessment between January 2011 and December 2016 at a residential SU treatment institution in Norway. All study data were extracted from electronic health records, including survey information from the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment and the Psychological Inventory of Criminal Thinking Styles. Results: In the present sample, severe SU, high rates of psychosocial problems, and criminal thinking were reported. Almost three-quarters (72.67%) of young adults reported high levels of criminal thinking (>= 60). However, male participants were more likely to report high levels of criminal thinking compared to female participants (p=0.031). In bivariate regression models, only sex and having stimulants/opioids as primary drug were associated with mean levels of criminal thinking. The same was true in the multiple regression model. Conclusion: Young adults in residential SU treatment are a multi-problem high-risk/high-need group of people. Due to the elevated levels of criminal thinking, we recommend that young adults in SU treatment should be screened for criminogenic treatment needs, such as criminal thinking, regardless of justice involvement.

In face of such a changeable era, the rapid development and circulation of information technology has hastened the diversification of society. To cope with the approach of information society, teaching methods should also be changed, as traditional injection education could no longer adapt to the changing society. Different from the face-to-face lecturing in traditional classrooms, learners at different places could still precede "face-to-face" like instruction through synchronous web-based instruction. It is expected to promote students' creativity. Taking teachers and students of public and private universities in Kaohsiung City as the sampling subjects, 600 copies of questionnaires are distributed. Total 428 valid copies are collected, with the retrieval rate 71%. The research results are concluded as following. 1. Synchronous web-based instruction would affect thinking styles. 2. Synchronous web-based instruction would influence creativity. 3. Thinking styles reveal notably positive effects on creativity. The research results and suggestions are expected to have teachers change the teaching methods in order to promote students' creativity.

J	McCormick, KI; Hall, JA				McCormick, Kate I.; Hall, Jacob A.			Computational thinking learning experiences, outcomes, and research in preschool settings: a scoping review of literature	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Review						Computational thinking; Scoping review; Preschool; Early childhood educational technology	ROBOTICS; EDUCATION; SCIENCE; MEDIA	When implemented appropriately, computational thinking (CT) experiences in early childhood settings build essential literacy skills and foster initial explorations of sequencing, engineering design principles, and cause-and-effect relationships. While existing research explores CT in K-12 settings, there is insufficient research documenting the true scope of CT skills for preschool-age children (ages 3-5 years old). Thus, the paucity of research in this emerging area warranted a scoping review approach. This scoping review surveys existing CT studies with preschool-age participants and maps what is known of CT learning experience design, intended educational outcomes, and CT study design. Evidence from the reviewed articles (n = 17) indicate most studies used physical kits, task-oriented activities, and varying experience timeframes and adult scaffolding. Most studies focused on learning sequencing and events with few embedding remixing and reusing skills. Additionally, studies primarily implemented pre-post research design approaches, and few utilized qualitative methods. The analysis of the reviewed articles indicates gaps exist in CT experience designs, scope of CT interventions, and CT tool research and development. We conclude with recommendations for closing the knowledge gaps by providing specific future research directions.

Research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (CT). The literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply SRA-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. In order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of SRA-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (static/dynamic). In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. It is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes SRA-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment. The influence of SRA-programming as demonstrated identifies characteristics of CT.

Science, engineering, technology and mathematics (STEM) courses rely extensively on visuals in lectures, readings and homework to improve knowledge. However, undergraduate students do not automatically acquire visual literacy and a lack of intervention from instructors could be limiting academic success. In this study, a visual literacy intervention was developed and tested in the face-to-face (FTF) and online sections of an undergraduate non-major Introduction to Environmental Science course. The intervention was designed to test and improve visual literacy at three levels: (1) elementary-identifying values; (2) intermediate-identifying trends; and (3) advanced-using the data to make projections or conclusions. Students demonstrated a significant difference in their ability to answer elementary and advanced visual literacy questions in both course sections in the pre-test and post-test. Students in the face-to-face course had significantly higher exam scores and higher median assessment scores compared to sections without a visual literacy intervention. The online section did not show significant improvements in visual literacy or academic success due to a lack of reinforcement of visual literacy following the initial intervention. The visual literacy intervention shows promising results in improving student academic success and should be considered for implementation in other general education STEM courses.

Diagnosis of management of bacterial wilt and late blight in potato in Ethiopia: A systems thinking perspective	NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						Bacterial wilt; Late blight; Potato; Systems thinking; Complex problems; Disease management	RALSTONIA-SOLANACEARUM; INFORMATION; VARIETIES; NETWORKS; SCIENCE; FARMERS; CHENCHA	Potato is one of the most important food crops for smallholder farmers in the Ethiopian highlands. Diseases, particularly bacterial wilt (caused by Ralstonia solanacearum) and late blight (caused by Phytophthora infestans), are among the major constraints of potato production, despite continuous efforts to control them. Bacterial wilt and late blight are complex problems with multiple technical and institutional features, involving multiple actors with different perceptions and understanding, not only of the problem but also of possible solutions. Appreciating such complexity, this study adopted a systems thinking perspective. It aimed to explore actors' understanding of the complex problem situation and its implication for the management of the diseases at a collective level. Using a multi-stakeholder workshop and in-depth interviews, a qualitative study was conducted with actors that are directly or indirectly involved in the management of the two diseases. Results showed that actors essentially overlooked key systemic problems in the management of the two diseases. This is mainly reflected in actors' tendency to give event-level responses, shift responsibilities and engage in a mutual blaming to the problem of bacterial wilt and late blight. Lack of a preventive disease management culture, limited recognition of interdependencies among activities of actors, power inequalities, and top-down and linear approaches in information and knowledge sharing are identified as key structural problems that are underrated by the actors. We contend that the most appropriate way forward towards the management of both diseases is designing and implementing management strategies that, on the one hand, are preventive of disease epidemics, and, on the other hand, foster horizontal information sharing, learning and collective action among the local actors in the system. Digital platforms, particularly mobile-based technologies, can play a role in catalyzing new forms of information sharing, broader learning, and collaboration among farmers and local actors.

Eye-tracking and lag sequential analysis reveal attention to data and reasoning when reading conflicting information	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Applications in subject areas; Data science applications in education; Information literacy; Teaching; learning strategies; 21st century skills	EPISTEMIC BELIEFS; COMPREHENSION STRATEGIES; SCIENCE INFORMATION; LEARNING-STRATEGIES; TEXT COMPREHENSION; STUDENTS; DOCUMENTS; SEARCH; ARGUMENTATION; METACOGNITION	Critical reading is required for information literacy in the 21st century. However, how students read and process conflicting information regarding controversial issues is still not clear. Using eye-tracking technology, this exploratory study aimed to identify visual behavior patterns that characterized critical reading strategies when students processed conflicting information about socio-scientific issues, and to examine relationships among students' visual behavior, reading strategies, and reading task outcomes. Forty-eight undergraduate and graduate students participated and read conflicting texts about food-science issues. The conflicting texts were presented in the traditional Chinese language. Participants' eye movements were tracked during the entire reading process and their self-reported critical reading strategies, recall, and opinions on the issues were collected right after reading. Pearson's correlation analyses, lag sequential analyses, and content analyses were used to analyze the data. Results showed that participants with higher scores on self-reported critical reading strategies tended to pay more attention to reasoning information in conflicting reports and to include more judgments in their responses. Further, two significant visual behavior patterns were identified for critical reading: (1) after a pause for thinking or resting, critical readers' visual attention shifted directly back to reasoning information; and (2) critical readers' visual attention shifted between reasoning and data information. These two visual behavior patterns suggested that data inspection is important for critical reasoning about conflicting information. This study provided evidence for the applicability of eyetracking technology in assessing critical reading strategies and relationships between eye-tracking data and self-reported critical reading strategies. Findings can contribute to the future design of adaptive learning systems and teaching of critical reading strategies.

There has been no consensus on the underlying question of "What is structuring knowledge in SS?" This paper focuses on knowledge structuring accompanied by supporting of thinking. It addresses the key challenges associated with knowledge structuring in SS, identifies the requirements for the structuring of knowledge, proposes a reference model, and develops an ontology-based mapping tool as a solution to one layer of the reference model. First, we identify the important requirements for SS knowledge structuring. Second, we develop a reference model composed of five layers based on three of the requirements. Third, we develop an ontology-based mapping tool at Layer 2 of the reference model for meeting the two major challenges for SS, namely, identifying what problems should be addressed in SS itself and proposing solutions for those problems. The tool is designed to store and retrieve information regarding SS, to provide access to a prototype ontology for SS, and to create multiple maps of conceptual chains depending on a user's interests and perspectives. Finally, we assess whether the developed tool successfully realizes the targeted part of the reference model for SS by examining the tool's conformity to the reference model, as well as its usability, effectiveness, and constraints. Although several issues were identified in the prototype ontology and the mapping tool, the study concluded that the mapping tool is useful enough to facilitate the function of Layer 2. In particular, the mapping tool can support thinking about SS from the viewpoint of: (a) finding new potentials and risks of technological countermeasures studied in SS; (b) helping users to get a more comprehensive picture of problems and their potential solutions; and (c) providing an effective opportunity to come up with new ideas that might not be thought of without such a tool.

J	Thomson, AJ; Schmoldt, DL				Thomson, AJ; Schmoldt, DL			Ethics in computer software design and development	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						ethics; software design and development; traditional ecological knowledge; indigenous knowledge; intellectual property; information ecologies	EXPERT SYSTEM; KNOWLEDGE; DIAGNOSIS; ELICITATION; MANAGEMENT	Over the past 20 years, computer software has become integral and commonplace for operational and management tasks throughout agricultural and natural resource disciplines. During this software infusion, however, little thought has been afforded human impacts, both good and bad. This paper examines current ethical issues of software system design and development in relation to privacy, accuracy, property, accessibility, and effects on quality of life. These issues are explored in the context of simulation models, databases. geographic information systems and artificial intelligence programs, especially expert systems. New approaches to system development place a much higher emphasis on the effects of system deployment within a complex human environment. Software design decisions often depend on more than one ethical issue, possibly conflicting, where the appropriate ethical choice is not always clear cut. Professional codes of ethics do little to change peoples' behavior; rather, incentives for using an ethical approach to software development may lie in significantly increased likelihood of system success.

Accordingly, digital visual collaborative learning (DVCL) technology has great potential to facilitate students' remote collaborative design experiences. This study investigates the fitness of DVCL for DT learning activities and the factors influencing students' continued use of the technology with a model integrating technology acceptance model (TAM) and design task-technology fit (DTTF). The research findings demonstrate that the perceived usefulness of the technology is the primary direct factor influencing the continuance intention toward the technology. In addition, the DTTF mediated by perceived usefulness and ease of use significantly affected the intention to continue using the technology. The visual characteristics of the technology influenced the DTTF in the collaborative design environment. This study highlights visualization as a critical feature of collaborative learning in DT education and provides implications from both theoretical and practical perspectives.

It involves the skillful implementation of a multitude of data analysis and interpretation methods to reach managerial and operational decisions. For this reason, it poses a number of challenges to students in all disciplines, especially in the social sciences. The present study highlights these challenges through the analysis of 4 complementary research works that are based on 3 instruments: a scientific corpus, surveys, and data science job offers posted on LinkedIn-Israel. The study's findings indicate that although data science is perceived to be an important domain that exerts a high influence on our society, social sciences' students still do not have sufficient skills to cope with the challenges it poses. The study suggests equipping students with the skills and qualifications necessary for big data analysis through the design of adequate academic programs. The current article discusses these findings and their implications.

J	Shaw, R				Shaw, Rajib			Thirty Years of Science, Technology, and Academia in Disaster Risk Reduction and Emerging Responsibilities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE			English	Article						Co-design solutions in disaster risk reduction; Professional society; Science and technology in disaster risk reduction; Society 5; 0		The 1990 initiation of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction marked its 30th year in 2019. The three decades since then have seen significant developments in science and technology and their incorporation into the decision making in the field of disaster risk reduction. The disasters that have occurred during that time have enhanced the importance of the field, and new research and innovations have evolved. This article summarizes this evolution through the review of specific milestones. While the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 provides opportunities for synergies with the sustainable development agenda, the science and technology communities have also changed their roles from advisory to co-designing and co-delivering solutions. Higher education plays an important role in developing new generations of professionals, and the role of thematic incubation in higher education institutions is highlighted along with the development of the professional society in disaster risk reduction. The evolution from Society 4.0 (information age) to Society 5.0 will see an enhanced role of the technology-driven approach in disaster risk reduction, while traditional knowledge and indigenous technologies still remain valid for society. Scientists and science communities need to be more sensitive to changing the "last mile" concept to "first mile" thinking with respect to the users' needs and perspectives.

Study Design We developed an algorithm, "netts," to map the semantic content of speech as a network, then applied netts to construct semantic speech networks for a general population sample (N = 436), and a clinical sample comprising patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), people at clinical high risk of psychosis (CHR-P), and healthy controls (total N = 53). Study Results Semantic speech networks from the general population were more connected than size-matched randomized networks, with fewer and larger connected components, reflecting the nonrandom nature of speech. Networks from FEP patients were smaller than from healthy participants, for a picture description task but not a story recall task. For the former task, FEP networks were also more fragmented than those from controls; showing more connected components, which tended to include fewer nodes on average. CHR-P networks showed fragmentation values in-between FEP patients and controls. A clustering analysis suggested that semantic speech networks captured novel signals not already described by existing NLP measures. Network features were also related to negative symptom scores and scores on the Thought and Language Index, although these relationships did not survive correcting for multiple comparisons. Conclusions Overall, these data suggest that semantic networks can enable deeper phenotyping of formal thought disorder in psychosis. Whilst here we focus on network fragmentation, the semantic speech networks created by Netts also contain other, rich information which could be extracted to shed further light on formal thought disorder. We are releasing Netts as an open Python package alongside this manuscript.

The authors propose the appropriate system to eliminate the collaboration culture gaps between the related functional units based on in-process interaction learning in a business process outsourcing company.Design/methodology/approachThis study employed action research (AR) based on soft systems methodology (SSM) with a system thinking approach, in which the authors and process actors design the agreed information-sharing system by involving the process actors in identifying the initial problem situation as well as validating the conceptual model through discussions and designing the expected system.FindingsThis study discovers that SSM-based AR is a suited method for designing a system that supports the formation of collaboration culture among actors in the digital service creation process by learning user perceptions and expectations in order to obtain their commitment to empower the proposed system.Originality/valueIn addition to providing a system to minimize the lack of collaboration culture, this study contributes to the academic literature by offering a new way of planning and designing in a system development methodology using soft systems approaches to understand user perceptions, expressing user interaction in a conceptual model and validating it and defining agreed activities to obtain the best design according to user expectations.

Pre-College Engineering Studies: An Investigation of the Relationship Between Pre-college Engineering Studies and Student Achievement in Science and Mathematics	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						K-12 engineering education; math achievement; science achievement	MIDDLE-SCHOOL SCIENCE; TECHNICAL-EDUCATION; PRIOR KNOWLEDGE; TEACHERS; BELIEFS; DESIGN; CAREER	BACKGROUND The U.S. has experienced a shift from a manufacturing-based economy to one that overwhelmingly provides services and information. This shift demands that technological skills be more fully integrated with one's academic knowledge of science and mathematics so that the next generation of engineers can reason adaptively, think critically, and be prepared to learn how to learn. PURPOSE(HYPOTHESIS) Project Lead the Way (PLTW) provides a pre-college curriculum that focuses on the integration of engineering with science and mathematics. We documented the impact that enrollment in PLTW had on student science and math achievement. We consider the enriched integration hypothesis, which states that students taking PLTW courses will show achievement benefits, after controlling for prior achievement and other student and teacher characteristics. We contrast this with alternative hypotheses that propose little or no impact of the engineering coursework on students' math and science achievement (the insufficient integration hypothesis), or that PLTW enrollment might be negatively associated with student achievement (the adverse integration hypothesis). DESIGN/METHOD Using multilevel statistical modeling with students (N = 140) nested within teachers, we report findings from a quantitative analysis of the relationship between PLTW enrollment and student achievement on state standardized tests of math and science. RESULTS While students gained in math and science achievement overall from eighth to tenth grade, students enrolled in PLTW foundation courses showed significantly smaller math assessment gains than those in a matched group that did not enroll, and no measurable advantages on science assessments, when controlling for prior achievement and teacher experience. The findings do not support the enriched integration hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS Engineering education programs like PLTW face both challenges and opportunities to effectively integrate academic content as they strive to prepare students for college engineering programs and careers.

Modelling the information-seeking behaviour of children and young people Inspiration from beyond LIS	ASLIB PROCEEDINGS			English	Article						Information retrieval; Group behaviour; Children (age groups); Youth; Information science; United Kingdom	NEGOTIATION; UNCERTAINTY; NEEDS	Purpose - The paper seeks to draw on Sice's systems model, itself based on Senge's "fixes that fail" archetype, and on data from two previous research projects conducted by one of the authors. The purpose of this paper is to synthesise a new model that portrays the information-seeking behaviour of children and young people. Design/methodology/approach - The systems model provides the backbone of the new framework but additions, accommodations and revisions were made to ensure that the version featured here represents the phenomenon of information seeking by the young as appropriately as possible in terms of the data that were gathered. Findings - One of the new model's most significant characteristics is its emphasis on problems and issues that prevent information seeking from proceeding smoothly. Information seeking is also shown to be an iterative process, with the individual often revisiting previous stages, frequently in response to difficulties. Research limitations/implications - Data were collected from pupils in just seven schools. The undertaking of research further a-field would be invaluable, if the extent to which the model is applicable to other information-seekers in different environments is to be ascertained. Practical implications - The model demonstrates the importance of the information professional's educative role, in terms of both delivering formal information literacy instruction and providing assistance at the point of need. Originality/value - Although the use of ideas and frameworks from other disciplines, with the aim of increasing understanding of phenomena within LIS, is a growing trend, this paper represents one of the first attempts to apply an existing model associated with systems thinking to information behaviour.

J	Gao, JL; Xu, L; Wan, MX				Gao, Junling; Xu, Lei; Wan, Mingxi			Incremental learning for an evolving stream of medical ultrasound images via counterfactual thinking	COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS			English	Article						Medical ultrasound images; Classification; Incremental classifier; Continual learning; Counterfactual thinking		Despite the fact that traditional deep learning (DL) approaches provide promising accuracy and efficiency in medical ultrasound image analysis, they cannot replace the physician in making a diagnosis since the DL model is only appropriate in static application scenarios. Currently, most DL-based models are incapable of learning new tasks in the dynamic clinical environments due to the catastrophic forgetting of old tasks. To address the above problem, we propose an incremental classifier that is sequentially trained on evolving tasks for medical ultrasound images by counterfactual thinking. Specifically, the proposed model consists of a feature extractor and a classifier that can add new classes at any time during training. Toward a more discriminative model in the continual learning setting, a contrastive strategy is designed to leverage fine-grained information by generating a series of counterfactual regions. For model optimization, we design a multi-task loss made up of a knowledge distillation loss, a cross-entropy loss, and a contrasting loss. This objective jointly enjoys the merits of less forgetting, better accuracy, and fine-grained information utilization. A newly collected dataset with 52 medical ultrasound classification tasks is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The proposed approach achieves 76.59%, 11.67%, and 7.93% in terms of the average incremental accuracy, forgetting rate, and feature retention, respectively.

Why facts don't change minds: Insights from cognitive science for the improved communication of conservation research	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Research -implementation spaces; Evidence -based conservation; Research impact; Cognitive science; Behavioral science	DECISION-MAKING; BEHAVIOR; EMOTION; DIFFUSION; KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION; LITERACY; STORIES; LURE	Conservation scientists increasingly seek to find ways to implement their research for improved policy and practice. However, such efforts may be ineffective, or even counterproductive, if they are based on outdated models of science communication and behavioral change. Insights from fields that study how information is processed in the brain, how and why humans make decisions and take action, and how change spreads across social networks can support and improve existing efforts to translate conservation research into practice and policy. However, little of this research has made its way into the conservation science literature, thus limiting the power of these ideas to influence how research is communicated and how impact is understood. This paper seeks to address this gap by discussing four common myths about how to best communicate science for decision -making, namely, that facts change minds, scientific literacy will lead to enhanced research uptake, individual attitude change will shift collective behaviors, and broad dissemination is best. The article provides four alter-native insights that can support effective science communication and impact: engaging the social mind for optimal decision-making, understanding the power of values, emotions, and experience in swaying minds, changing collective behavior, and thinking strategically for biggest impact. If we can understand how people process information, we can design interventions based on the best possible evidence of how humans make decisions for conservation management and policy.

The computational physics course (CPC) is one subject that is designed to support students in the practice of CT. Many studies show that the worksheets could be a solution in a CPC as a scaffold to achieve the CT objectives both online and offline. The study aims to develop the worksheet and integrate it with CT in a computational physics course. This study applied the research and development (R & D) method with the ADDIE model approach. In the results, the evaluation test from the experts reached a very good interpretation score based on the learning media expert (96%), the teaching material expert (95%), and the pedagogy experts (92%). So that this media is declared feasible to be used in the CPC. Furthermore, after the experimental study of students who took the computational physics course (n = 31), the study showed that the modified course could significantly improve student skills regarding overall CT (p value <0.05). However, this research also found that cooperative learning as part of CT had no improvement (p value >0.05). The experiment was conducted amid the COVID 19 pandemic wherein the students could only study at home for the whole semester. These findings indicate that the pandemic has impacted the collaborative skills of students on the course.

The participants consist of 73 students in tertiary institutions in South-East Nigeria that offer Computer and Robotics Education programme. There was no sampling as the entire second-year trainee teachers of computer and robotics education in the selected institutions participated in the study. The instrument used for data collection was the Robotics Programming Computational Thinking Scale (RPCTS). Mean and standard deviation were used to answer the research questions, while Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used to test the hypotheses at an alpha level of 0.05. The result of the study showed that students who were taught using Project-based Arduino Robot Application (PARA) had higher mean computational thinking scores than those taught using the conventional lecture method, and there was a significant difference in the mean computational thinking scores of students based on method of instruction. Also, the male students taught robotics programming using PARA had higher mean computational thinking scores compared to their female counterparts, and there was a significant difference in the mean computational thinking scores of male and female students taught robotics programming using PARA. Schools and other stakeholders in education should support the training of teachers on how to develop and used project-based approaches in teaching/learning robotics programming-related courses.

Offering web-based concept mapping education can increase motivation for learning in students actively using the Internet. Objectives: To examine the effects of web-based concept mapping education on nursing students' concept mapping and critical thinking skills. Design: This is a double-blind, randomized, controlled, experimental study. Settings: A nursing faculty at a state university in Turkey. Participants: Second-year nursing students taking the course surgical nursing in the spring term of the academic year of 2018/2019. Methods: The experimental group (n = 201) was offered web-based concept mapping education before starting practicums. Data were collected using a students' information form, concept map evaluation keys, and the Critical Thinking Motivational Scale at the end of the practicums. A structured questionnaire was used to reveal opinions of the students about concept mapping. Results: There was a significant difference in concept mapping scores between the students offered web-based concept mapping education (16.45 +/- 10.91) and those not receiving this education (12.70 +/- 9.31) (p=.000). Also, there was a significant difference in students' scores for the subscales of Critical Thinking Motivational Scale expectancy, attainment and utility between the groups. The students reported that concept maps facilitated their learning and management of nursing processes but that they occasionally experienced difficulty. Conclusion: It can be concluded that web-based concept mapping education improves concept mapping skills and motivation for critical thinking skills. Web-based education could be utilized as a tool to enhance nursing students' concept mapping and critical thinking skills.

J	Ahmady, S; Shahbazi, S				Ahmady, Soleiman; Shahbazi, Sara			Impact of social problem-solving training on critical thinking and decision making of nursing students	BMC NURSING			English	Article						Social problem solving; Decision making; Critical thinking; Nursing; Student	IMPLEMENTATION; ABILITY; NURSES	Background The complex health system and challenging patient care environment require experienced nurses, especially those with high cognitive skills such as problem-solving, decision- making and critical thinking. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of social problem-solving training on nursing students' critical thinking and decision-making. Methods This study was quasi-experimental research and pre-test and post-test design and performed on 40 undergraduate/four-year students of nursing in Borujen Nursing School/Iran that was randomly divided into 2 groups; experimental (n = 20) and control (n = 20). Then, a social problem-solving course was held for the experimental group. A demographic questionnaire, social problem-solving inventory-revised, California critical thinking test, and decision-making questionnaire was used to collect the information. The reliability and validity of all of them were confirmed. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software and independent sampled T-test, paired T-test, square chi, and Pearson correlation coefficient. Results The finding indicated that the social problem-solving course positively affected the student' social problem-solving and decision-making and critical thinking skills after the instructional course in the experimental group (P < 0.05), but this result was not observed in the control group (P > 0.05). Conclusions The results showed that structured social problem-solving training could improve cognitive problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making skills. Considering this result, nursing education should be presented using new strategies and creative and different ways from traditional education methods. Cognitive skills training should be integrated in the nursing curriculum. Therefore, training cognitive skills such as problem- solving to nursing students is recommended.

However, in reality, biology instruction only focuses on academic achievement in the Indonesian biology curriculum. Previous research has found that scientific inquiry is a practical approach to improve academic achievement and scientific literacy. Interactive socio-scientific inquiry (ISSI) was developed based on a distinctive inquiry approach. The ISSI uses socio-scientific issues as a learning context and uses digital technology as an interaction platform. This research used a quasi-experimental design with a pre-test-post-test non-randomised control group involving 196 tenth-grade students. The findings revealed substantial differences in learning outcomes between ISSI students with conventional and classroom discussion teaching methods. The ISSI students have significant enhancements in scientific literacy, biological knowledge, and critical thinking. These findings suggest the utility of using socio-scientific issues (to be criticised and resolved) and digital technology (with its interactive involvement as a learning interaction platform) to complement inquiry in biology teaching. The ISSI is an alternative method to support biology teaching in becoming more creative and encourages secondary school students to be more critical in learning content.

J	Bazin, N; Perruchet, P; Hardy-Bayle, MC; Feline, A				Bazin, N; Perruchet, P; Hardy-Bayle, MC; Feline, A			Context-dependent information processing in patients with schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						context processing; implicit memory; interactive context; schizophrenic patients; thought-disorder schizophrenic patients	EXPLICIT MEMORY; IMPLICIT; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; ASSOCIATIONS	Thirty schizophrenic patients fulfilling the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria for schizophrenia and 30 control participants were shown a set of incomplete sentences, and were asked to complete them with the first word(s) that came to mind. Target sentences included an ambiguous word, the ambiguity of which was not resolved within the clause. However, completion necessarily required participants to select one specific meaning. Each target sentence was preceded by another sentence playing the role of context, which was designed to prime the less frequent meaning of the ambiguous word. The results showed that schizophrenic patients, especially those with thought disorder [on the basis of their TLC scores (Thought, Language and Communication Scale; Andreasen, N.C., 1979. Thought, language and communication disorders. Clinical assessment, definition of terms and evaluation of their reliability. Diagnostic significance. Arch. Cen. Psychiatry 39, 778-782)], used the most common meaning of the ambiguous word more frequently than controls, thus revealing a specific deficit in context use. The deficit was observed whether or not the relation between context and target sentences was made explicit. These results are in line with the cognitive models of schizophrenia that postulate a decreased ability to use context information. However, when considered in the light of prior studies (e.g., Bazin, N., Perruchet, P., 1996. Implicit and explicit memory in patients with schizophrenia. Schizophr. Res. 22, 241-248), they suggest that the deficit in processing contextual information is limited to what Baddeley (Baddeley, A.D., 1982. Domains of recollection. Psychol. Rev. 98, 708-729) called the interactive context (which affects the meaning, or the interpretation, of the target event) in contrast to the independent context (which does not interfere with the meaning-based interpretation of the target event).

However, the over-emphasis on cognition fails to clearly identify the triggers of change necessary for service innovation. In response, this article draws on classic American pragmatism and service-dominant logic to highlight the underappreciated role of actors' bodily experiences when using design methods for service innovation. The authors of this paper posit that design methods stage aesthetic disruption, a sensory experience that challenges actors' existing assumptions. In doing so, the use of design methods can lead to destabilizing the habitual action of participating actors, helping them to break free of existing institutions and contribute to service innovation.

Following design science framework conventions and running design workshops that integrate design thinking of "how might we" design questions, literature analysis, and expert interviews across disciplines, this study presents findings regarding three main activities-consulting, reporting, and communicating. Based on the iterations of design workshops that adopt a circular economy-based partner map design canvas for stakeholder analysis with procedures such as expert interviews and literature analysis, three partner/capability maps were generated to map stakeholders and explore the capabilities needed. ESG and carbon information digital and data skills emerged as the core capability to complete all the three tasks. A conceptual framework-a Smart System of ESG and Carbon Information-is proposed to summarize planning, operating, and communicating with ESG and carbon information, along with high-level organizational actions and talent capabilities. It identifies the building blocks of an ESG operating system within an enterprise to engage various stakeholders for value-creation collaboration. Despite the limitation of a lack of comprehensive review and limited geographic and disciplinary representation, this study provides a roadmap for enterprises and universities to explore and define talent requirements and create specific education and training programs.

J	Bai, GH				Bai, GH			Embryonic approach to the development of information systems	JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Embryonic Approach; information systems; communication mechanisms	PD; PROJECTS	Prototyping in information systems CIS) development has recently shown increased benefits. In principle, the prototyping process provides users with more opportunities to improve their work, to verify that their needs are provided for, and that the terms used in the interface of the designed system are consistent with those in use in their work. As a result, they should be highly motivated to participate in an IS development process. However, certain drawbacks inherited from traditional prototyping in industrial production could limit the use of this approach in IS development. Some problems are identified in this paper, such as: (1) product-oriented thinking; (2) feedback delay; (3) the preoccupation of designers with respect to the experimental approach; (4) problems arising from the users' participation being indirect, and (5) negative attitudes towards contradiction. This paper proposes an organic approach, the 'Embryonic Approach' (EmA), in order to explore the full potentialities of prototyping in IS development. This approach is based on two fundamental elements; an adaptive and expandable kernel-structure, and a built-in communication mechanism. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

To implement the IoT concept, the research in the areas of power controlled circuits, embedded systems design, network protocols and control theory should be required. With the much advancement in these areas, the realization of IoT is becoming increasingly probable. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive power control scheme for IoT systems. Based on the cognitive hierarchy thinking mechanism, our proposed scheme is designed as a new behavioral game model to adaptively control the power level. To effectively solve the power control problem in IoT systems, game theory is well-suited and an effective tool. The experimental result illustrates that our game-based approach can get an effective transmission power, which can make the communication rate maximal. Under dynamic IoT system environments, it is highly desirable property. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Shim, H; Lee, H				Shim, Hyoyoung; Lee, Hyangeun			The effect of design education using virtual reality-based coding on student competence and educational satisfaction	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Virtual reality (VR); Coding education; Design education; Design methodology; Problem-solving skills; Computational thinking		Virtual reality (VR) technology is playing a crucial role in the changing paradigm of education. In many cases, however, VR technology is not being taught because of the lack of relevant educational content at middle and high school levels. This study investigates the effect of design education using VR-based coding on students' competence and educational satisfaction in Korea. To develop a design education program using VR-based coding, examples of VR application and coding education were analyzed. Based on this analysis, we developed 2 design education programs for middle and high school students with the Korean school curriculum in mind. The program was taught to a sample of 301 students for six weeks. Following the implementation of the program, we conducted a satisfaction survey, and the correlation between the competence of middle and high school students and their educational satisfaction was statistically analyzed. The results showed that scientific competence exerts the greatest effect on students' overall educational satisfaction, followed by common competence, core competence, and information competence. Operational satisfaction was most affected by information competence, followed by core competence, common competence, and scientific competence. Core competence and information competence had a similar effect on levels of satisfaction with the educational environment. The developed program showed the potential to cultivate student competence and demonstrated that virtual reality-based coding is meaningful to design education. By understanding the competences that can exert a positive effect on satisfaction, this study is expected to provide effective baseline data for planning future curricula.

J	Flamm, RO; Braunsberger, K				Flamm, Richard Owen; Braunsberger, Karin			Systems thinking to operationalize knowledge-to-action in fish and wildlife agencies	CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE			English	Article						complex organizations; conservation organizations; knowledge network; knowledge-to-action; systems thinking	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS; COMPLEXITY THEORY; BOUNDARY OBJECTS; PATH DEPENDENCE; POLICY-MAKERS; MANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION; COPRODUCTION; LEADERSHIP	This paper incorporates systems thinking in the design of a knowledge networked systems model (KNSM) for supporting knowledge-to-action in conservation organizations. It assumes that organizations are complex entities with properties that should be considered normatively. The synthesis of these properties into a KNSM revolves around the most common question many conservation practitioners are asked by the public: how is X doing? X typically reflects a concept easily grasped by the public such as a species or ecosystem. To operationalize a KNSM, one should consider that (1) information, not authority, empowers the network, (2) structural or bureaucratic impediments to maximizing utility of knowledge are minimized, (3) interacting agents direct the flow of information and knowledge and guide agency outputs, (4) boundaries between offices, programs, departments, and organizations are treated as porous, (5) transparency is fundamental to successful model operation, (6), most conservation problems are spatial, and (7) ecological and knowledge hierarchies organize the network. Benefits of this approach include facilitating research outcomes that support management decisions, a tool for strategic planning and implementation, greater transparency and operational clarity, foundation for team building, means for identifying knowledge gaps, a platform for organizational in-reach and public outreach, facilitated communication in general, and an important tool for collaborative conservation decision making. An example using a hypothetical listed species is presented to illustrate how a KNSM can be designed and implemented.

Sample: Participants were 37 higher education students. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to either the deep or surface condition in a between-subjects design. The conditions contained the same videos but had differing task demands to induce different cognitive levels of processing. Trace-data as well as cued-retrospective think aloud data of all participants was gathered. Participants filled out a multi-layered post-test measure. Data was analysed with the Bayesian framework. Results: Results suggest that students in the deep condition spent more time on key information and processed both details and key information in a deeper way. Students in the surface condition spent more time on details and factual knowledge while also rehearsing them more. Students in the deep condition scored higher on the amount and coherence of information they recalled from the videos. Conclusions: The use of multiple data sources and multi-layered post-test measures is a crucial step in better understanding and adequately measuring differences in cognitive processes when learning from interactive videos.

To improve the effectiveness of HIV prevention and treatment service implementation, we need to understand what drives human behaviour and decision-making around HIV service use. This review highlights current thinking in the social sciences, emphasizing how understanding human behaviour can be leveraged to improve HIV service delivery.Recent findingsThe social sciences offer rich methodologies and theoretical frameworks for investigating how factors synergize to influence human behaviour and decision-making. Social-ecological models, such as the Behavioural Drivers Model (BDM), help us conceptualize and investigate the complexity of people's lives. Multistate and group-based trajectory modelling are useful tools for investigating the longitudinal nature of peoples HIV journeys. Successful HIV responses need to leverage social science approaches to design effective, efficient, and high-quality programmes.To improve our HIV response, implementation scientists, interventionists, and public health officials must respond to the context in which people make decisions about their health. Translating biomedical efficacy into real-world effectiveness is not simply finding a way around contextual barriers but rather engaging with the social context in which communities use HIV services.

A semantic representation model for design rationale of products	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Design rationale; Design semantics; Representation model; Ontology	INFORMATION; SYSTEMS; CAPTURE	Design rationale (DR) is crucial information in product design decision support, design analysis and design reuse. In this paper, based on the Issue-based Information System (IBIS) model, a new ontology-based semantic representation model for DR information; the integrated issue, solution, artifact and argument (ISAA) model; is proposed. The ISAA model introduces the ontology-based semantic representation mode to the DR representation and expands the concept elements of IBIS. The class of concept elements and the semantic relationships among them are defined by Web Ontology Language (OWL). The axioms and rules which are used to reason and analyze DR are defined and encoded with Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL), which enrich the semantic relations defined by OWL The ISAA model represents the directed graph of IBIS to the Resource Description Framework (RDF) graph and serializes to an RDF/XML document which lays the foundation for retrieving and reasoning semantic information of DR. A semantic annotator integrating with the visual product design model was developed, by which the discrete information of thinking is captured and abstracted to a conceptual representation of the ISAA model. Finally, an example of DR representation for the spring operating mechanism of a high-voltage circuit breaker product is given. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Mete, F				Mete, F			The creative role of sources of inspiration in clothing design	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLOTHING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						fashion design; clothing; creative thinking; design calculations; design management		Purpose - To assess the creative role of sources of inspiration in visual clothing design. It aims to analyse simple, general accounts of observed design behaviour and early stages of the clothing design process, what is the nature of design inspiration, how sources of inspiration are gathered and how they affect the creativity and originality in clothing design. Design/methodology/approach - A progressive series of empirical studies looking at ready-to-wear clothing design has been undertaken; in situ observation, semi-structured inter-views and constrained and semi-constrained design tasks. This empirical approach used ethnographic observational methods, which is effective in situations where conventional knowledge acquisition methods are insufficient, when broad understanding of an industry is needed, as in the fashion industry, not just a case study of a single individual or company. Findings - Identifies the major types of idea sources in clothing design and provides information about each source. Recognises that these sources of inspiration help designers to create design elements and principles of individual designs. In order to foster originality, sources of inspiration play a powerful role throughout the creative stage of design process, and also in the early stages of fashion research and strategic collection planning. Originality/value - This paper highlights the role of sources of inspiration and its effect in creativity and originality in the clothing design process. Offers practical help to clothing designers and design-led clothing companies.

VIKOR method was introduced to compute the ranking value of each scheme. A multiobjective optimization model for criteria weight was established. In this model, projection pursuit method was employed to identify a criteria weight set which could keep classification information of original schemes to the greatest extent, while PROMETHEE II was adopted to keep sorting information. Dominance based multiobjective simulated annealing algorithm (D-MOSA) was introduced to solve the optimization model. Finally, an example was taken to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of this model.

Analytic thinking and political belief updating	COGNITION			English	Article						Political beliefs; Bayesian updating; Cognitive sophistication; Polarization	COGNITIVE REFLECTION TEST; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MOTIVATED SKEPTICISM; SCIENCE LITERACY; PARTISAN BIAS; INFORMATION; PSYCHOLOGY; POLITICIZATION; PERFORMANCE; INFERENCE	A surprising finding from U.S. opinion surveys is that political disagreements tend to be greatest among the most cognitively sophisticated opposing partisans. Recent experiments suggest a hypothesis that could explain this pattern: cognitive sophistication magnifies politically biased processing of new information. However, the designs of these experiments tend to contain several limitations that complicate their support for this hypothesis. In particular, they tend to (i) focus on people's worldviews and political identities, at the expense of their other, more specific prior beliefs, (ii) lack direct comparison with a politically unbiased benchmark, and (iii) focus on people's judgments of new information, rather than on their posterior beliefs following exposure to the information. We report two studies designed to address these limitations. In our design, U.S. subjects received noisy but informative signals about the truth or falsity of partisan political questions, and we measured their prior and posterior beliefs, and cognitive sophistication, operationalized as analytic thinking inferred via performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test. We compared subjects' posterior beliefs to an unbiased Bayesian benchmark. We found little evidence that analytic thinking magnified politically biased deviations from the benchmark. In contrast, we found consistent evidence that greater analytic thinking was associated with posterior beliefs closer to the benchmark. Together, these results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that cognitive sophistication magnifies politically biased processing. We discuss differences between our design and prior work that can inform future tests of this hypothesis.

In this study, we present object recognition process, based on context + focus information visualization techniques, as a foundation for realization of Panorama. We show that user can easily define data vocabulary of selected domain that is furthermore used as the application framework. The purpose of Panorama approach is to facilitate software development of certain problem domains by shortening the Software Development Life Cycle with minimizing the impact of implementation, review and maintenance phase. Our approach is focused on using and updating data vocabulary by users without extensive programming skills. Panorama therefore facilitates traversing through data by following associations where user does not need to be familiar with the query language, the data structure and does not need to know the problem domain fully. Our approach has been verified by detailed comparison to existing approaches and in an experiment by implementing selected use cases. The results confirmed that Panorama fits problem domains with emphasis on data oriented rather than ones with process oriented aspects. In such cases the development of selected problem domains is shortened up to 25%, where emphasis is mainly on analysis, logical design and testing, while omitting physical design and programming, which is performed automatically by Panorama tool.

Using focus groups to design systems science models that promote oral health equity	BMC ORAL HEALTH			English	Article						Oral public health; Dental public health; Oral health equity; Systems science; Agent-based modeling; Qualitative analysis; Focus group analysis; Racial/ethnic minorities; Older adults; Community-based oral health care	CHRONIC DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY; OLDER-ADULTS; DISPARITIES; LIFE; GEOGRAPHY; DYNAMICS; THINKING; ACCESS; POLICY	Background: While the US population overall has experienced improvements in oral health over the past 60 years, oral diseases remain among the most common chronic conditions across the life course. Further, lack of access to oral health care contributes to profound and enduring oral health inequities worldwide. Vulnerable and underserved populations who commonly lack access to oral health care include racial/ethnic minority older adults living in urban environments. The aim of this study was to use a systematic approach to explicate cause and effect relationships in creating a causal map, a type of concept map in which the links between nodes represent causality or influence. Methods: To improve our mental models of the real world and devise strategies to promote oral health equity, methods including system dynamics, agent-based modeling, geographic information science, and social network simulation have been leveraged by the research team. The practice of systems science modeling is situated amidst an ongoing modeling process of observing the real world, formulating mental models of how it works, setting decision rules to guide behavior, and from these heuristics, making decisions that in turn affect the state of the real world. Qualitative data were obtained from focus groups conducted with community-dwelling older adults who self-identify as African American, Dominican, or Puerto Rican to elicit their lived experiences in accessing oral health care in their northern Manhattan neighborhoods. Results: The findings of this study support the multi-dimensional and multi-level perspective of access to oral health care and affirm a theorized discrepancy in fit between available dental providers and patients. The lack of information about oral health at the community level may be compromising the use and quality of oral health care among racial/ethnic minority older adults. Conclusions: Well-informed community members may fill critical roles in oral health promotion, as they are viewed as highly credible sources of information and recommendations for dental providers.

J	Varasteh, M; Hoydis, J; Clerckx, B				Varasteh, Morteza; Hoydis, Jakob; Clerckx, Bruno			Learning to Communicate and Energize: Modulation, Coding, and Multiple Access Designs for Wireless Information-Power Transmission	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN); noisy channel; power transfer; nonlinear energy harvester; machine learning; modulation; SNR; symbol error rate (SER); Machine Learning (ML) decoding; Simultaneous Wireless Information-Power Transmission (SWIPT)	WAVE-FORM DESIGN; NONLINEARITY; SIGNAL	The explosion of the number of low-power devices in the next decades calls for a re-thinking of wireless network design, namely, unifying wireless transmission of information and power so as to make the best use of the RF spectrum, radiation, and infrastructure for the dual purpose of communicating and energizing. This article provides a novel learning-based approach towards such wireless network design. To that end, a parametric model of a practical energy harvester, accounting for various sources of nonlinearities, is proposed using a nonlinear regression algorithm applied over collected real data. Relying on the proposed model, the learning problem of modulation design for Simultaneous Wireless Information-Power Transmission (SWIPT) over a point-to-point link is studied. Joint optimization of the transmitter and the receiver is implemented using Neural Network (NN)-based autoencoders. The results reveal that by increasing the receiver power demand, the baseband transmit modulation constellation converges to an On-Off keying signalling. Utilizing the observations obtained via learning, an algorithmic SWIPT modulation design is proposed. It is observed via numerical results that the performance loss of the proposed modulations are negligible compared to the ones obtained from learning. Extension of the studied problem to learning modulation design for multi-user SWIPT scenarios and coded modulation design for point-to-point SWIPT are considered. The major conclusion of this work is to utilize learning-based results to design non learning-based algorithms, which perform as well. In particular, inspired by the results obtained via learning, an algorithmic approach for coded modulation design is proposed, which performs very close to its learning counterparts, and is significantly superior due to its high real-time adaptability to new system design parameters.

However, previous studies did not distinguish between the different learning modes of the four-stage experiential learning cycle (i.e., concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation). With our study, we contribute a deeper understanding of how the unique opportunities of virtual reality can afford each of the four experiential learning modes. We conducted three design thinking workshops with interdisciplinary teams of students and lecturers. These workshops resulted in three low-fidelity virtual reality prototypes which were evaluated and refined in three student focus groups. Based on these results, we identify design elements for virtual reality applications that afford an holistic experiential learning process in higher education. We discuss the implications of our results for the selection, design, and use of educational virtual reality applications.

LGBTQ+ Youth HeLP (Health Literacy Project) is a holistic online sexual health resource providing evidence-based information to LGBTQ+ youth in an accessible and age-appropriate format. This article considers potential opportunities and obstacles for utilizing DT to develop responsive solutions to health inequities and health-related KT learned from the project. Codesign offers effective options for generating collaborations that may increase cross-stakeholder perspective taking in group settings and produce high-quality outputs with increased likelihood of uptake.

However, students may be limited by traditional computational thinking development activities because they may have a lower degree of computational thinking efficacy for persistent learning of AI when encountering difficulties (computational thinking efficacy in learning AI). Accordingly, this study aimed to explore the relationships among Chinese secondary school students' computational thinking efficacy in learning AI, their AI literacy, and approaches to learning AI. Structural equation modeling was adopted to examine the mediation effect. Data were gathered from 509 Chinese secondary school students, and the confirmatory factor analyses showed that the measures had high reliability and validity. The results revealed that AI literacy was positively related to students' computational thinking efficacy in learning AI, which was mediated by more sophisticated approaches to learning AI, contributing to the current understanding of learning AI. It is crucial to focus on students' AI literacy and deep approaches (e.g., engaging in authentic AI contexts with systematic learning activities for in-depth understanding of AI knowledge) rather than surface approaches (e.g., memorizing AI knowledge) to develop their high-level computational thinking efficacy in learning AI. Implications for designing the AI curriculum are discussed.

J	Lewandowska, A; Matuszak-Flejszman, A				Lewandowska, Anna; Matuszak-Flejszman, Alina			Eco-design as a normative element of Environmental Management Systems-the context of the revised ISO 14001:2015	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT			English	Editorial Material						Eco-design; Environmental management systems; Life cycle thinking	ECODESIGN; ENTERPRISES; BARRIERS	The aim of this article is to signal the changes envisaged by ISO TC/207 SC1 for introduction in the new version of ISO 14001:2015 as well as to discuss the role of eco-design and life cycle thinking (LCT) in the context of Environmental Management Systems (EMS). A review of the proposed changes to be introduced in the new version of ISO 14000:2015 with particular emphasis on those related to LCT and eco-design has been carried out. Additionally, for the purpose of this article, the guidelines with regard to ISO 14006:2011 have been analysed in the context of the role that eco-design plays in an EMS. The new version of ISO 14001:2015 includes many direct and indirect references to LCT. One of the key changes is organisations adapting a wider perspective to see how their environmental impact stretch across the whole supply chain. Another key recommendation is to use eco-design for identifying and assessing the environmental aspects in relation to products. The whole life cycle of the products should be analysed, which will result in the inclusion of indirect environmental aspects that are beyond the direct control of the organisation. The planned changes to ISO 14001:2015 with regard to the use of LCT and eco-design should be seen as a significant piece of information by eco-designers and life cycle assessment (LCA) practitioners since they provide a real opportunity to increase interest in eco-design tools amongst the environmental managers responsible for the environmental management systems within their organisations. It seems that now is the right time to initiate information campaigns and training on eco-design and LCA tailored specifically for organisations, which have implemented environmental management systems.

However, manual analysis of these audio comments is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This paper aims to propose an approach for automated comprehensive evaluation of user interface (UI) satisfaction. It takes advantage of text mining and sentiment analysis (SA) techniques instead of manual analysis in order to assess user comments collected by the CTA. Based on the results of the SA, the proposed approach makes use of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method to evaluate the overall satisfaction and support developers for UI design improvements. In order to enhance the objectivity of evaluation, a sentiment matrix originating from text mining and SA on user comments is used to replace the criteria and the relative weights of the AHP method which were previously defined by experts. A comparison between the questionnaire survey method and the proposed approach in the empirical study suggested that the latter can efficiently evaluate UI satisfaction with high accuracy and provide designers abundant and specific information directly related to defects in design. It is argued that the proposed approach could be used as an automated framework for handling any type of comments.

Furthermore, visitors decoded throughout and not only upon initial use of the visualization. The study analyzed think-aloud data to identify issues visitors had mapping the visual representations to their intended referents, examine why they occurred, and consider if and how these decoding issues were resolved.

Objectives: This study examined the effect of an integrated pediatric nursing simulation used in a nursing practicum on students' CT abilities and identified the effects of differing numbers of simulation exposures on CT in a multi-site environment. Design: The study used a multi-site, pre-test, post-test design. Participants and settings: A total of 237 nursing students at three universities enrolled in a pediatric practicum participated in this study from February to December 2013. Methods: All three schools used the same simulation courseware, including the same simulation scenarios, evaluation tools, and simulation equipment. The courseware incorporated high-fidelity simulators and standardized patients. Students at school A completed one simulation session, whereas students at schools B and C completed two and three simulation sessions, respectively. Yoon's Critical Thinking Disposition tool (2008) was used to measure students' CT abilities. Results: The gains in students' CT scores varied according to their numbers of exposures to the simulation courseware. With a single exposure, there were no statistically significant gains in CT, whereas three exposures to the courseware produced significant gains in CT. In seven subcategories of critical thinking, three exposures to the simulation courseware produced CT gains in the prudence and intellectual eagerness subcategories, and the overall simulation experience produced CT gains in the prudence, systematicity, healthy skepticism, and intellectual eagemess subcategories. Conclusions: Simulation courseware may produce positive learning outcomes for prudence in nursing education. In addition, the findings from the multi-site comparative study may contribute to greater understanding of how patient simulation experiences impact students' CT abilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Cook, J; Ellerton, P; Kinkead, D				Cook, John; Ellerton, Peter; Kinkead, David			Deconstructing climate misinformation to identify reasoning errors	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						climate change; critical thinking; misinformation; inoculation	REFUTATION; SCIENCE; TEXT	Misinformation can have significant societal consequences. For example, misinformation about climate change has confused the public and stalled support for mitigation policies. When people lack the expertise and skill to evaluate the science behind a claim, they typically rely on heuristics such as substituting judgment about something complex (i.e. climate science) with judgment about something simple (i.e. the character of people who speak about climate science) and are therefore vulnerable to misleading information. Inoculation theory offers one approach to effectively neutralize the influence of misinformation. Typically, inoculations convey resistance by providing people with information that counters misinformation. In contrast, we propose inoculating against misinformation by explaining the fallacious reasoning within misleading denialist claims. We offer a strategy based on critical thinking methods to analyse and detect poor reasoning within denialist claims. This strategy includes detailing argument structure, determining the truth of the premises, and checking for validity, hidden premises, or ambiguous language. Focusing on argument structure also facilitates the identification of reasoning fallacies by locating them in the reasoning process. Because this reason-based form of inoculation is based on general critical thinking methods, it offers the distinct advantage of being accessible to those who lack expertise in climate science. We applied this approach to 42 common denialist claims and find that they all demonstrate fallacious reasoning and fail to refute the scientific consensus regarding anthropogenic global warming. This comprehensive deconstruction and refutation of the most common denialist claims about climate change is designed to act as a resource for communicators and educators who teach climate science and/or critical thinking.

Traditional rigorous methods take significant amounts of time and manpower to evaluate the usability of a system. In this paper, we evaluate the use of instant data analysis (IDA) as developed by Kjeldskov et al. to perform usability testing on a tool designed for older adults and caregivers. The IDA method is attractive because it takes significantly less time and manpower than the traditional usability testing methods. In this paper we demonstrate how IDA was used to evaluate usability of a multifunctional wellness tool, discuss study results and lessons learned while using this method. We also present findings from an extension of the method which allows the grouping of similar usability problems in an efficient manner. We found that the IDA method is a quick, relatively easy approach to identifying and ranking usability issues among health information technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper reports on an initiative designed to introduce underrepresented populations to computing using an eclectic, multifaceted approach. As part of a yearlong computing course, students engage in Maker activities, participatory simulations, and computing projects that foreground the social and collaborative aspects of CS. Collectively, these activities are designed to introduce learners to the growing diversity of what CS looks like in the 21st century. This paper lays out the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS. A snapshot of one activity from the program is provided-Wearing the Web-in which students use open-hardware programmable badges to explore the underlying structure and technology that enables the Internet. Data from the first year of the CT4G program are presented to show the positive effects that this diverse introduction to CS is having on the students with respect to their attitudes toward CS.

Images and text are connected to represent surrogates (enhanced bookmarks), optimizing the use of human cognitive facilities. Composition, an alternative to lists and spatial hypertext, is used to represent a collection of surrogates as a connected whole, using principles from art and design. This facilitates the creative process of information discovery, in which humans develop new ideas while finding and collecting information. To provoke the user to think about the large space of potentially relevant information resources, a generative agent proactively engages in collecting information resources, forming image and text surrogates, and composing them visually. The agent develops the collection and its visual representation over time, enabling the user to see ideas and relationships. To keep the human in control, we develop interactive mechanisms for authoring the composition and directing the agent. In a field study in an interdisciplinary course on The Design Process, over a hundred students alternated using combinFormation and Google+Word to collect prior work on information discovery invention assignments. The students that used combinFormation's mixed-initiative composition of image and text surrogates performed better.

Fortunately, computational cognitive science offers insight into human decision-making using tools that will be familiar to those with backgrounds in optimization and control (e.g., probability theory, statistical machine learning, and reinforcement learning). Here, we review some of this work, focusing on how cognitive science can provide forward models of human decision-making and inverse models of how humans think about others' decision-making. We highlight relevant recent developments, including approaches that synthesize black box and theory-driven modeling, accounts that recast heuristics and biases as forms of bounded optimality, and models that characterize human theory of mind and communication in decision-theoretic terms. In doing so, we aim to provide readers with a glimpse of the range of frameworks, methodologies, and actionable insights that lie at the intersection of cognitive science and control research.

This study contributes to research on the teaching and learning of differential multivariable calculus and its didactics. This is an important area due to its multiple applications in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (STEM). The study tests a previously proposed model of mental constructions students may use to understand partial derivatives through a set of activities designed to help students make the conjectured constructions. The model is based on the local linearity of differentiable two-variable functions, and the model-based activities explore the relationship between partial derivatives and tangent plane in different representations. We used semi-structured interviews with eleven students whose teacher used the three-part cycle-Activities designed with the genetic decomposition; collaborative work in small groups and Class discussion; and Exercises for home (ACE)-as pedagogical strategy. The model-based activity set based on local linearity and the ACE strategy helped students construct a geometric understanding of partial derivatives. Results led to reconsider and further refine the model. This study also resulted in improving activity sets and obtaining information on students' construction of second-order and mixed partial derivatives.

This study aimed to promote an assessment tool using a two-tier Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT). The study used the Design and Development Research (DDR) method with four stages of data collection: expert judgment, usability test, simulation study, and student feedback. The two-tier questions have been tested empirically and fit with the Generalized Partial Credit Model (GPCM) or 2 Parameter Logistic (2PL). This study proved that the CAT could be used to estimate students' CT with a minimum different Standard Error of Measurement (different SEM) or close to zero (⁓0.001). According to the expert judgment, CAT was proper for measurement with a feasibility of 90.23%. The usability test proved that CAT was feasible to use, with satisfaction of 79.51%. Furthermore, the simulation study or empirical measurement explained that students' CT at the high school level were greater than at the middle and lower school levels. Thus, CAT were empirically proven to estimate students' CT accurately. Finally, students' feedback showed that the acceptance from students' feedback is 74.40% with a very satisfactory category.

J	Mettis, K; Väljataga, T				Mettis, Kadri; Valjataga, Terje			Designing learning experiences for outdoor hybrid learning spaces	BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						integrated learning; mobile learning; situated and contextualized learning; higher-order thinking	MOBILE DEVICES; STUDENTS; SCIENCE; KNOWLEDGE; TEACHERS; THINKING	With the support of various personal and institutional mobile technologies, numerous physical and virtual spaces can be turned into interesting and motivating hybrid learning settings. By its nature, outdoor mobile learning happens on the move is connected to specific locations and settings inviting learners to study their surroundings, inquire about natural phenomena and solve complex real-life problems. This poses challenges for teachers to design meaningful, contextualized and comprehensive learning experiences. The paper aims to explore what kind of mobile learning scenarios K-12 teachers create and what are the limitations and development perspectives of these scenarios. Content analysis of 25 location-based outdoor learning tracks with 465 questions and tasks was carried out. The results demonstrate that designing and implementing learning activities outside the safe, familiar classroom environment in new hybrid learning spaces is a challenging task for the teachers on many different levels. Taking Bloom's revised taxonomy, types of contextualization and integrated learning models as frameworks for content analysis of the learning scenarios, the study shows that the teachers do not perceive the potential hybrid spaces and mobile technologies offer in order to design consistent learning experiences that emphasize higher order thinking levels, encompass contextual information and integrate knowledge from multiple disciplinary sources. The paper concludes that there is a need for more teacher training and systemic interventions into current teaching practices that encourage teachers to step outside of their existing teaching paradigms to acknowledge the pedagogical potential of hybrid learning spaces as well as the technological affordances.

Data modeling is an activity that has been proposed to engage students in reasoning about the working mechanism of AI technologies. While Computational thinking (CT) has been conceptualized as critical processes that students engage in during data modeling, much remains unexplored regarding how students created features from unstructured data to develop machine learning models. In this study, we examined high school students' patterns of iterative model development and themes of CT processes in iterative model development. Twenty-eight students from a journalism class engaged in refining machine learning models iteratively for classifying negative and positive reviews of ice cream stores. This study draws on a theoretical framework of CT processes to examine students' model development processes. The results showed that students (1) demonstrated three patterns of iterative model development, including incremental, filter-based, and radical feature creation; (2) engaged in complex reasoning about language use in diverse contexts in trial and error, (3) leveraged multiple data representations when applying mathematical and computational techniques. The results provide implications for designing accessible AI learning experiences for students to understand the role and responsibility of modelers in creating AI technologies and studying AI learning experiences from the angle of CT processes.

This study aims to examine the development of CT in problem-solving skills (PSS) and programming learning attitude by integrating LEGO robotics kits in a project-based learning course. Design/methodology/approach This study examines the development of CT in PSS and programming learning attitude by integrating LEGO robotics kits in a project-based learning course. This study consists of a single group pre-post-test research design with 32 freshmen university students. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected by pre-post-tests and recording of classroom discussions, respectively. Findings Therefore, this finding implies that robotics can be used to develop CT in university students; however, there is a need for designing curricula with advanced robotic kits as artificial intelligence (AI) has become more prevalent. Hence, programming knowledge learned will help students to understand the application of robots in AI. Originality/value The study creates educators' awareness that CT skills might be developed in freshmen university students through robotics. However, many still consider them toys rather than learning aids.

However, the pursuit of architectural design aesthetics introduces glare into buildings, which can be uncomfortable and even dangerous for health. Scholars in related fields have carried out many theoretical studies and design activities based on this problem. In this study, we focus on issues of glare in public buildings, aiming to improve light comfort by solving this problem. First, we propose an improved design strategy based on IDEO design thinking by adding the step of diverging from the design scheme. Second, guided by the results of a questionnaire survey and light environment simulations, we avoided the subjective simplicity of the traditional design process. Third, taking the main library of Shanghai Jiao Tong University as an example, we designed a movable sunshade that could effectively reduce glare effects and improve visual comfort, which improved the light comfort in public buildings. The simulation results show that the proposed design can be useful in buildings to effectively control glare and improve visual comfort and health.

From a theoretical point of view, the paper explores service design with a Systems Thinking lens. A multi-contextual perspective aiming to analyze, decompose, and design smart cities services where resilience is an input at the service design level is described and the four diamondsof-context model for service design (4DocMod) is introduced. This service model accommodates various actors' contexts in public service design and consists of four design artefacts, the diamonds (See, Recognize, Organize, Do). From a practical point of view, guidelines for the application of the 4DocMod service model extension for resilience are described along with two case studies addressing the recent COVID-19 pandemic that illustrates a clear situation of resilience with insights in multiple contexts. According to the findings of this paper, it is obvious that resilience is not ``just'' a request. Instead, it plays a higher role within the service system. It is not ``just'' another Context, either. Instead, it goes through many contexts with different circumstances. In this manner, it is possible to address the qualities through which actors can become resilient, at the service design stage, to ensure continuity of the public services in times of emergency. As our approach using the 4DocMod is proposing, resilience may be is achieved when specific properties are provisioned at information service design level.

We have hit the funding wall. For the past 3 decades scientists have not had to think much about how space technology would change within their planning horizon. However, this time around enormous improvements in space infrastructure capabilities and, especially, costs are likely on the 20-year gestation periods for large space telescopes. Commercial space will lower launch and spacecraft costs substantially, enable cost-effective on-orbit servicing, cheap lunar landers and "interplanetary cubesats" by the early 2020s. A doubling of flagship launch rates is not implausible. On a longer timescale it will enable large structures to be assembled and constructed in space. These developments will change how we plan and design missions. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SYSTEMS			English	Article						Critical Success Factors (CSF); Healthcare Information Systems (HIS); holistic approach; systems thinking; system levels	TECHNOLOGY; QUALITY; FAILURE; DESIGN; IMPLEMENTATION; THINKING; PROJECT	Studies on Critical Success Factors (CSFs) in Healthcare Information Systems (HIS) development projects have traditionally often been limited to retrospectively identifying CSFs in a finished project. In this paper, we focus on how to prospectively apply and manage CSFs in HIS projects. Based on a holistic perspective and systems thinking, an inductive research strategy was applied and a single in-depth case study was conducted. The findings include detailed descriptions that contribute to further understanding of how to prospectively apply and manage CSFs in HIS projects. The analysis reveals that CSFs must be applied differently and managed on various system levels. Furthermore, it shows how interactions exist between different system levels, both in the case of a specific CSF and between different CSFs on various system levels. Our analysis framework and findings indicate new directions for future research: how to prospectively apply and manage CSFs in HIS development projects can now be investigated both in a more holistic way and more in detail. Finally, healthcare practitioners can use the descriptions as practical checklists for guiding them in how to realize situational adaptation of CSFs in HIS projects across different system levels.

J	Zhou, Y; Chen, SH				Zhou, Yi; Chen, Shaohan			Design Innovation of Ethnic Cultural Wisdom Tourism Products Based on Digital Information Technology	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article								With the improvement of people's living standards, ethnic tourism has begun to develop in an all-round way, and correspondingly, ethnic cultural products have become more and more dazzling. However, the current tourists' satisfaction with ethnic cultural tourism products is generally low, so the innovative design of tourism products is an important means to improve the satisfaction of tourism products. The purpose of this paper was to use digital information technology to study the innovation of national cultural wisdom tourism product design and to optimize tourism products. This paper first expounded the experiential design of ethnic cultural tourism products which applies the TEAR theory, and the ASEB grid analysis introduced the four factors of theme, environment, activity, and reaction, analyzed the experience of tourism from the perspective of tourists, then introduced the extraction and development process of digital information technology, and then built a three-dimensional digital model of ethnic cultural tourism product design to lay a solid foundation for product design. In addition, this paper took the development of ethnic cultural tourism products in Yunnan ethnic villages as a case to investigate and analyze the tourist market and tourist needs and finally put forward some product design ideas and suggestions. Through the research and analysis of tourists, it is found that there are more young and middle-aged tourists in Yunnan ethnic villages, and most of them travel with their families. According to the survey of tourists' preferences, more than 80% of tourists like high-quality and low-cost tourism products, and nearly 50% of tourists want to gain a thinking experience in tourist attractions. The most popular forms of tourists were ethnic art and traditional culture. Therefore, designers can design tourism products according to the preferences of tourists and improve the satisfaction of tourism products.

The skills tested included language, mathematical, graphical, three-dimensional visualisation, information processing and reasoning skills. The results showed that their competence in the basic intellectual skills needed to study science effectively was far below standard. This lack of competence could be expected to be detrimental to self-confidence and may also be an important reason for the high failure rate of students in their science courses. We concluded with the suggestion that much greater emphasis should be placed on the systematic and sustained training of students in intellectual skills and strategies of various types and that such training should be integrated, throughout the courses, with the teaching of subject content.

J	Jarusawat, P; Cox, A; Bates, J				Jarusawat, Piyapat; Cox, Andrew; Bates, Jo			Community participation in the management of palm leaf manuscripts as Lanna cultural material in Thailand	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Community participation; Thailand; Indigenous knowledge; Buddhism; Collection management; Palm leaf manuscripts	INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE; LIBRARY	Purpose The cultural heritage of the Lanna region of upper Northern Thailand is unique. One of its distinctive features is palm leaf manuscripts (PLMs), which are viewed simultaneously as examples of sacred writing and religious symbols, means of transferring cultural knowledge, artefacts of beauty and fragile historical documents. Local people still care about these objects, and speak the language but knowledge of the script is limited. The purpose of this paper is to explore the views of community members and experts about the value and management of PLMs as the basis for developing a model of community-based collection management. Design/methodology/approach Because the purpose was to explore differing perceptions and beliefs around PLMs the study adopted an interpretivist worldview. Data were collected through interviews with local people with an interest in PLMs and experts who advised on organising them. In addition, observation and a photo inventory method was used to collect data. Data were analysed thematically. Findings The results showed that while both groups saw the value of the knowledge PLMs contained, the community placed particular importance on the earning of merit through activities related to them as Buddhist objects. Experts gave particular emphasis to the knowledge of herbal medicine contained in the PLMs. The community valued indigenous storage and preservation practices. Experts were particularly pre-occupied with the intellectual property issue around medical knowledge and convenient storage and digitisation. Research limitations/implications Existing theory around libraries, archives and museums suggest some starting points for how community participation might be managed, but the unique circumstances of Lanna PLMs calls for a distinctive approach. Practical implications The paper identifies a pathway suitable to the Lanna context that can build on current local practices, to enhance community participation in the management of PLMs, including a consideration of the role of information professionals. Originality/value This paper is one of the first to extend thinking about participatory practices in the library, archive and museum literature to the context of Thailand and specifically to the case of PLMs, in the Lanna region. Rigorous data analysis of a substantial body of evidence has enhanced the understanding of the different types of value placed on PLMs. It identifies an important but not unbridgeable tension between how local people and experts view PLMs. It builds on previous library, archive and museum theory to propose a realistic model of how communities and experts (including librarians) can work together to protect the rich cultural resource represented by PLMs.	[Jarusawat, Piyapat] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Humanities, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Cox, Andrew; Bates, Jo] Univ Sheffield, Informat Sch, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England	Chiang Mai University; University of Sheffield	Cox, A (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Informat Sch, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.	pjarusawat1@sheffield.ac.uk; a.m.cox@sheffield.ac.uk; jo.bates@sheffield.ac.uk		Bates, Jo/0000-0001-7266-8470					30	7	7	5	31	EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD	BINGLEY	HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND	0022-0418	1758-7379		J DOC	J.

The literature identifies homegrown preferences and heterogeneity in strategic thinking as two major causes of overcommunication. We design an experiment that features team decisions and combines strategic and non-strategic communication to evaluate these competing explanations. We find that (a) the vast majority of strategic truthful behavior in communication of private information coincides with best responses to beliefs about opponents, (b) truthful behavior observed in non-strategic communication has limited ability to predict behavior in strategic communication, and (c) other-regarding preferences play a minimal role in influencing communication behavior in our strategic environments. Our findings favor strategic thinking as the primary explanation of overcommunication and caution that truthful preferences documented in non-strategic settings may not readily explain strategic truthful behavior.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

This paper reports two studies investigating the unique contribution of mental rotation ability to spatial thinking in a STEM discipline. Using authentic disciplinary tasks from chemistry, we show that the difficulty of a spatial disciplinary task varies with the spatial complexity of the stimulus and the axis of rotation regardless of the representation used in the task. We also show that spatial thinking may depend more upon students' developing representational competence in this STEM discipline than spatial ability. These findings suggest that curriculum and assessment designers must more carefully consider how different representations are used in the STEM classroom for both learning and evaluation. We argue that educational interventions that target representational competence may be more effective at supporting spatial thinking in STEM than those that attempt to train generic spatial ability. Educational Impact and Implications Statement Failure and attrition rates in college science courses are disproportionately high. This problem has been attributed, in part, to the observation that science courses routinely require students to reason about complex spatial relationships, such as forces or atoms, that are imperceptible to the naked eye. In these studies, we examined the relative contribution of spatial ability and learned disciplinary skills, such as interpreting scientific diagrams, for predicting achievement on science assessment tasks. We examined how student performance varied on a routine assessment task from chemistry that involves mentally imaging and rotating molecules. The results show that a student's spatial ability is related to performance when the task involves 3-D models, and that the task becomes more difficult if the spatial complexity of the molecule increases or if the molecule is rotated out of the picture plane. The results suggest new instructional strategies for helping students interpret spatial information in scientific diagrams and new design principles for science assessments.

J	Lim, I				Lim, Iris			A physical neuroscience-themed escape room: Design, implementation, and students' perceptions	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Early Access						Critical thinking; Escape room; Game-based learning; Higher education; Soft skills; Teamwork		Teaching soft skills like team dynamics and critical thinking in content-heavy higher education curriculum can be challenging. Employing educational escape rooms is a novel game-based learning strategy in various disciplines, including health sciences. Escape rooms provide the opportunity for a group to work together as they solve puzzles within a limited time. The skills harnessed and developed within the game by participants are parallel to these soft skills. The present study sought to design a neuroscience-themed physical escape room for the purpose of soft skills development and obtain feedback from undergraduate biomedical or health science students following the completion of the room. Likert-type scale statements in the feedback survey regarding the enjoyability, teamwork development and critical thinking within the game scored positively. Unsurprisingly, the recurring positive theme in the qualitative responses collected revolved around how participants found the activity fun and how it encouraged them to think critically. The present findings suggest that this escape room can in a brief period encourage students to employ communication and teamwork skills and naturally comes with an element of fun, making the experience memorable and engaging.

Low literacy and written drug information: information-seeking, leaflet evaluation and preferences, and roles for images	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY			English	Article						Drug information; Literacy; Legibility; Netherlands; Patient information leaflet; Pictograms; Readability; Visuals	HEALTH LITERACY; ENHANCE RECALL; HEART-FAILURE; MEDICATION; COMPREHENSION; INSTRUCTIONS; PICTOGRAPHS; PICTORIAL; DESIGN; ADULTS	Background Low-literate patients are at risk to misinterpret written drug information. For the (co-) design of targeted patient information, it is key to involve this group in determining their communication barriers and information needs. Objective To gain insight into how people with low literacy use and evaluate written drug information, and to identify ways in which they feel the patient leaflet can be improved, and in particular how images could be used. Setting Food banks and an education institution for Dutch language training in the Netherlands. Method Semi-structured focus groups and individual interviews were held with low-literate participants (n = 45). The thematic framework approach was used for analysis to identify themes in the data. Main outcome measure Low-literate people's experience with patient information leaflets, ideas for improvements, and perceptions on possible uses for visuals. Results Patient information leaflets were considered discouraging to use, and information difficult to find and understand. Many rely on alternative information sources. The leaflet should be shorter, and improved in terms of organisation, legibility and readability. Participants thought images could increase the leaflet's appeal, help ask questions, provide an overview, help understand textual information, aid recall, reassure, and even lead to increased confidence, empowerment and feeling of safety. Conclusion Already at the stages of paying attention to the leaflet and maintaining interest in the message, low-literate patients experience barriers in the communication process through written drug information. Short, structured, visual/textual explanations can lower the motivational threshold to use the leaflet, improve understanding, and empower the low-literate target group.

Design/methodology/approach These four internships were conducted between September 2017 and June 2019 and each internship lasted three to four months. The supervisors for each internship collaborated with local industry partners genuinely interested in adopting sustainable business practices to develop design briefs focussing on real-life challenges they face. The briefs for each internship were developed further according to the feedback of the interns, industry partners and supervisors of previous internships. Findings Five steps of brief making for circular design were identified as reviewing the existing resources, emphasizing the importance of systems thinking, emphasizing the importance of collaboration for the CE, focussing on circularity and communicating expectations. The paper outlines how design briefs changed throughout the consecutive internships according to the different curricula and the characteristics of an educational circular design brief. Originality/value For design educators and researchers, the value of this paper lies in presenting the steps for the brief making of educational circular design projects. Additionally, the characteristics of circular design briefs are outlined, discussing their focus and content to act as a guide for design educators.

Evaluating Spatial Thinking Ability Using Item Response Theory: Differential Item Functioning Across Math Learning Disabilities and Geometry Instructions	LEARNING DISABILITY QUARTERLY			English	Article						three-dimensional printing; differential item functioning; Enhanced Anchored Instruction; geometry instructions; item response theory; math learning disabilities; spatial thinking; problem solving		Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education initiatives have placed pressure on teachers to bring technology tools into classroom, including three-dimensional (3D) printing. Yet, little research has examined what specific math skills are required for 3D printing technology. This article describes a follow-up analysis of findings from a quasi-experimental study that tested feasibility of 3D geometry instruction, Anchored Instruction with Technology Applications (AITA), designed to help students visualize and construct 3D models based on Enhanced Anchored Instruction. Although we found that AITA improved math outcomes of students with math learning disabilities (MLD) in the previous analysis, we only used composite scores encompassing a variety of math and spatial tasks. In this study, we employed item response theory and differential item functioning to examine the impacts of MLD on students' spatial thinking skills, understand the types of items to assess the intended skills in a valid way, and provide a detailed information of whether student ability and MLD status have caused different results to assess students' spatial thinking skills. Results showed that students with MLD struggle to learn spatial thinking skills, and AITA was a significant positive indicator to improve spatial thinking skills for both students with and without MLD.

Minorities with low literacy skills are at a particular disadvantage in obtaining online information. A website was created with health information presented through videos in Amharic and an interface that does not require reading skills to enable users with low/no literacy to navigate among topics. In all, 225 Israeli Ethiopian immigrants were asked to use the website, most with low/no literacy skills. Participants were excited about it, but those with low/no literacy felt they needed support and training for future use. Some felt it was too difficult. The findings point to unexpected potential sociocultural uses for the website for immigrants with different levels of literacy skills. The analysis yielded two user typologies that can help identify user needs and segmentation, a culture-centered adaptation of the technology acceptance model, and implications for communication infrastructure theory.

Preference for Deliberation and Perceived Usefulness of Standard-and Narrative-Style Leaflet Designs: Implications for Equitable Cancer-Screening Communication	ANNALS OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Cancer screening; Colorectal cancer; Decision-making; Dual-process theory; Human information processing	PATIENT NARRATIVES; THINKING; INFORMATION; NEED; COGNITION; NUMERACY; MESSAGE	Background In the UK, cancer-screening invitations are mailed with information styled in a standard, didactic way to allow for informed choice. Information processing theory suggests this "standard style" could be more appealing to people who prefer deliberative thinking. People less likely to engage in deliberative thinking may be disenfranchised by the design of current standard-style information. Purpose To examine the distribution of preference for deliberative thinking across demographic groups (Study 1) and explore associations between preference for deliberative thinking and perceived usefulness of standard-and narrative-style screening information (Study 2). Methods In Study 1, adults aged 45-59 (n = 4,241) were mailed a questionnaire via primary care assessing preference for deliberative thinking and demographic characteristics. In Study 2, a separate cohort of adults aged 45-59 (n = 2,058) were mailed standard- and narrative-style leaflets and a questionnaire assessing demographic characteristics, preference for deliberative thinking, and perceived leaflet usefulness. Data were analyzed using multiple regression. Results In Study 1 (n = 1,783) and Study 2 (n = 650), having lower socioeconomic status, being a women, and being of nonwhite ethnicity was associated with lower preference for deliberative thinking. In Study 2, the standard-style leaflet was perceived as less useful among participants with lower preference for deliberative thinking, while perceived usefulness of the narrative-style leaflet did not differ by preference for deliberative thinking. Conclusions Information leaflets using a standard style may disadvantage women and those experiencing greater socioeconomic deprivation. More work is required to identify design styles that have a greater appeal for people with low preference for deliberative thinking.

The process of design is defined by the abstraction area, which is accompanied by abstract forms of representation for the physical environment in a built environment and the response to problems. Black Box is defined as tool, system, or object that in art and science is evaluated by inputs and outputs and does not include any internal information. The Black Box problem, which is part of the architectural design process, has been reconstructed as a critical stance to the closed and implicit architectural production process, supporting open thought to the end but formally designing houses that remain faithful to this black box. Hence, this article is an example of a physical and semantic representation production with an emphasis on design as a critical action and metaphor. This article, which presents the black box problem through a theoretical perspective and architectural design studio examples, focuses on the semantic and formal representation of all conditions of a cube. This aspect aims to provide a creative cross section from the potential of infinite design.

Here we report the development of highly selective inhibitors of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) family proteins. SUMOylation is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes. Functional differences between two major SUMO isoforms in humans, SUMO1 and SUMO2/3, are thought to arise from distinct interactions mediated by each isoform with other proteins containing SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs). However, the roles of such isoform-specific interactions are largely uncharacterized due in part to the difficulty in generating high-affinity, isoform-specific inhibitors of SUMO/SIM interactions. We first determined the crystal structure of a "monobody," a designed binding protein based on the fibronectin type III scaffold, bound to the yeast homolog of SUMO. This structure illustrated a mechanism by which monobodies bind to the highly conserved SIM-binding site while discriminating individual SUMO isoforms. Based on this structure, we designed a SUMO-targeted library from which we obtained monobodies that bound to the SIM-binding site of human SUMO1 with K(d) values of approximately 100 nM but bound to SUMO2 400 times more weakly. The monobodies inhibited SUMO1/SIM interactions and, unexpectedly, also inhibited SUMO1 conjugation. These high-affinity and isoform-specific inhibitors will enhance mechanistic and cellular investigations of SUMO biology.

How can organizations enhance the persuasiveness of the information security messages used to warn employees of threats and encourage employees to take specific actions to improve their security? We use fear appeal theory and the elaboration likelihood model to argue that security messages presented using more personally relevant language are more likely to induce employees to engage in the recommended protective security behaviors. Our strategy uses organization identification theory to segment employees into two groups and then develops security messages that use language aligned with each of the two segments. We tested this strategy within a large U.S. organization, and found that employees were more likely to consider and act upon messages that used language aligned with their organizational identification than messages using language not aligned. The effect size was large. Our results show that subtly changing less than a dozen words in the way a security message was presented without changing its substantive content (e.g., using "our" instead of "your") has both significant and meaningful effects on how employees think about and respond to it.

The quality of online health information varies and overall is concerning. The definition of eHealth literacy implies that consumers' ability to evaluate online health information varies with their eHealth literacy. A lab-based experiment was conducted to investigate how information source and consumers' eHealth literacy affect their use of different types of indicators and criteria in evaluating the credibility of online health information. Credibility evaluation was viewed as a process of utilizing criteria to interpret webpage indicators. Twenty-five participants each viewed a total of 15 webpages from government, commercial, and online forum sources (five from each). Gaze-cued retrospective think-aloud was employed to elicit the indicators and criteria that participants used to evaluate the webpages. The findings showed that content-related indicators and criteria were used the most in credibility evaluation across different information sources. Participants used source indicators more often than design indicators in evaluating government websites and used design criteria more often than individual factors in evaluating commercial websites. eHealth literacy did not significantly affect credibility evaluation but showed a marginally significant interaction effect with information sources on the number of indicators used. The results enhance our understanding of factors influencing consumer online health information evaluation behavior.

Objectives: This study aims to implement project-based learning to facilitate active and independent learning through project implementation to build students' critical thinking skills and at the same time to facilitate students to achieve competencies in the analytical chemistry required by pharmaceutical and chemical scientists. Materials and Methods: Research includes the development of project packages and the integration of information technology on the topic of Distillation, standardization of learning resources, and implementation of Analytical Chemistry teaching. Results: An innovative project-based learning resource package was successfully developed for the Distillation topic. Implementation of learning resource packages effectively guides students to carry out their own projects in separating target compound contextually through distillation method. The learning facilities available in the learning package have proven to be able in guiding students to design project assignments suit to target analyte. The learning potential of students has been optimized. Students' knowledge and skills in separating target analytes by distillation have been fully mastered as desired in the competency-based curriculum. The results of the assessment showed that the students' critical thinking skills were very good (M = 84.51 +/- 7.41). Student learning outcomes based on the portfolio value of the project proposal (M = 88.46 +/- 6.74) and project reports (M = 92.85 +/- 1.98), and from the objective score of the formative exam (M = 85.59 +/- 3.09) are all classified very good, namely the competence in the analytical field is achieved. Conclusion: Project-based learning innovations are very effective in improving critical thinking skills as well as increasing student competence in the field of analytical chemistry. Recommendation: Project-based learning is suitable for implementation in teaching other subjects to achieve the competencies required by scientists. This learning model is effective in building student competence in a normal learning atmosphere, or when social restrictions are imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study explored primary education teachers' participation in programming practices. By focusing on their views of creating a computational artefact with Scratch, the difficulties encountered, and resources to overcome them in the context of a professional development effort in computer science at the primary education level, was analysed. Employing Thematic Analysis, 17 group documentations (drafts, Scratch projects and final reports) were examined. Findings revealed that projects that had educational content involved more elaborate descriptions, while recreational projects presented a shorter and less elaborate account of the programming process. In terms of difficulties, teachers described initial concerns regarding how to achieve what they had planned, imagined or expected, and they expressed difficulties related to the edition of imported images for objects and scenarios and related to the block-based programming practices. Participants resorted to a great variety of resources to overcome them, which highlights the importance of making testing and debugging practices more explicit. These findings could be relevant for the design of future learning scenarios, highlighting the importance of providing opportunities to develop a critical approach towards expressed commercial promises as well as opportunities to challenge the rhetoric of computational thinking.

There is, therefore, a growing need to measure students' learning of CT in the context of programming and also support all learners through this process of learning computational problem solving. The goal of this research is to explore hypothesis-driven approaches that can be combined with data-driven ones to better interpret student actions and processes in log data captured from block-based programming environments with the goal of measuring and assessing students' CT skills. Informed by past literature and based on our empirical work examining a dataset from the use of the Fairy Assessment in the Alice programming environment in middle schools, we present a framework that formalizes a process where a hypothesis-driven approach informed by Evidence-Centered Design effectively complements data-driven learning analytics in interpreting students' programming process and assessing CT in block-based programming environments. We apply the framework to the design of Alice tasks for high school CS to be used for measuring CT during programming.

Abd			Does the Use of Smart Board Increase Students' Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)?	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Active learning; higher order thinking skills; smart board		Results from international assessments focusing on the use of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) show that Malaysian students perform poorly in Data Handling. At the same time, the Malaysian education system is undergoing a dramatic change in which information and communications technology (ICT) is integrated into the education system in order to enhance the overall quality of education. Smart board has become one of the interactive technology tools that are widely used in schools to facilitate teaching and learning practices. Therefore, this study aims to design and develop an active learning instruction using smart board (ALuSB program) to enhance HOTS in Data Handling among students in Malaysian primary schools. The research was divided into two stages. In the first stage, the ALuSB program was developed by using the ADDIE model which integrated five phases, i.e., analysis, design, development, implement, and evaluate. Then, in the second stage, the quasi-experimental design, a non-equivalent control group design with a pre-test and a post-test, was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the ALuSB program on students' HOTS. The students were split into three groups equally, i.e., two experimental groups and one control group. Various instruments, including an ALuSB program evaluation form as well as pre-test and post-test rubrics, were used. The results of the analysis suggest that there is a statistically significant difference between the ALuSB program, an active learning instruction and a conventional learning method in enhancing each level of HOTS in Data Handling among students. Although all students from each group show improvements in enhancing HOTS in Data Handling, the ALuSB program is the most effective method compared to the active learning instruction and the conventional learning method. Therefore, the ALuSB program promotes students' active learning and ownership of learning, supports learning by doing, as well as encourages HOTS and peer sharing.

Some approaches address people's experiences of creativity. The present method measures creativity, across conditions, in the products that people make. This research introduces information-based ideation (IBI), a paradigm for investigating open-ended tasks and activities in which users develop new ideas. IBI tasks span imagining, planning, and reflecting on a weekend, vacation, outfit, makeover, paper, internship, thesis, design, campaign, crisis response, career, or invention. What products do people create through engagement in IBI? Curation of digital media incorporates conceptualization, finding and choosing information objects, annotation, and synthesis. Through engagement in IBI tasks, people create curation products. This article formulates a quantitative methodology for evaluating IBI support tools, building on prior creative cognition research in engineering design to derive a battery of ideation metrics of curation. Elemental ideation metrics evaluate creativity within curated found objects. Holistic ideation metrics evaluate how a curation puts elements together. IBI support environments are characterized by their underlying medium of curation. Curation media include lists, such as listicles, and grids, such as the boards of Pinterest. An in-depth case study investigates information composition, an art-based medium representing a curation as a freeform visual semantic connected whole. We raise two creative cognition challenges for IBI. One challenge is overcoming fixation-for instance, when a person gets stuck in a counterproductive mental set. The other challenge is to bridge information visualization's synthesis gap, by providing support for connecting findings. To address the challenges, we develop mixed-initiative information composition ((MIC)-C-2), integrating human curation of information composition with automated agents of information retrieval and visualization. We hypothesize that (MIC)-C-2 generates provocative stimuli that help users overcome fixation to become more creative on IBI tasks. We hypothesize that (MIC)-C-2's integration of curation and visualization bridges the synthesis gap to help users become more creative. To investigate these hypotheses, we apply ideation metrics of curation to interpret results from experiments with 44 and 49 participants.

Design/methodology/approach - Close-reading of selected texts, historiography, and case studies in current developments in the Monte Carlo method of high-energy particle physics (HEP) for developing a platform for bridging the apparently incommensurable differences between the physical-mathematical and the biological sciences. Findings - First, usefulness of the cybernetic approach for historicizing the Monte Carlo method in relation to digital computing and quantum physics. Second, development of an inter/trans-disciplinary approach to the hard sciences through a critical re-evaluation of the historical texts of von Foerster and von Neumann for application to developments in quantum theory, biophysics, and computing. Research limitations/implications - This work is largely theoretical and uses dialectical thought experiments to engage between sciences operating across different ontological scales. Practical implications - Consideration of developments of quantum computing and how that would change one's perception of information, data, and the way in which analysis is currently performed with big data. Originality/value - This is the first time that von Neumann and von Foerster have been contrasted and compared in relation to their epistemic compatibility, historical importance, and relevance for producing a creative approach to current scientific epistemology. This paper hopes to change how the authors view trans-disciplinary/inter-disciplinary practices in the sciences and produce new vistas of thought in the history and philosophy of science.

With the designation Thinking-Back-and-Forth (TBF)we present a framework with a taxonomy of TBF activities. Purpose Aim was to gain insight how teachers stimulate and support their students in TBF. Detailed information about what teachers do and what limitations they experience, provides insight into how they pay attention to TBF and how this can be improved. Sample Nineteen Dutch physics and chemistry teachers in grades 8 and 9. Design and Methods Based on the TBF framework an observation instrument was developed to analyse activities and teacher behaviour. 19 practical science lessons were observed and teachers were interviewed about their behaviour and the learning activities they pursue regarding TBF. Results Overall, teachers seem to consider practical work primarily from the point of view of conducting an experiment. They encourage TBF predominantly by having their students draw conclusions or generate explanations. Assigning tasks to design experiments or generate predictions is less common and activities fostering discussions are rarely observed. Insufficient hands-on and minds-on student abilities as well as limited time available are seen as impediments. Another major impediment is teachers' lack of cognizance of possible TBF activities while designing practical lessons. ConclusionS Teachers have a positive attitude towards TBF. They indicated that the TBF framework with the taxonomy of activities functioned as a reflection tool to think more consciously about their lessons and offers the possibility to improve existing practical work. This indicates that the TBF framework can be used by teachers and teacher-educators to provide more diverse student activities to connect hands-on to minds-on. This study also showed that cognizance about designing and implementing TBF activities in practical work needs to be improved in both pre-service and in-service teacher training.

J	Battail, G				Battail, Gerard			Applying Semiotics and Information Theory to Biology: A Critical Comparison	BIOSEMIOTICS			English	Article						Biosemiotics; Error-correcting codes; Heredity; Information theory; Semantics		Since the beginning of the XX-th century, it became increasingly evident that information, besides matter and energy, is a major actor in the life processes. Moreover, communication of information has been recognized as differentiating living things from inanimate ones, hence as specific to the life processes. Therefore the sciences of matter and energy, chemistry and physics, do not suffice to deal with life processes. Biology should also rely on sciences of information. A majority of biologists, however, did not change their mind and continued to describe life in terms of chemistry and physics. They merely borrowed some vocabulary from the information sciences. The first science of information available to biological applications, semiotics, appeared at the end of the XIX-th century. It is a qualitative and descriptive science which stemmed from efforts of linguists and philosophers to understand the human language and is thus mainly concerned with semantics. Applying semiotics to biology resulted in today's Biosemiotics. Independently, an explosive expansion of communication engineering began in the second half of the XX-th century. Besides tremendous progresses in hardware technology, it was made possible by the onset of a science of literal communication: Information Theory (Shannon, Bell Syst Tech J 27:379-457, 623-656, 1948). Literal communication consists of faithfully transporting a message from a place to another, or from an instant to another. Because the meaning of a message does not matter for its transportation, information theory ignores semantics. This restriction enables defining information as a measurable quantity on which a mathematical theory of communication is founded. Although lacking implementation means at its beginning, information theory became later very successful for designing communication means. Modern ones, like mobile phones, can be thought of as experimentally proving the relevance and accuracy of information theory since their design and operation heavily rely on it. Information theory is plainly relevant to biological functions which involve literal communication, especially heredity. This paper is intended to compare the two approaches. It shows that, besides obvious differences, they have some points in common: for instance, the quantitative measurement of information obeys Peirce's triadic paradigm. They also can mutually enlighten each other. Using information theory, which is closer to the basic communication mechanisms, may appear as a preliminary step prior to more elaborated investigations. Criticizing genetics from outside, information theory furthermore reveals that the ability of the template-replication paradigm to faithfully conserve genomes is but a prejudice. Heredity actually demands error-correcting means which impose severe constraints to the living world and must be recognized as biological facts.

Evolution operates at the microscopic level; in organizations, this is the individual or agent. Each agent has an idiosyncratic view of the organization, using to some extent personal constructs in dealing with the reality of organizational life. These objects or constructs can be described and measured by most agents; they are well defined. Many of these objects are represented in electronic, IT systems. Each agent also has their own view as to how they know what they know, that is, their epistemology, which we argue is their IS, and is wider than the IT systems they use. The IS of each agent co-evolves, by interaction with other agents, based on the agent's view of reality. The interaction of all agents constitutes the organization. Even more importantly, different values and interests motivate each agent. This is their axiology and it is what motivates them to learn and to develop their IS. An agent-based axiological framework is essential to understanding the evolution of organizations. It is the interaction of agents that builds consensus as to the shared reality of the organization, and this affects each agent's ability and motivation to evolve IS further. In addition, we propose that it is time that IT systems included modelling capabilities, based on multi-agent representations of the organization and its context, to explore and support strategic thinking and decision making.

J	Chang, SC; Wongwatkit, C				Chang, Shao-Chen; Wongwatkit, Charoenchai			Effects of a peer assessment-based scrum project learning system on computer programming's learning motivation, collaboration, communication, critical thinking, and cognitive load	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Early Access						Computer programming; Higher order thinking; Scrum project; Peer assessment; Collaborative learning	STUDENTS PERCEPTIONS; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; SCHOOL; FEEDBACK; SKILLS; GAME; AWARENESS; BEHAVIOR; SCRATCH	As computational thinking becomes increasingly essential, the challenge of designing effective teaching approaches to foster students' abilities in this area persists, especially for higher order thinking skills. This study addresses this challenge by proposing and implementing a peer assessment-based Scrum project (PA-SP) learning approach in university computer programming learning. The approach involves dividing 98 third-year college students into an experimental group, which employs the PA-SP approach, and a control group, which uses the conventional Scrum project (C-SP) approach. The study investigates the impact of the PA-SP approach on students' programming projects, learning motivation, project collaboration, communication, critical thinking, and cognitive load. The results demonstrate that the PA-SP approach significantly enhances learning achievement and motivation while also improving collaboration, communication, and critical thinking. By providing practical insights into effective teaching strategies to promote students' computational thinking, this research has significant implications for improving programming education in universities.

Tobacco industry document studies identify alliances between the alcohol and tobacco industries to counter U.S. policies in the 1980s and 1990s. This investigation sought to study in-depth inter-relationships between MBC and PM, with a particular focus on alcohol policy issues. We used the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents library to trace the evolution of corporate affairs and related alcohol policy orientated functions within and between MBC and PM. Results MBC was structured and led by PM senior executives from soon after takeover in 1970. Corporate Affairs sought to influence public perceptions of alcohol to align them with business interests. Alcohol education was specifically designed to prevent the adoption of policies inimical to those interests (e.g., raising excise taxes). Strategic consideration of alcohol policy issues was integrated within company-wide thinking, which sought to apply lessons from tobacco to alcohol and vice versa. PM directly led key alcohol industry organisations nationally and globally, which have successfully delayed the adoption and implementation of known effective policy measures in the U.S. and worldwide. Conclusions PM has been a key architect of alcohol industry political strategies. This study builds on earlier work on alcohol companies in the tobacco documents, and offers historical data on how tobacco companies have used commercial involvements in other sectors to influence wider public health policy.

J	Ioannou, A; Makridou, E				Ioannou, Andri; Makridou, Eria			Exploring the potentials of educational robotics in the development of computational thinking: A summary of current research and practical proposal for future work	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Computational thinking; Educational robotics; Robotics in education	DESIGN; FRAMEWORK	Educational robotics are increasingly appearing in educational settings, being considered a useful supporting tool for the development of cognitive skills, including Computational Thinking (CT), for students of all ages. Meanwhile, there is an overwhelming argument that CT will be a fundamental skill needed for all individuals by the middle of the twenty-first century and thus, should be cultivated in the early school years, as part of the child's analytical thinking and as a principal component of Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics (STEM) education. This study reviews published literature at the intersection of CT and educational robotics, particularly focused on the use of educational robotics for advancing students' CT skills in K-12. The reviewed articles reveal initial evidence suggesting that educational robotics can foster students' cognitive and social skills. The paper discusses specific areas for further inquiry by learning researchers and learning practitioners. Such inquiry should start from a widely agreed definition of CT and validated measurement instruments for its assessment. A practical framework for the development of CT via robotics is next in demand, so as instructional designers and educators can implement it consistently and at scale.

J	Gorichanaz, T				Gorichanaz, Tim			There's no shortcut: Building understanding from information in ultrarunning	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Phenomenology; ultrarunning; understanding		Now that information proliferates, information science should turn its attention towards higher order epistemic aims, such as understanding. Before systems to support the building of understanding can be designed, the process of building understanding must be explored. This article discusses the findings from an interpretative phenomenological analysis study on the information experience of participants in a 100-mile footrace which reveal how these participants have built understanding in their athletic pursuits. Three ways in which ultrarunners build understanding - by taking time, by undergoing struggle and by incorporating multiple perspectives - are described. The ensuing discussion leads to three questions that can guide the future development of information systems that support understanding: First, how can information science slow people down? Second, how can information science encourage people to willingly struggle? And, third, how can information science stimulate analogical thinking?

J	Keilty, P; Leazer, G				Keilty, Patrick; Leazer, Gregory			Feeling documents: toward a phenomenology of information seeking	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Information retrieval; Computers; Aesthetics; Information seeking; Affect; Desire; Pornography	RELEVANCE CRITERIA; RETRIEVAL; SCIENCE; PERSPECTIVE; CONTEXT	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present two models of human cognition. The first narrow model concentrates on the mind as an information-processing apparatus, and interactions with information as altering thought structures and filling gaps in knowledge. A second model incorporates elements of unconsciousness, embodiment and affect. The selection of one model over the other, often done tacitly, has consequences for subsequent models of information seeking and use. Design/methodology/approach A close reading of embodied engagements with pornography guided by existential phenomenology. Findings The paper develops a phenomenology of information seeking, centered primarily around the work of Merleau-Ponty, to justify a more expansive concept of cognition. The authors demonstrate the roles of affect and embodiment in document assessment and use, with a prolonged example in the realm of browsing pornography. Originality/value Models of information seeking and use need to account for diverse kinds of human-document interaction, to include documents such as music, film and comics that engage the emotions or are perceived through a broader band of sensory experience to include visual and auditory components. The authors consider how those human-document engagements form virtual communities based on the similarity of their members' affective and embodied responses, which in turn inform the arrangements, through algorithms, of the relations of documents to each other. Less instrumental forms of information seeking and use - ones that incorporate elements of embodiment and affect - are characterized as esthetic experiences, following the definition of the esthetic provided by Dewey. Ultimately the authors consider, given the ubiquity of information seeking and its rhythm in everyday life, whether we can meaningfully characterize information seeking as a distinct human process.

The developments in the field of science and technology and the changing needs of society necessitate an update to the Information Technologies and Software course curriculum and its implementation, starting from the 2021-2022 academic year. With this update, students are provided with the means to take the first step toward programming with block-based learning activities (Blockly, Scratch, Arduino, etc.). For this reason, it is thought that previously developed scales may be insufficient to measure students' attitudes toward the updated Information Technologies and Software course. The study was designed by survey method. A total of 600 students for an exploratory factor analysis and 300 different students for a confirmatory factor analysis were included in the study. As a result of conducting the exploratory factor analysis, a scale with 4 factors and 27 items was obtained. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to confirm the obtained structure. The scale that was developed, as a result of validity and reliability studies, is thought to be a valid and reliable measurement tool that can be used to measure attitudes toward the Information Technologies and Software course.

Eventually, the characteristic of digital era is the "softening of the theories and hardening of the experiences". Subjective information is widely used in digital revolution for transforming the qualitative estimations into quasi-quantitative solutions, such as the empirical methods in decision making for quantitative management, etc., it will be the transferor for realizing it. The theoretical formulation of how subjective information is digitized through "Fuzzy-AI Model" for digital revolution is presented in this paper; it has becoming a universal problem solver of utilizing AI technology for quantizing the degree uncertainties in decision-making and fuzzy estimation. Besides, the "Big Data" searching will heavily depend on the completeness of its source information, yet "subjective information" approach can directly predict human thinking or the internal law of complicated objective events into an explicit digital form, for the completeness of source information to make the correct and comprehensive "Big Data" prediction possible.

While there is abundance of tools for creativity, technical information has never been implemented as inspiration for ideas. In this paper, to answer the demand of creativity tools with real practice, we created magic-based inspirational cards that contain technical clues of how each magic effect can be created in products. Two versions of the tools were compared: Magic cards (only illustration of magic effects) and Technical cards (illustration of magic effects with additional technical clues). The tools were evaluated with thirty novice designers in two design sessions. In the first session, they were asked to generate design ideas in a design task. Then a week later, they were divided into three groups, control group, Magic cards, and Technical cards. The experimental groups were asked to use the cards as a source of inspiration and to generate design ideas in the same design task. The ideas generated by the participants were assessed in terms of creativity and intended user experience (UX). The findings show that the use of both types of magic-based cards resulted in significantly higher scores in originality and flexibility of ideation. Also, the use of Technical cards led to significantly higher intended UX scores. The analysis of products' behaviors (outputs) showed a significant increase of physical outputs when magic-based inspiration is provided. Our study suggested that, for novice design students, the Magic Effects set together with technological clues could enhance creativity in ideation.

J	Raza, SA				Raza, Syed Arshad			Managing ethical requirements elicitation of complex socio-technical systems with critical systems thinking: A case of course-timetabling project	TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Requirements engineering; Requirements elicitation; Critical systems thinking; Boundary critique; Ethical problem-solving; Socio-technical systems	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; DECISION-SUPPORT; ENGINEERING SYSTEMS; DESIGN; TECHNOLOGY; PRINCIPLES; ORGANIZATIONS; KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION; SCIENCE	Complex socio-technical systems pose considerable challenges to requirements elicitation due to dynamic boundary conditions and conflicting perspectives. Traditional requirements engineering is criticized for its failure in providing a systemic view, overlooking ethical concerns and marginalized social perspectives. It is argued that educational institutions as a part of society need to ethically develop and manage their academic processes and consider such perspectives for emancipation. This critical qualitative research applies the emancipatory systemic methodology of critical systems thinking (CST) for the requirements elicitation of a complex and dynamic university course-timetables management problem. Firstly, the problem is ethically formulated to mitigate Type III errors. Secondly, multiple viewpoints are sought for boundary judgments using a CST-based ethical inquiry of boundary critique to reveal the normative content of the project design, explore imbalances amongst the socio-technical design components, and unveil the underlying ethical issues. The dynamic stakeholder network captures the system's emergence through stakeholder interconnectedness and boundary liquidity by sweeping-in relevant stakeholders through the continuum of various states of the project. This work enlightens requirements engineering by coupling systemic and socio-technical lenses for the elicitation of ethical requirements and the emancipation of marginalized perspectives in complex and dynamic information systems projects in general and timetabling problems, in particular.

While the article is prescriptive rather than empirical, it offers new directions for instructors who wish to adopt an action research approach to syllabus development. Information systems developers perform two roles in the process of managing a development project: the developer is both analyst/designer and facilitator. Traditional textbooks for systems analysis and design courses emphasize the analyst/designer role, but say little about the facilitator role. We have developed course materials and teaching methods to address facilitation skills: outcome thinking, group process, and communications. We also emphasize some analyst/designer skills that are not addressed in the traditional texts, such as creative thinking, socio-technical systems, and CASE tool concepts. Our teaching methods include the personal journal, which allows students to tailor classroom materials to their own needs, as well as other methods for providing experiential learning of course materials.

However, there is a paucity of research in terms of in-depth exploration of the cognitive patterns and dynamic design processes of co-design with user participation in the existing design cognition research. The current study aimed to investigate the cognition activities involved in the process of co-design between user and designer at both the individual and team levels. The combination method of linkography and the situated function-behavior-structure (FBS) co-design model was carried out to encode and analyze the protocol data. The results showed that, at the individual level, designers and users adopted different design strategies to promote the progress of the design. In addition, the interaction activities among users and designers varied in different co-design processes. However, at the team level, the collaborators showed systematic thinking modes, and each design move was two-way. This cognitive strategy of the innovation team ensured the continuity and effectiveness of the co-design process. Theoretically, these findings will bring new insights for studies on team cognition activities and contribute to building user-centric design theory by uncovering the dynamic design processes of co-design with user participatory. In addition, the study makes a methodological contribution by illustrating how linkography and the situated FBS co-design model can be utilized to analyze the team cognition during co-design activities.

J	Jacob, SR; Montoya, J; Warschauer, M				Jacob, Sharin Rawhiya; Montoya, Jonathan; Warschauer, Mark			Exploring the Intersectional Development of Computer Science Identities in Young Latinas	TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD			English	Article						computer science; computational thinking; identity; intersectionality; multilingual; English learner; language learner	STUDENT	Background: There has been a dearth of research on intersectional identities in STEM, including the fields of computing and engineering. In computing education research, much work has been done on broadening participation, but there has been little investigation into how the field of computer science (CS) presents opportunities for students with strong intersectional identities. This study explores the strengths and connections among the unique identities and the symbiotic relationships that elementary Latina students hold in CS identity attainment. Purpose: The aim of this article is to better understand how predominantly low-income, multilingual Latina students experience identity development through the lens of diverse group membership. We examine how young Latinas, through their participation in a yearlong culturally and linguistically responsive CS curriculum, leverage their intersecting identities to rewrite the formula of what a computer scientist is and can be, leaving space to include and invite other strong identities as well. Research Design: An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used that analyzed data from predominantly low-income, multilingual Latinas in upper elementary grades, including pre- and post-CS identity surveys (N = 50) delivered before and after implementation of the curriculum, and eight individual semi-structured student interviews. Findings: We found that Latina students developed significantly stronger identification with the field of CS from the beginning to the end of the school year with regard to their experiences with CS, perception of themselves as computer scientists, family support for CS and school, and friend support for CS and school. Interviews revealed that perception of their CS ability greatly influenced identification with CS and that girls' self-perceptions stemmed from their school, cultural, and home learning environments. Conclusion: Our results highlight the wealth of resources that Latinas bring to the classroom through their home- and community-based assets, which are characterized by intersecting group membership. Students did not report on the intersection between language and CS identity development, which warrants further investigation.

Yet, little is known about how to foster teachers' own CT-skills and attitudes towards teaching CT. In a quasi-experimental study (N = 54), we investigated whether a three-session teacher training on (teaching) CT (n = 32) positively affected higher education teachers' CT-skills and their attitudes towards teaching CT compared to a control condition (n = 22). The training consisted of explicit instruction on common reasoning biases combined with assignments focused on the teaching practice. Results showed that the training improved teachers' performance on trained but not on novel CT-tasks. Also teachers' ability to detect biases in a written student product improved; however, despite a small improvement, they still had difficulties in correctly explaining those biases. Possibly due to ceiling effects the training did not affect perceived relevance of teaching CT. Finally, perceived competence in teaching CT decreased temporarily after the first training session but this negative effect disappeared after the final third session. Future research should investigate ways to promote teachers' ability to transfer trained skills to other CT-tasks, their ability provide feedback on students' reasoning (i.e., bias explanation), and their attitudes towards teaching CT.

Designing simulation games are the result of creative thinking and planning, but often not the result of a rigorously applied design method. Design methods can be used to structure the creative process. The specific types of games we chose for studying design methods are simulation games focused on information-intensive domains, of which logistics management is an example. Our new design method takes into account the information intensiveness of the domain. The design method incorporates enterprise information management, simulation model design, and instructional design. The design method we propose uses ten steps in designing a simulation game: the first five for making a conceptual design and the final five for using the conceptual design as a basis for the simulation game. Iterative cycles are added to improve intermediate results. This paper discusses the design method and presents two different case studies. The first case study helped in developing the design method, while the second case study served for assessment and improvement.

However, as with any representation of complex disciplinary information, learning to correctly interpret phylogenies can be challenging, requiring that a diversity of educational strategies be deployed. Representational competence is the ability to develop and effectively use abstract representations. Accurately interpreting a phylogenetic tree as a presentation of evolutionary relationships requires that students develop general representational competence as well as knowledge of specific technical aspects of tree interpretation, such as knowing the graphical components of trees and what they represent. Here, we report on the development of a basic diagnostic tool of students' representational competence and technical skills with phylogenies, the Basic Evolutionary Tree-Thinking Skills Instrument (BETTSI). This short, multiple-choice instrument was designed to provide instructors with a quick diagnostic of students' ability to read and interpret phylogenies. It has been checked for reliability and validity and provides a convenient formative and summative assessment of students' understanding of evolutionary trees.

Through a two-stage literature collection and selection process, 29 articles were included in the meta-analysis, 31 independent effect sizes (16 of UA and 15 of PE) from these articles were used, and a total of 2,764 participants were involved in these studies. CMA software version 3.3 was used to analyze the collected data. The result of the meta-analysis showed that both the UA and PE teaching approaches are useful in cultivating students' CT. Besides, the effect of the PE teaching approach is better than the UA teaching approach in CT education. Moreover, we analyzed the effect of moderator variables (grade level, interdisciplinary course, and experiments duration) on the relationship between UA or PE and CT education. The results showed that the effects of UA teaching approach in CT education was stronger (a) for primary school students than for secondary school students, (b) in interdisciplinary courses than in computer science courses, (c) with long duration teaching experiments than with medium and short duration teaching experiments. However, these effects are not significant. The effects of the PE teaching approach in CT education were stronger (a) for secondary school students than for primary school students, (b) in interdisciplinary courses than in computer science courses, (c) with short duration teaching experiments than with long and medium duration teaching experiments. These effects are not significant either. Therefore, we suggest that (1) the UA teaching approach should be used more for primary school students, while the PE teaching approach should be used more for secondary students; (2) CT education should be integrated into other subjects through UA and PE teaching approaches, and (3) the UA teaching approach requires more teaching time than the PE teaching approach does in CT education.

This study's aim was to evaluate Chinese medical students' disposition for CT and to explore the impact of current trends in medical education on students' CT development. Methods We used multistage stratified cluster sampling to recruit a total of 1241 medical students among five different years of training and from three medical institutions in China. The Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory-Chinese Version (CTDI-CV) and self-reported information were used to collect cross-sectional data. Based on the data from the CTDI-CV, 112 medical students in clinical course training from a single institution continued one-year follow-up. Their one-year CTDI-CV score changes were collected regarding various medical education variables. Results The mean CTDI-CV score of the 1241 medical students was 287.04 with 729 (58.7%) students receiving a score of 280 or higher. There were statistically significant differences in schools attended(F = 3.84, P < 0.05), year of school attended(F = 10.32, P < 0.001), GPA(F = 6.32, P < 0.01), weekly time spent learning after class(F = 14.14, P < 0.001), attitude toward medicine(F = 28.93, P < 0.001), desire to be a doctor after graduation(t = - 3.35, P < 0.001), familiarity with CT(F = 20.40, P < 0.001), and perception of importance of CT(F = 22.25, P < 0.001). The participants scored the highest on the CTDI-CV subscales of "inquisitiveness" and the lowest on "truth seeking." The 112 students in the longitudinal study had significantly lower total CT scores after one academic year follow-up. Conclusions Chinese medical students generally exhibited positive CT dispositions. The cross-sectional survey and one-year longitudinal study indicated that students' CT disposition diminished as they progressed through traditional medical training. Our study contributes to understanding the status of Chinese medical education of and influential factors on medical students' CT disposition.

In order to support health workers' decision-making, we engaged with partners in Cote d'Ivoire, Mozambique and Nigeria in a research project to conceive, design, produce, implement and test paper-based health information tools: the PHISICC tools. Our aim was to understand the use of PHISICC tools by health workers and to improve them based on their feedback. MethodsThe design Health Facility Laboratories (HF Labs) in Cote d'Ivoire and in Nigeria were set up after months of use of PHISICC tools. Activities were structured in three phases or 'sprints' of co-creative research. We used a transdisciplinary approach, including anthropology and Human Centered Design (HCD), observations, shadowing, structured interviews and co-creation. ResultsHealth workers appreciated the standardization of the tools across different health care areas, with a common visual language that optimized use. Several design issues were raised, in terms of formats and contents. They strongly appreciated how the PHISICC registers guided their clinical decision-making and how it facilitated tallying and counting for monthly reporting. However, adherence to new procedures was not universal. The co-creation sessions resulted in modifications to the PHISICC tools of out-patient care and postnatal care. DiscussionAlthough health systems and systemic thinking allowed the teams to embrace complexity, it was the HCD approach that actually produced a shift in researchers' mind-set: from HIS as data management tools to HIS as quality of care instruments. HCD allowed navigating the complexity of health systems interventions due to its capacity to operate change: it not only allowed us to understand how the PHISICC tools were used but also how to further improve them. In the absence of (or even with) an analytical health systems framework, HCD approaches can work in real-life situations for the ideation, testing and implementation of interventions to improve health systems and health status outcomes.

However, ensuring adherence remains a barrier when designing mHealth concepts for adolescents.Objective This study aimed to explore barriers and facilitators for adhering to mHealth interventions to inform design principles.Methods: Think-aloud tests were conducted with 12 adolescents (aged 12.5 years median) with knee pain, using a low-fidelity prototype. The prototype was informed by the authors previous work, rapid prototyping sessions with seven health professionals, and synthesis via the Behavioral Intervention Technology Model. The think-aloud tests were video recorded and analyzed thematically to identify design principles.Results: The analysis based on user testing with adolescents with knee pain identified three themes: "user experience and feedback," "contextual challenges," and "new features" and nine subthemes. Adolescents were able to use mHealth behavioral features such as self-tracking, goal setting, education, and data visualization to capture and reflect on their knee pain developments, which facilitated use. However, adolescents struggle with timing interventions, breaking down management behaviors, and biases towards interventions were identified as internal threats to adherence. Competing activities, parental meddling, and privacy concerns were external adherence barriers. Twelve design principles were identified for integrating these insights into mHealth designs.Conclusion: Participants' motivations for adherence were influenced by internal and external factors. While adolescents were able to use mHealth behavioral features to capture and reflect on knee pain developments, understanding how to accommodate adolescents' cognitive abilities, competing activities, and need for independence is quintessential to enhance adherence in everyday contexts.

The lack of effective instruments to measure critical thinking disposition in medical students has become an obstacle for training and evaluating students in undergraduate programs in China. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the CTDA test.MethodsA total of 278 students participated in this study and responded to the CTDA test. Cronbach's alpha coefficient, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, floor effects and ceiling effects were measured to assess the reliability of the questionnaire. Construct validity of the pre-specified three-domain structure of the CTDA was evaluated by explanatory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The convergent validity and discriminant validity were also analyzed.ResultsCronbach's alpha coefficient for the entire questionnaire was calculated to be 0.92, all of the domains showed acceptable internal consistency (0.81-0.86), and the test-retest reliability indicated acceptable intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) (0.93, p<0.01). The EFA and the CFA demonstrated that the three-domain model fitted the data adequately. The test showed satisfactory convergent and discriminant validity.ConclusionsThe CTDA is a reliable and valid questionnaire to evaluate the disposition of medical students towards critical thinking in China and can reasonably be applied in critical thinking programs and medical education research.

The research was actualized by experimental and qualitative research methods. In the experimental method "pre-test and post-test control group design" was used. During the qualitative research focus group interview has been performed together with the document analysis. In the comparison of the RTTS post-test point average of experiment and control group, it was found a statistically significant difference in favor of the experiment group in the sub dimensions of "open minded" "(t = 2.71, p < 0.05) and "questioning effective teaching" (t = 2.09, p < 0.05). There is a difference in favor of the experiment group in the average of the other sub-dimension namely "researcher", "looking professional", "teaching responsibility and being scientific", "being visionary and candid", "constant target thinking" but it was not found statistically significant. The view of the students about the activity and group work are gathered under ten themes namely individual evaluation, new idea development, task sharing, being active, learning the group work, the pleasure of success, being willing and involved, interaction between groups, pantomime, meeting, contraction and dialogue. During the research, systematic teaching improved reflective thinking of the students in general. The systematic teaching has provided permanence in the dimensions of "Looking professional", "Teaching responsibility and being scientific", "Questioning and efficient teaching" "Constant and intentional thought". Systematic teaching has made a positive difference on the experimental group in the post-test applied to the pre-service teachers but consistent was not maintained. Assessment of analysis and evaluation levels in further researched will give new information to the researches about the efficiency of the systematic teaching.

Integrating Menominee model for sustainable forestry with Systems Thinking competency through 3D virtual tours	SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE			English	Article						Sustainability competencies; Landscape visualization; Systems Thinking; Bloom's Taxonomy; Indigenous knowledge; Sustainability model	HIGHER-EDUCATION; LANDSCAPE VISUALIZATION; KEY COMPETENCES; MANAGEMENT; TOOL; RETHINKING; DESIGN; SKILLS	Sustainability competencies enable planners, the public, local communities, academics, and development practitioners to address environmental challenges, better envision the future and devise practical solutions. A key competency in this framework is Systems Thinking, allowing individuals to think comprehensively at different temporal and spatial scales. Among all interested groups, local and Indigenous communities play a significant role in preserving the sustainability of the natural environment and co-producing knowledge based on traditional ecological knowledge. Hence, new approaches are needed to integrate traditional ecological values into competency-based practices to articulate problems and related solutions. This project introduces place-based scenarios rooted in conventional forest management concerning two identified subsets of Bloom's Taxonomy, Remembering and Understanding, including some competencies necessary for thinking systemically. Overall, 57 participants, including students and staff of the College of Menominee Nation and Menominee community members, in northeast Wisconsin, USA, randomly experienced two visual tools with the same information presented as either: a website with simple 2D images or a 3D virtual tour to investigate which visualization method can help better articulate systems, their components, and behaviors. Participants answered two kinds of questionnaires based on either cognitive mapping or reflection on place-based scenarios. The results show that 3D virtual tour users better demonstrated proficiency in Remembering and Understanding compared to users who experienced the 2D website. Our results thus highlight the potential for 3D virtual experiences to enable sustainability competencies. However, given the observed differences among age and educational groups, future visualization tools and associated research methods should attend to audiences' competencies, preferences, and comfort, especially among older age groups.

J	Bian, JY; Ji, Y				Bian, Jianying; Ji, Ying			Research on the Teaching of Visual Communication Design Based on Digital Technology	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article								In the era of big data, the rapid development of information technology has made the sharing of data and information more free, bringing convenience to the public, but at the same time, the massive amount of data also brings "information anxiety." In this paper, we use the knowledge of design discipline, combined with psychological cognitive science, statistics, and communication discipline, and analyze a large number of excellent cases to effectively combine "information visualization-visual representation-design." The purpose of this study is to enable audiences to efficiently access information through visual symbols in a large amount of data and to increase their interest in reading and satisfaction in accessing information. As a carrier of communication between designers and audiences in the process of visual representation of information visualization, visual symbols can effectively convey information content and emotional concepts to audiences. Finally, based on the theoretical support of the previous paper, combined with our own practical experience, we conduct a systematic study on the application of design thinking and the construction of design methods for the design of visual representations of information visualization. A comparative study on the aesthetics of different categories of APP interface design is conducted, and it is believed that different categories of APP can create distinctive and different categories of APP interface aesthetics through the differentiated design of interface layout, content expression, and visual form, which is considered as the ultimate goal that APP interface design must pursue. Visual representation is a method and means to realize information visualization as a representation practice that expresses the meaning of information in the form of visual symbols. The visual representation of information visualization uses visual symbols as a medium, and the audience interprets the visual symbols based on cognitive experience to obtain information, which helps to maximize the dissemination of information.

J	Kahraman, C				Kahraman, C			An application of fuzzy linear regression to the information technology in Turkey	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						forecasting, fuzzy sets; linear regression; inflation; information technology	MODEL	Fuzzy set theory deals with the vagueness of human thought. A major contribution of fuzzy set theory is its capability of representing vague knowledge. Fuzzy set theory is very practical when sufficient and reliable data isn't available. Information Technology (IT) is the acquisition, processing, storage and dissemination of information in all its forms (auditory, pictorial, textual and numerical) through a combination of computers, telecommunication, networks and electronic devices. IT includes matters concerned with the furtherance of computer science and technology, design, development, installation and implementation of information systems and applications. In the paper, assuming that there are n independent variables and the regression function is linear, the possible levels of information technology (the sale levels of computer equipment) in Turkey will be forecasted by using fuzzy linear regression. The independent variables assumed will be the import level and the export level of computer equipment.

Overall, 57 participants, including students and staff of the College of Menominee Nation and Menominee community members, in northeast Wisconsin, USA, randomly experienced two visual tools with the same information presented as either: a website with simple 2D images or a 3D virtual tour to investigate which visualization method can help better articulate systems, their components, and behaviors. Participants answered two kinds of questionnaires based on either cognitive mapping or reflection on place-based scenarios. The results show that 3D virtual tour users better demonstrated proficiency in Remembering and Understanding compared to users who experienced the 2D website. Our results thus highlight the potential for 3D virtual experiences to enable sustainability competencies. However, given the observed differences among age and educational groups, future visualization tools and associated research methods should attend to audiences' competencies, preferences, and comfort, especially among older age groups.

Objectives: Based on the findings of several studies suggesting that critical thinking does not affect problem-solving, this study aimed to examine the relationship among critical thinking, self-directed learning, and problem-solving in student nurses attending online classes, and to determine whether self-directed learning could mediate the relationship between critical thinking and problem-solving. Design: Cross-sectional, descriptive design. Setting: K University in South Korea. Participants: In total, 138 junior and senior nursing students were enrolled. Methods: The critical thinking disposition scale for nursing students, self-directed learning scale, and problem-solving scale for college students were used to quantify participants' responses. Results: Our results revealed significant positive correlations among critical thinking, self-directed learning, and problem-solving. Furthermore, self-directed learning (beta = 0.78, p < 0.001) had a significant mediating effect on the relationship between critical thinking and problem-solving ability (Z = 5.10, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Developing and implementing appropriate self-directed learning programs are critical for improving problem-solving ability affected by critical thinking among student nurses engaged in online education.

STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						Critical thinking; self-regulation in test-taking; performance task; test-taking effort; test-taking time; performance-based assessment	UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS; SKILLS; VALIDITY; COMPETENCE	Critical thinking is a multifaceted construct involving a set of skills and affective dispositions together with self-regulation. The aim of this study was to explore how self-regulation and effort in test-taking contribute to undergraduate students' performance in critical thinking assessment. The data were collected in 18 higher education institutions in Finland. A total of 2402 undergraduate students at the initial and final stages of their bachelor degree programmes participated in the study. An open-ended performance task, namely the Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA+) International, was assigned to assess students' critical thinking, and a self-report questionnaire was used to measure self-regulation and effort in test-taking. Information on test-taking time was also utilised in the analysis. The interrelations between the variables were analysed with correlations and structural equation models. The results indicate that self-regulation in test-taking has only indirect effects on critical thinking performance task scores, with effort and time as mediating variables. More precisely, planning contributed to critical thinking performance indirectly through test-taking time and effort, while monitoring had no significant relation to critical thinking performance. The findings did not differ between the initial-stage and final-stage students. The model explained a total of 36% of the variation in the critical thinking performance task scores for the initial-stage students and 27% for the final-stage students. The findings indicate that performance-based assessments should be carefully designed and implemented to better capture the multifaceted nature of critical thinking.

J	Wang, PL; Soergel, D				Wang, PL; Soergel, D			A cognitive model of document use during a research project. Study I. Document selection	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article							INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; DECISION-MAKING; VERBAL PROTOCOL; RELEVANCE; BEHAVIOR; MOTIVATIONS; DEFINITION; SCIENCE	This article proposes a model of document selection by real users of a bibliographic retrieval system. It reports on Part 1 of a longitudinal study of decision making on document use by academics during an actual research project. (Part 2 followed up the same users on how the selected documents were actually used in subsequent stages.) The participants are 25 self-selected faculty and graduate students in Agricultural Economics. After a reference interview, the researcher conducted a search of DIALOG databases and prepared a printout. The users selected documents from this printout; they were asked to read and think aloud while selecting documents. Their verbal reports were recorded and analyzed from a utility-theoretic perspective. The following model of the decision-making in the selection process emerged: document information elements (DIEs) in document records provide the information for judging documents on 11 criteria (including topicality, orientation, quality, novelty, and authority); the criteria judgments are combined in an assessment of document value along five dimensions (epistemic, functional, conditional, social, and emotional values), leading to the use decision. This model accounts for the use of personal knowledge and decision strategies applied in the selection process. The model has implications for the design of an intelligent document selection assistant.

One critical way for older adults to minimize the negative impact of COVID-19 and future pandemics is to stay informed about its latest information, which has been increasingly presented through online interactive visualizations (e.g., live dashboards and websites). Thus, it is imperative to understand how older adults interact with and comprehend online COVID-19 interactive visualizations and what challenges they might encounter to make such visualizations more accessible to older adults. We adopted a user-centered approach by inviting older adults to interact with COVID-19 interactive visualizations while at the same time verbalizing their thought processes using a think-aloud protocol. By analyzing their think-aloud verbalizations, we identified four types of thought processes representing how older adults comprehended the visualizations and uncovered the challenges they encountered with these thought processes. Furthermore, we also identified the challenges they encountered with seven common types of interaction techniques adopted by the visualizations. Based on the findings, we present design guidelines for making interactive visualizations more accessible to older adults.

Using a unique national survey of 2015 U.S. adults from October 2020, we investigate the relationship between this predisposition-conspiracy thinking-and 34 different psychological, political, and social correlates. Using conditional inference tree modeling-a machine learning-based approach designed to facilitate prediction using a flexible modeling methodology-we identify the characteristics that are most useful for orienting individuals along the conspiracy thinking continuum, including (but not limited to): anomie, Manicheanism, support for political violence, a tendency to share false information online, populism, narcissism, and psychopathy. Altogether, psychological characteristics are much more useful in predicting conspiracy thinking than are political and social characteristics, though even our robust set of correlates only partially accounts for variance in conspiracy thinking.

Implications about designing CT courses for pre-service teachers are discussed. Background: CT is an essential 21st-century competency that supports the development of problem-solving skills. Inspired by computing science problem-solving practices, CT should transcend disciplines, but few universities or colleges include CT courses or CT content in their core courses. It is also difficult to know what pre-service teachers think about CT and their role in promoting it. Research Questions: Do pre-service teachers' coding reflections reveal any important information about their knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward CT? Methodology: Traditional qualitative techniques based on human raters are impractical in analyzing hundreds of essays. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning modeling technique, was employed to extract topical features from participants' reflections. In one section of an undergraduate Introduction to Educational Technology course offered at a large university in Western Canada, n=139 pre-service teachers wrote a short reflection on their experience following a 20 h Accelerated Intro to Computer Science Code.org course. Topics were identified by analyzing contextual trends in participants' written reflections. Findings: Results showed that pre-service teachers' reflections included CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. Specifically, participants connected the coding activity to prior knowledge and experiences.

For certain Fourier regression models lattices are optimal as experimental designs because they produce orthogonal information matrices. When the Fourier model is restricted, that is a special subset of the full factorial (cross-spectral) model is used, there is a difficult inversion problem to find generators for an optimal design for the given model. Asymptotic results are derived for certain models as the dimension of the space goes to infinity. These can be thought of as a complexity theory connecting designs and models or as special type of Nyquist sampling theory. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Ten male elite-level junior cricket batsmen took part in the study. A repeated measures design was implemented, with participants verbalizing while both in (a) a threat state and (b) a challenge state. Participants were required to score 36 runs in 30 balls during the threat and challenge conditions. Verbalizations were subsequently transcribed verbatim and analyzed for stressors, coping strategies, and any other reoccurring themes. A paired-samples t-test was conducted to examine differences in the number of verbalizations made for each theme between conditions. Ten secondary themes were grouped into four primary themes; these included (a) stressors, (b) problem-focused coping, (c) emotion-focused coping, and (d) gathering information. There were significant differences( p <= 0.05) between stressor verbalizations, with significantly more verbalizations made by participants during a threat state. No significant differences were found between any other themes. Thus, during a threat state, participants reported significantly more stressor verbalizations compared to a challenge state, while there were no significant differences in coping strategies reported (p>0.05). This finding offers a potential explanation for why athletic performance diminishes when in a threat state, as athletes then experience a greater number of stressors but do not report engaging in more coping strategies.

NWFAR draws on intersectional feminist DS to scaffold critical perspectives towards systems of power and oppression and attend to students' experiences in designs for learning. NWFAR adds three practices that are typically not emphasized in learning designs for DS: feel- engaging emotions and the physical body; act-challenging, inspiring, or informing others towards change; and reimagine-envisioning how data, data methods, and data technologies could pursue different problems, solutions, and perspectives. We illustrate NWFAR through two design-based research projects from prior empirical work. Through these two examples, we demonstrate what thinking with NWFAR could look like in practice and highlight future possibilities for learning. We conclude with a discussion that focuses on the reimagining dimension, in which we highlight social justice oriented theories.

J	Beynon-Davies, P				Beynon-Davies, Paul			Characterizing Business Models for Digital Business Through Patterns	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE			English	Article						Business model; business motivation; business pattern; design science; digital business; online groceries; pattern comic	DESIGN SCIENCE RESEARCH; ORGANIZATIONAL ROUTINES; INFORMATION; FRAMEWORK; MANAGEMENT; THINKING; FUTURE; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION	This article considers business models through the lenses of both design science and the design orientation in management. It describes a new way of thinking about and engaging with business models as patterns. The term business pattern is used to refer to a coherent and repeating sequence of action involving humans, machines (including information technologies systems) and artifacts (such as data structures) as a way of organizing a firm. The study also describes a way of visualizing either existing business patterns or envisaged business patterns through the design artifact of a pattern comic. This is used to provide a narrative of some business pattern in principle or in practice. The design theory of a business pattern as well as the design artifact of a pattern comic offer a range of contributions to the literature on business models. First, they permit a clearer distinction to be drawn between business model, business motivation, and business strategy. Second, they suggest a clearer way of building models of business (organizing) either as currently conceived (as-is) or in terms of envisaged models (as-if). This also allows clearer expression of business motivation in terms of transitions between as-is and as-if business patterns. Third, business patterns offer a practical way of thinking about the reuse of business models as patterns and their potential for benchmarking purposes. To help ground both the theorization and the visualization proposed we apply the design theory of a business pattern and the design artifact of pattern comics to help make sense of the domain of online grocery.

The learning practices for mobile-assisted seamless science learning questionnaire was developed with three scales that denote learning supported by mobile technology. These scales included authentic learning, self-directed learning, and collaborative learning with information and communication technology. Associated self-efficacies promoted by mobile-assisted seamless science learning could include authentic problem-solving, creative thinking and academic self-efficacy. A sample of 312 primary school students from China responded to the mobile-assisted seamless science learning questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the mobile-assisted seamless science learning questionnaire had high reliability and validity. The path analysis results analysed via a structural equation modelling technique implied that primary school students' perceived self-directed learning and authentic learning were important as positive predictors for authentic problem-solving efficacy, which may function as a partial mediation variable in the effect of students' perceptions of learning practices on the academic self-efficacy of mobile-assisted seamless science learning. The findings highlighted that learning practices (i.e. authentic learning and self-directed learning) and authentic problem-solving efficacy are both indispensable and mutually reinforcing. This can provide some insights for promoting mobile learning in science learning in the future.

Redesigning printed educational materials for primary care physicians: design improvements increase usability	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Primary care; Educational materials; Usability; Design	POINTS-OF-VIEW; USER-CENTERED DESIGN; THINKING ALOUD; IMPLEMENTATION; INFORMATICS	Background: Printed educational materials (PEMs) are a frequently used tool to disseminate clinical information and attempt to change behavior within primary care. However, their effect on clinician behavior is limited. In this study, we explored how PEMs can be redesigned to better meet the needs of primary care physicians (PCPs) and whether usability and selection can be increased when design principles and user preferences are used. Methods: We redesigned a publicly available PEM using physician preferences, design principles, and graphic designer support. We invited PCPs to select their preferred document between the redesigned and original versions in a discrete choice experiment, followed by an assessment of usability with the System Usability Scale and a think aloud process. We conducted this study in both a controlled and opportunistic setting to determine whether usability testing results vary by study location. Think aloud data was thematically analyzed, and results were interpreted using the Technology Acceptance Model. Results: One hundred and eighty four PCPs participated in the discrete choice experiment at the 2014 Family Medicine Forum, a large Canadian conference for family physicians. Of these, 87.7 % preferred the redesigned version. Follow-up interviews were held with a randomly selected group of seven participants. We repeated this in a controlled setting in Toronto, Canada, with a set of 14 participants. Using the System Usability Scale, we found that usability scores were significantly increased with the redesign (p < 0.001). We also found that when PCPs were given the choice between the two versions, they selected the redesigned version as their preferred PEM more often than the original (p < 0.001). Results did not appear to differ between the opportunistic and controlled setting. We used the results of the think aloud process to add to a list of end user preferences developed in a previous study. Conclusions: We found that redesigning a PEM with user preferences and design principles can improve its usability and result in the PEM being selected more often than the original. We feel this finding supports the involvement of the user, application of design principles, and the assistance of a graphic designer in the development of PEMs.	[Grudniewicz, Agnes] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Bhattacharyya, Onil] Univ Toronto, Womens Coll Hosp, Toronto, ON M5S 1B3, Canada; [McKibbon, K.

Data-Structures for Multisensory Information Processing in an Embodied Machine-Mind	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Autonomous mental development; data-structures; embodied cognition; generally intelligent man-machine systems; multimodal information processing; self-conscious systems; thinking machines	BRAIN; REPRESENTATION; INTEGRATION; ATTENTION; EPIGENETICS; KNOWLEDGE; COGNITION; MEMORIES; SYSTEMS; MODEL	The real-world is a medley of multisensory information and so are our experiences, memories, and responses. As embodied beings, we respond to the information endogenously and in ways derived from self-defining factors. Thus inspired, we attempt formalization of data-structures to facilitate generation of system-bespoke comprehension-granules of the real-world. The conceptualized structures encapsulate multisensory inputs (sourced from the real-world or memories), intrinsic and deliberate emotions, messages (bearing intermittent process-results, queries, multimodal data, etc.) across system modules and memory units, and sensorimotor responses to the inputs. The structural-schematics are anthropomorphic. These variable-length constructs are theoretically platform-independent, support genericity across data-modality and information-inclusion, and provide for representation of novel sensory-data. An epigenome-styled header node for the afferent data-units provides for the activation of intuitive "fight-flight" behavior. The documentation includes a flow-graph, depicting the translation of information across the data-structures and the different ways of thinking while interpreting a real-world scene or a mind-generated event. Applicability of the structures has been analyzed in the context of comprehension in an embodied mind-machine framework and other similar architectures. Studies herein target contribution to the design of generally intelligent man-machine symbiotic systems.

Implementation Science Strategies Promote Fidelity in the Food, Feeding, and Your Family Study	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION EDUCATION AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						EFNEP; fidelity; peer educators; parental feeding; implementation science	RETENTION STRATEGIES; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; PROGRAM; HEALTH; CURRICULUM; CHILDREN	Objective: Use of implementation science strategies to promote fidelity in the Food, Feeding, and Your Family study. Design: Cluster randomized controlled trial with 3 conditions: control, in-class, or online, delivered in English or Spanish. Observations of 20% of classes. Setting: Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) in 2 states. Participants: EFNEP peer educators (n = 11). Intervention: Parental feeding content incorporated into EFNEP lessons (in-class) or through text with links to videos/activities (online). Extensive educator training, scripted curriculum, frequent feedback. Analysis: Assessment of fidelity compliance. Qualitative analysis of verbatim educator interviews and classroom observer comments. Results: During 128 class observations (40-45 per condition), peer educators followed scripted lesson plan 78% to 89% of the time. There was no evidence of cross-contamination of parental feeding content in control and only minor sharing in online conditions. Variations with fidelity were primarily tied to the EFNEP curriculum, not the parent feeding content. Educators (n = 7) expressed favorable opinions about the Food, Feeding, and Your Family study, thought it provided valuable information, and appreciated support from EFNEP leadership. Conclusions and Implications: Incorporating implementation science strategies can help ensure successful adherence to research protocols. With proper training and support, EFNEP peer educators can deliver an evidence-based curriculum as part of a complex research study.	[Aragon, M.

J	Jia, FY; Xiang, PC; Chen, D				Jia, Fuyuan; Xiang, Pengcheng; Chen, Dan			Prioritizing the Operation and Maintenance Complexity of Mega Transportation Projects Based on Systems Thinking	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Mega transportation projects (MTP); Operation and maintenance (O&M) complexity; Complexity prioritization and management; Systems thinking; Social network analysis (SNA)	ENGINEERING PROJECTS; NETWORK; FRAMEWORK; INFRASTRUCTURE; PERFORMANCE; IMPACTS	Complexity creates both challenges and opportunities for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of mega transportation projects (MTPs), making it imperative to explore the O&M complexity. Traditional approaches to the analysis of project complexity followed reductionist thinking and failed to address the relationships between system elements. Therefore, this study proposes a systems thinking-based framework that captures the relationships to prioritize the O&M complexity of MTPs using social network analysis (SNA). First, 47 complexity indicators were identified through a literature review, semistructured interviews, and a Delphi survey. These indicators were applied to map the O&M complexity network of the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, with the structural characteristics analyzed using SNA. The results reveal that the availability of technologies, skills, methods, and tools is most closely related to other indicators and that the sharing level of operational information most strongly controls other indicators. Furthermore, the management strategies for this case were formulated according to the centrality of network nodes, and a complexity management process that can be applied to prioritize and manage the O&M complexity of any MTP was designed.

This study disentangles the impacts of third-person perspectives (offered by traditional simulations) and first-person perspectives (offered by participatory simulations) on children's development of such systems thinking in the context of the emergent complexity of honeybee nectar foraging. Specifically, we worked with three first-grade classrooms assigned to one of three conditions-instruction through use of a first-person perspective only, third-person perspective only, and integrated instruction-to engage ideas of complex systems thinking. In each condition, systems concepts were targeted through instruction and assessment. The integrated and third-person classrooms demonstrated significant gains while the first-person classroom showed gains that were not statistically significant, suggesting that third-person perspectives play a critical role in how children learn systems thinking. This work also puts forth a novel assessment design for young children using multiple-choice questions.

J	Huang, C				Huang, C			Designing high-quality interactive multimedia learning modules	COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS			English	Article						educational media; interactive teaching for biology and medicine; instructional web design; physiology modules; multimedia module design		Modem research has broadened scientific knowledge and revealed the interdisciplinary nature of the sciences. For today's students, this advance translates to teaming a more diverse range of concepts, usually in less time, and without supporting resources. Students can benefit from technology-enhanced learning supplements that unify concepts and are delivered on-demand over the Internet. Such supplements, like imaging informatics databases, serve as innovative references for biomedical information, but could improve their interaction interfaces to support teaming. With information from these digital datasets, multimedia teaming tools can be designed to transform teaming into an active process where students can visualize relationships over time, interact with dynamic content, and immediately test their knowledge. This approach bridges knowledge gaps, fosters conceptual understanding, and builds problem-solving and critical thinking skills-all essential components to informatics training for science and medicine. Additional benefits include cost-free access and ease of dissemination over the Intemet or CD-ROM. However, current methods for the design of multimedia learning modules are not standardized and lack strong instructional design. Pressure from administrators at the top and students from the bottom are pushing faculty to use modern technology to address the teaming needs and expectations of contemporary students. Yet, faculty lack adequate support and training to adopt this new approach. So how can faculty learn to create educational multimedia materials for their students? This paper provides guidelines on best practices in educational multimedia design, derived from the Virtual Labs Project at Stanford University. The development of a multimedia module consists of five phases: (1) understand the teaming problem and the users needs; (2) design the content to harness the enabling technologies; (3) build multimedia materials with web style standards and human factors principles; (4) user testing; (5) Evaluate and improve design.

The process of generating concepts that meet customer requirements, however, can be challenging due to incomplete information, chaotic design constraints, and complicated design iterations. Deep learning-based pretrained language models can be a potential solution to overcome these limitations. But current methods are limited by the gap between the language used in design-related documents such as patent and the casual spoken language as the latter reflects the thinking process of concept generation. In this paper, we propose a key concepts derivation approach based on cognitive analysis to address challenges in product design and to effectively incorporate prior knowledge. This approach leverages a pretrained language model to extract information from multiple sources of textual data and represents design thinking in a vector space. We conduct a Design-by-Analogy based verbal protocol analysis experiment for high-speed elevators to collect verbal data and establish a design thinking corpus. Based on this, our approach is employed for key concepts derivation in product design and explore how solutions are generated to realize specific customer-required functionality. By analyzing the types of design stimuli, the effectiveness of our approach in deriving key design concepts are demonstrated with respect to novelty and feasibility.

However, websites or catalogs do not provide reliable information, easy search, and intuitive access to these apps, causing access information difficulties. Therefore, this work proposes to develop a digital catalog of software focused on motor disability. This work performed a systematic search of websites and catalogs related to motor disability, a systematic search of the apps that the digital catalog would show, and a quality evaluation of selected apps using the Mobile Application Rating Scale tool. The digital catalog was developed with the information obtained in the previous phases combining the Prototyping and User Experience criteria, then assessed by final users, software testers, and a web accessibility evaluation tool. The catalog obtained a satisfactory quality score based on the end-users' and therapists' satisfaction when finding technological resources to use in their professional and health-care activities. This research aims to contribute to those interested in developing software for people with disabilities and encouraging them to create and design their implementations based on this study.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and aspirin use and the risk of head and neck cancer: a systematic review	CANCER CAUSES & CONTROL			English	Review						Head and neck cancer; Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs; Aspirin; Systematic review; COX-2	SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA; ORAL PREMALIGNANT LESIONS; UPPER AERODIGESTIVE TRACT; COLORECTAL-CANCER; CYCLOOXYGENASE-2 EXPRESSION; INHIBITION; CELECOXIB; COHORT; PREVENTION; MORTALITY	Background Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been associated with a reduced risk of several cancers. This is thought to be through the inhibitory action on the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, COX-2. Evidence for NSAIDs preventing head and neck cancer (HNC) is conflicting. We conducted a systematic literature review to investigate the association between NSAID/aspirin use and risk of head and neck cancer (HNC). Methodology MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were systematically searched using terms for NSAIDs/aspirin, HNC, and observational/intervention study designs to identify studies published by December 2009. Results Of 9,268 articles identified, two population-based prescribing database studies and three case-control studies met the selection criteria. The studies investigated different HNC sites. Only one study found a significant protective association of aspirin use with HNC risk (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96), and one showed a significantly increased risk of oral/oropharyngeal cancer with non-low-dose aspirin NSAID use (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.8-6.7). Many of the studies identified lacked information on important confounding factors. Conclusion No definitive conclusion on the effect of NSAIDs/aspirin on HNC risk was possible. Aspirin may protect against HNC, although further robust large-scale studies are required to clarify any possible association.

J	Gürgil, F; Çetin, T				Gurgil, Fitnat; Cetin, Turhan			A Study on the Efficacy of the Integrated Program Design on Teaching the Theme of "Science and Technology"	EGITIM VE BILIM-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE			English	Article						Integrated curriculum; Interdisciplinary program; Thematic learning; Social studies; Science; Turkish language; Visual arts; Folk culture; Middle school	CURRICULUM INTEGRATION	This study was made in order to determine the impact of the education, based on the integrated curriculum that was developed for the theme of "Science and Technology", on the academic success of the students and the views of the students and teachers, participating in the study, on the integrated curriculum. In this study, based on associating five different lessons, it was examined whether information that is learned in different lessons can be transferred, or not. The study was performed at a middle school, at a middle-class socioeconomic level in the province of Ankara, in the academic year of 2014-2015. In this study, in which the quantitative and qualitative research methods were used together, the mixed method was adopted. In the quantitative aspect of the study, the experimental pattern, with pretest-posttest control groups, was used. In the study, the social studies, Turkish language, sciences, visual arts and elective folk culture lessons were studied with the experimental group students by being associated with each other. And in the control group, the existing lessons were studied according to teachers' routine lesson plans with a disciplinary concept. As the academic success test was used in the quantitative aspect of the study, the semi-structured interviews were made with the students and the teachers who conducted the lessons of the experimental group, in the qualitative aspect. Furthermore, the students' study documents, researcher field notes and observations were benefited from as the qualitative data collection instruments. For the analysis of the quantitative sub-problems of the study, SPSS 17.0 package program was used. In the analysis of the quantitative data, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used; and content analysis in the analysis of the qualitative data. According to the analysis of the obtained data, it was determined that the lessons, performed with the integrated curriculum, were more effective than the existing one, in terms of academic success. As the result of the interviews that were made with the students, it was found that the students liked the lessons, studied with the integrated curriculum model, more. Together with this, it was concluded that the integrated curriculum -based education was more effective with regard to the teaching of the complex subjects. It was also found in the study that the students transferred information that they learned in a lesson to another lesson. It is thought that this study will give an idea to both researchers and teachers, who are the appliers of the lessons, at the point of associating and applying different lessons, based on the integrated curriculum in particular.

In addition, the study aims to examine the mediation effect of creativity between knowledge sharing, systems thinking and organizational sustainability. Design/methodology/approach A survey method based on a questionnaire was used to gather data from 407 middle managers in the hotel industry in Malaysia. The partial least squares technique was used to examine the hypotheses. Findings The study found support for the effects of systems thinking and knowledge sharing on organizational sustainability. It also found support for the impact of creativity on organizational sustainability. Besides, the mediating role of creativity between systems thinking and organizational sustainability, and between knowledge sharing and organizational sustainability was also supported by data. Originality/value This is a pioneer work that has combined various human resources (i.e. systems thinking, knowledge sharing, creativity) to examine their impacts on organizational sustainability. Moreover, this work has established comparatively new relationships, i.e. the impact of systems thinking and knowledge sharing on creativity and organizational sustainability. In addition, the mediation role of creativity between systems thinking, knowledge sharing and organizational sustainability is relatively new in the literature. Furthermore, this study has confirmed the validity and reliability of knowledge sharing and organizational sustainability at first and second orders in the hotel industry in non-Western context.

Dependence on wood fuel characterises most Sub-Saharan countries and WES are complex socio-ecological systems dynamically linked to crucial development issues, e.g., deforestation and poverty. In Mozambique WES supply over 70% of the national energy needs through an informal business network worth around one million euros each year. In contrast with the 2MBio, currently available tools often aim at supporting decision making on WES with off-the-shelf expert solutions and optimisation of WES efficiency, supply chains and resource management. While relevant and useful, such approaches are frequently unsuitable to engage the knowledge and creativity of a wide range of crucial actors. The 2MBio addresses this gap providing a simple, visual platform on paper that supports from illiterate to professional users, to stimulate creative ideas and apply current knowledge while designing their own WES. The results of implementation in real settings in South Mozambique produced relevant design breakthroughs. Compared with the absence of any other support tool, and faced with same design challenges, the 2MBio participatory design workshops in south Mozambique resulted in comprehensive analysis of wood fuel energy systems, and innovative integrated WES solutions design. The proposed approach raised participants' awareness about opportunities and constrains linked to their WES while also facilitating information sharing new learning dynamics and enhance creativity.

J	Hwang, GJ; Yang, CL; Chou, KR; Chang, CY				Hwang, Gwo-Jen; Yang, Chin-Lan; Chou, Kuei-Ru; Chang, Ching-Yi			An MDRE approach to promoting students' learning performances in the era of the pandemic: A quasi-experimental design	BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						critical thinking; decision making; mobile applications; mobile learning	CRITICAL THINKING; VOCATIONAL-EDUCATION; DECISION-MAKING; MOBILE; CONNECTIVISM; REALITY; SYSTEM; NURSES	Educators have indicated the need to foster students' ability to solve problems by acquiring up-to-date knowledge as well as promoting their competences for making decisions from diverse perspectives based on the acquired knowledge. Traditional courses mainly use lecture-based instruction without providing sufficient opportunities for students to practice and interact with the teacher; therefore, it is difficult to deliver such up-to-date knowledge via traditional instruction, not to mention fostering students' critical thinking. In this study, the Mobile technology-supported Decision, Reflection and Exercise (MDRE) model is proposed to address this problem. Moreover, a learning system is developed based on the proposed approach. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a quasi-experiment was conducted in a university with a two-group pretest posttest design to assess participants' learning achievement, critical thinking and learning satisfaction. The participants were two classes of undergraduate students. One class with 37 students was the experimental group learning with the MDRE learning approach, whereas the other class with 37 students was the control group learning with the conventional technology-based learning approach. Analysis of covariance was performed to evaluate the effect of the intervention on the target outcomes. It was found that the experimental group showed better learning achievement, critical thinking and learning satisfaction than the control group. This implies that the MDRE approach has good potential in helping learners think from diverse perspectives and promoting their learning performance and engagement, which is important in higher education aimed at fostering students' competence of acquiring up-to-date knowledge for solving problems. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Fostering students' problem-solving competence is an important educational objective.The advancement of mobile and wireless communication technologies provides opportunities for students to acquire up-to-date information for solving problems.In the conventional technology-enhanced professional learning mode, instructors generally use computers to present learning content and exemplary cases. In such a learning mode, learners have few opportunities to think in depth.What this paper adds A Mobile technology-supported Decision, Reflection and Exercise (MDRE) approach is proposed to guide students to make decisions and think from diverse perspectives via acquiring up-to-date information using a mobile application.An experiment was conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.The experimental results showed that the MDRE approach is able to boost students' creative thinking tendency and learning satisfaction as well as promoting their learning achievement.Implications for practice and/or policy The MDRE approach has great potential for professional training aiming to foster students' learning achievement, critical thinking and learning satisfaction.It is suggested that researchers and school teachers can apply the MDRE approach to other professional courses, such as nursing training programs and business planning courses.

Responding to personalised social norms feedback from a web-based alcohol reduction intervention for students: Analysis of think-aloudverbal protocols	PSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH			English	Article						e-intervention; personalised feedback; student; alcohol; think-aloud; e-health	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; COLLEGE-STUDENT; DRINKING PREVENTION; CONSUMPTION	Objectives: Web-based interventions enable organisations to deliver personalised individually tailored brief feedback to individuals without the need of a third party. Web-based interventions are effective in reducing alcohol consumption among university students. There is a paucity of evidence to indicate those who access web-based personalised feedback interventions respond in a way consistent with hypothesised active ingredients. This research uses the think-aloud technique to explore how students respond to instant web-based personalised normative feedback.Methods: Between-subjects experimental design employing qualitative methods. Twenty-one UK university students generated think-aloud transcripts while completing a web-based intervention (Unitcheck). This was followed by a semi-structured interview. One coding frame was developed to classify all utterances.Results: Narrative synthesis revealed five meta-themes: active thinking about alcohol use; comparisons with others; beliefs and knowledge about alcohol consumption; inter-relationship between personal codes and context; and engagement with Unitcheck.Conclusions: Students willingly engaged with the online assessment and personalised feedback. Students consciously engaged with the intervention and this engagement prompted students to actively consider their own behaviour, knowledge, perceptions, and to reflect on future behaviour. The ability of web-based personalised feedback interventions to effect change in individual's behaviours is likely related to their ability to encourage cognitive engagement and active processing of the information provided.

J	Wan, ZH; So, WMW; Zhan, Y				Wan, Zhi Hong; So, Wing Mui Winnie; Zhan, Ying			Investigating the Effects of Design-Based STEM Learning on Primary Students' STEM Creativity and Epistemic Beliefs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION			English	Article						Creativity; Design; Epistemic beliefs; Information technology; STEM	ELEMENTARY SCIENCE; CRITICAL THINKING; ROBOTICS; ABILITY; ENVIRONMENT; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; CONTEXT; MODEL	Integrated STEM education has been the focus of recent curriculum reforms worldwide. Learning through design is a distinctive and significant approach to achieving STEM integration. Although studies have investigated various outcomes of design-based STEM learning, little has been done to examine its influence on two significant learning outcomes-STEM creativity and epistemic beliefs, especially in the context of primary education. In this study, we investigated the effects of a 6-month design-based STEM learning event (in which the application of information technologies was required) on 155 upper primary students' STEM creativity and epistemic beliefs. The results showed (i) a significant improvement in the fluency and flexibility dimensions of STEM creativity, (ii) a significant decrease in the source, certainty, and justification dimensions of epistemic beliefs, and (iii) no statistically significant change in the originality dimension of STEM creativity or the complexity dimension of epistemic beliefs. Moreover, we found significant and negative correlations between STEM creativity and the source, certainty, and justification dimensions of epistemic beliefs, but a significant and positive correlation between STEM creativity and the complexity dimension of epistemic beliefs. The findings of this study generate additional evidence to support design-based learning as a meaningful and feasible approach to achieving STEM integration in primary schools. Suggestions are made on how to design and implement integrated STEM education in primary schools.

To search quickly and effectively the CAD assembly models related with product design requirements information for assembly model reuse, inspire designers' design thought and product design innovation in the product conceptual design phase, a novel approach for CAD assembly model clustering and retrieval based on multi-source attributes information is proposed. First, the CAD assembly model is represented by attribute adjacency graph (AAG) with multiple attributes information, and the similarity between assembly models is evaluated comprehensively by considering part information and assembly relationship information. Then, a weighted graph is constructed for assembly clustering in model repository. Meanwhile, an improved spectral clustering algorithm is given to divide CAD assembly models into different assembly dusters. Subsequently, indexing model is established for each assembly cluster. After that, the process of assembly retrieval based on indexing model mechanism is given in detail. Finally, experiments on the prototype system verify effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach for assembly clustering and retrieval.

This study aimed to explore the effects of sociodemographic and health information, symptom distress, self-efficacy, and positive thinking on the health-related QOL (general QOL and urinary incontinence-specific QOL) of women with SUI. Methods A cross-sectional study design was used. Women with SUI were recruited from the obstetrics and gynecology outpatient department and urodynamics examination room of a hospital by convenience sampling from August 2021 to March 2022. Participants were surveyed on the following questionnaires: Urogenital Distress Inventory, Geriatric Self-efficacy Index for Urinary Incontinence, Positive Thinking Scale, 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form. Results Participants (N = 135) had a mean age of 53.76 years old. The mean SF-12 physical component summary score was 48.48 (physical QOL), and the mental component summary score was 46.56 (mental QOL). The urinary incontinence-specific QOL score was 16.01. Women with greater positive thinking and higher self-efficacy for urinary incontinence had better physical and mental QOL. Women with less symptom distress of urinary incontinence and higher self-efficacy for urinary incontinence had better urinary incontinence-specific QOL. Conclusion The health-related QOL of women with SUI is affected by many factors, including positive thinking, self-efficacy, and symptom distress. Healthcare professionals can provide multifaceted programs to improve the health-related QOL of women with SUI.

J	Leahy, K; Phelan, P				Leahy, Keelin; Phelan, Pat			A review of Technology Education in Ireland; a changing technological environment promoting design activity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN EDUCATION			English	Article						Technology Education; Second level education; Design activity; Technological environment		In Ireland, Technology Education's structure and organisation across the levels of education is not delivered or governed in a coherent manner. Technology Education in primary level education, for students between 5 and 12 years of age, does not explicitly exist as a separate subject. In primary level education, Social, Environmental and Scientific Education (Science), encourages a child to examine and appreciate how technology and science impacts on their lives and the environment. It supports children developing design and make skills, and to apply scientific ideas to everyday situations and practical problems (DES in Primary school curriculum, science. Social, environmental and scientific education curriculum, 1999). In addition, various initiatives such as the Junior Lego League, supported by the Galway Education Centre, facilitate various perspectives of Technology Education. In second level education, which this paper primarily focuses on, Technology Education exists as a suite of eight subjects, for students of 12-18 years of age. In third level education students can choose from a wide range of bachelor degree programmes in science, technology, engineering or maths. The degree programmes available at third level also include programmes in initial teacher education (ITE). These programmes in initial teacher education are offered by two institutions, and graduate second level teachers to service the second level system. Technology Education in second level education was first introduced to Ireland in 1885. Since this introduction, revisions and changes have occurred, in both the Irish economy and syllabi. In 2006, Technology Education syllabi were revised to include more design activity at senior cycle. These changes reflect the forward thinking of policy makers in reflection of the progression from the industrial era to the information era to the conceptual era. The scope of second level Technology Education in an Irish context is still perceived by many as vocational, though progressive reformations are advancing towards a design-driven framework, grounded in a strong craft practice. This changing technological environment has resulted in the promotion of design activity in second level Technology Education in Ireland. This paper reviews the establishment of design education in Technology Education in the Irish second level education context, where an epistemological shift towards design activity has occurred.

While participatory design has been applied to some affective technologies, the technical and algorithmic complexity of those based on semi-intelligent information filters (SIIFs) pose distinct challenges. Coincidentally, these technologies raise important and distinct ethical issues that make stakeholder input critical during product design. We present a framework for fostering genuine engagement from stakeholders through the case example of biomusic - a SIIF-based affective technology that translates emotion-related physiological changes into sound. During a 3-day workshop, ethnographic methods were used to collect data about the interface between biomusic and individuals on the autism spectrum. From these data, emergent themes, such as such as privacy, data security, conceptions of assistive technology and representation of emotions were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. In order to illuminate distinct design decisions implicated by these complex and interwoven ethical issues, we propose a design framework consisting of a technological, a human-centered and an ecological lens. This framework and recommendations provide a concrete praxis for engaging stakeholders in the complex issues associated with the design of SIIF-based emotion-oriented systems.

Neuroimaging studies have shown that the frontopolar cortex (Brodmann area [BA] 10) is involved in thinking about the future and demonstrated that patients with MDD have dysfunctions in BA10. However, the relationship between pessimistic thinking about the future and brain activity is unclear. Hence, we aimed to compare brain activity during future-thinking between patients with MDD and healthy individuals. Methods: We assessed 23 patients with current MDD and 23 healthy individuals. Participants were instructed to imagine the future or to recall the past using the future-thinking paradigm with four distinct temporal conditions (distant future, near future, distant past, and near past) during functional MRI. Resting-state functional MRI was also performed to explore the functional connectivity of BA10. Results: Compared with healthy individuals, patients with MDD had greater negative thinking about the distant future and exhibited increased activation in the medial BA10 when imagining the distant future, following smallvolume correction focusing on the frontopolar a priori region of interest (family-wise error correctionp < 0.05). Increased positive functional correlation between the right BA10 seed region and the posterior cingulate cortex was also observed. Conclusion: Patients with MDD who show greater pessimistic thinking about the distant future demonstrate increased activation in the frontopolar cortex. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that frontopolar cortical dysfunction plays a key role in the hopelessness that manifests in patients with MDD.

Background Clinical reasoning is an essential element in nursing practice. Registered nurses' clinical reasoning process during the documentation of nursing care in electronic health records has received little attention in nursing literature. Further research is needed to understand registered nurses' clinical reasoning, especially for care planning and documentation of dementia care due to its complexity and a large amount of information collected. Design A qualitative explorative design was used with a concurrent think-aloud technique. Methods The transcribed verbalisations were analysed using protocol analysis with referring phrase, assertional and script analyses. Data were collected over ten months in 2019-2020 from 12 registered nurses in three nursing homes offering special dementia care. The COREQ checklist for qualitative studies was used. Results The nurses primarily focused on assessments and interventions during documentation. Most registered nurses used their experience and heuristics when reasoning about the residents' current health and well-being. They also used logical thinking or followed local practice rules when reasoning about planned or implemented interventions. Conclusion The registered nurses moved back and forth among all the elements in the nursing process. They used a variety of clinical reasoning attributes during care planning and nursing documentation. The most used clinical reasoning attributes were information processing, cognition and inference. The most focused information was planned and implemented interventions. Relevance to clinical practice Knowledge of the clinical reasoning process of registered nurses during care planning and documentation should be used in developing electronic health record systems that support the workflow of registered nurses and enhance their ability to disseminate relevant information.

Information Architects: Using Community-Engaged and Qualitative Methods to Design a Technology-Based Nutrition and Cancer Risk Intervention for Rural Adults	CANCER CONTROL			English	Article						telehealth; cognitive load; colorectal cancer prevention; website design; digital health interventions; rural health disparities; qualitative	COGNITIVE LOAD THEORY; INTENTION; OVERLOAD; COLON	BackgroundNearly half of all cancer deaths are preventable through modification or avoidance of key risk factors. As such, there is a growing urgency to identify effective, low-resource, and scalable technologies that support clinical care and patient self-management of health behaviors.PurposeInformed by theories of cognitive load and user-centered design approaches, we develop a culturally tailored, multicomponent digital intervention to engage rural adults between 50-73 years old with their personalized nutrition risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention.MethodA total of 48 adults tested a Virtual Health Assistant (VHA) prototype during focus groups in individual think-aloud interviews to facilitate iterative adaptations to a web-based CRC prevention intervention. Qualitative data was analyzed to identify user needs and preferences related to information and with a focus on avoiding cognitive overload.ResultsThe VHA serves as a conceptual pre-training for users helping them understand CRC prevention key concepts and engendering motivation to act on the promoted behavior. A website was identified as a strategy to fill information gaps and present actionable information, after the VHA interaction. Cognitive load reducing strategies were used including segmenting where information is presented in learner-controlled segments rather than continuously.ConclusionsFindings indicate potential benefits of designing CRC prevention information technologies with the rural older adults. Integrating patient-centered needs before launching health information web content will be important as the rapid growth of telemedicine aims to reach traditionally marginalized and underserved populations. Theoretically informed considerations for potential adverse outcomes (eg, information overload) are discussed.	[Vilaro, Melissa J.

J	Sutton, AF; Glenny, AM; McCord, JF				Sutton, AF; Glenny, AM; McCord, JF			Interventions for replacing missing teeth: denture chewing surface designs in edentulous people	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							OCCLUSION; SCHEMES	Background When constructing complete dentures for edentulous patients, ultimately patient satisfaction is key. Complete dentures can be produced with different types of occlusal schemes (chewing surfaces) and it is widely accepted that the occlusal scheme for complete dentures has a direct influence upon their success. Objectives To assess the relative effectiveness of differing occlusal schemes for complete dentures with regard to patient satisfaction. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in terms of patient satisfaction between different designs of chewing surfaces for complete dentures. Search strategy Several electronic databases were searched in order to identify relevant trials: Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to week 2 April 2004), OLDMEDLINE (1953 to 1965), EMBASE (1980 to week 16 2004), Zetoc (1993 to December 2003), SIGLE (1980 to December 2003), SCI (Science Citation Index) (1945 to 04 April 2004). Reference lists of identified, relevant trials and review articles were scanned. Unpublished data were sought through personal contact with experts in the field. There was no language restriction. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs), recruiting edentulous adults, and comparing complete dentures produced with different occlusal schemes with regard to patient satisfaction and masticatory function. Data collection and analysis The quality assessment of the included trials was undertaken independently and in duplicate by two reviewers based initially on what was written in the articles. Data were extracted by two reviewers independently. Disagreements were discussed and a third reviewer consulted as necessary. Authors were contacted for clarification or missing information. Data were excluded until further clarification if agreement could not be reached. Main results 1076 titles and abstracts were identified through the electronic searches. Thirteen trials were thought to be potentially relevant. Ten of these studies were subsequently excluded following further analysis. Two trials require further information from the author before being considered eligible for inclusion. Only one cross-over trial (n = 3 0), comparing lingualised teeth and zero-degree teeth, fully m et the review's inclusion criteria. Twenty patients preferred the lingualised denture, five the zero - degree denture and five patients had no preference. There was a statistically significant difference in favour of the lingualised denture with an odds ratio of 10(95% confidence interval 2.04 to 48.96). Authors' conclusions There is weak evidence that it may be advantageous, for dentists providing a complete denture service, to prescribe prosthetic posterior teeth with cusps to improve patient satisfaction compared to providing cuspless teeth. However, this conclusion may only be made tentatively until further well conducted trials comparing different occlusal schemes for complete dentures are undertaken.

DesignThe concept analysis method of Walker and Avant was used. MethodEight databases (PubMed, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, VIP Information Chinese Journal Service Platform, and Chinese BioMedicine Literature Database) were searched from inception to July 2022 for studies focused on psychological birth trauma. ResultsOf the 5,372 studies identified, 44 ultimately met the inclusion criteria. The attributes identified were (1) women's subjective feelings, (2) intertwined painful emotional experiences, (3) originating in the birth process, and (4) lasting until postpartum. Antecedents were divided into two groups: pre-existing antecedents and birth-related antecedents. Consequences were identified as negative and positive. ConclusionPsychological birth trauma is a more complex and comprehensive concept than previously thought, and should be regarded as a separate postpartum mental health problem. This study deepens the understanding of psychological birth trauma through a comprehensive concept analysis and also puts forward some suggestions for the prevention, identification, and intervention of psychological birth trauma, which provides a basis for assisting in the identification of psychological birth trauma and provides a reference for the development of rigorous assessment tools and the design of appropriate interventions in the future. Further research is needed to update and refine this concept.

Authentic Pathology Specimen Reception: A Valuable Resource for Developing Biomedical Science Student Competencies and Employability	BRITISH JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						biomedical science education; specimen reception simulation; authentic education; graduate capital; employability	EDUCATION	Background/Introduction: The pathology specimen reception is fundamental to the services provided by Biomedical Science laboratories worldwide. To ensure patient safety and that samples are of adequate quality to send for analysis, prospective Biomedical Scientists should have a robust knowledge of the processes involved and the acceptance criteria of the pathology specimen reception. This knowledge has been highlighted by employers as a current gap in Biomedical Science graduates and therefore needs to be addressed within higher education settings. To do this, this study aimed to 1) design a practical session to simulate the key processes of the pathology specimen reception and 2) to understand Biomedical Science students' opinions on these activities and the development of transferable skills required for post-graduate employment.Methods: The practical session was designed based on industrial requirements and academic knowledge of student skill sets to ensure suitability. Qualitative information regarding participant demographics and career interests was acquired through open-answer or multiple-choice questions. Quantitative student feedback was acquired via questionnaires utilising a 5-point Likert scale (n = 77).Results: The scenario-based practical session provided students with a positive learning experience with 98.7% of participants enjoying the session, with 87.0% stating they learned a lot by completing the session. It was also identified that participants preferred this style of learning to that of conventional higher education teaching modalities with 97.4% stating they would prefer simulated employment focussed scenarios embedded into the curriculum more often. The majority of participants also thought this session was helpful for the development of their key transferrable skills including teamworking, communication, and confidence. When stratified based on demographic data, there was minimal difference between cohorts and in the majority of cases, those participants from non-traditional university entry backgrounds had a more positive experience and better transferable skill development following the completion of this style of learning experience.Conclusion: This study highlights simulation-based learning as a tool to develop core Biomedical Science knowledge, build student graduate capital, and ensure the preparedness of students for post-graduation employment.

While patients are encouraged to manage it themselves, research findings indicate that GDM may negatively affect the foetus; in addition, there is an increased risk of women with GDM subsequently developing Type 2 diabetes. To alleviate the risks, women with GDM are advised to maintain a record of their diet and blood glucose levels and to attend regular clinical reviews. Rather than using a paper diary, women with GDM can maintain a record of their blood glucose level readings and other relevant data using a wellness mobile application (app). However, such apps are developed for general use and may not meet the specific needs of clinical staff (physicians, dietitians, obstetricians and midwives) involved in managing GDM; for example, an app may record glucose readings but not the details of a meal taken before or after the glucose reading. Second, the apps do not permanently store the data generated by the patient and do not support the transfer of these data to a clinical system or information portal. The mobile health (mHealth) system designed and developed in this research allows one to integrate different types of user generated wellness data into a centralised database. A user-centered design (UCD) approach informed by the technology acceptance model (TAM) was adopted. This paper investigates and evaluates the effectiveness of the approach with regard to facilitating system acceptance and future adoption through an early focus on enhancing system usefulness and ease of use. The functional system requirements of the proposed system were refined through a series of interviews with the perspective of clinical users; ease-of-use and usability issues were resolved through 'think aloud' sessions with clinicians and GDM patients.

Health IT applications, such as electronic health records or decision-support systems, are meant to support both professionals and their support systems. However, for physicians using these applications, the applications often cause new problems, such as the impracticality of their use in clinical practice. This review adopts a social sciences perspective to understand these problems and derive suggestions for further development. Indeed, humans use tools to remediate the brain's weaknesses and enhance thinking. Available health IT tools have been shaped to fit administrative needs rather than physicians' needs. To increase the beneficial effect of health IT applications in health care, clinicians' style of thinking and their learning needs must be considered when designing and implementing such systems. New health IT tools must be shaped to fit health professionals' needs.

SSbD is a broad approach that ensures that chemicals/advanced materials/products/services are produced and used in a way to avoid harm to humans and the environment. Technical and policy-related literature was surveyed for battery technologies and recommendations were provided for a broad SSbD approach that remains firmly grounded in Life Cycle Thinking principles. The approach integrates functional performance and sustainability (safety, social, environmental, and economic) aspects throughout the life cycle of materials, products, and processes, and evaluates how their interactions reflect on SSbD parameters. 22 different types of batteries were analyzed in a life cycle thinking approach for criticality, toxicity/safety, environmental and social impact, circularity, functionality, and cost to ensure battery innovation has a green and sustainable purpose to avoid unintended consequences.

J	Kambur, E; Yildirim, T				Kambur, Emine; Yildirim, Tulay			From traditional to smart human resources management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER			English	Article						New technology; Careers; Performance management; Human resource management	ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; TECHNOLOGY; INTERNET; IMPACT; HRM	Purpose The purpose of this article is to examine all the studies carried out within the scope of e-HRM and smart HRM, grouped according to the sub-functions of technical and HRM. The use of technology in HRM has started since the mid-1990s. However, this study focused on the articles published after 2014 in order to keep up to date. Any search strategy should allow for the completeness of the search to be evaluated. The terms "electronic-HRM", "AI and HRM", "Industry 4.0 and HRM", "Society 5.0 and HRM", "Human Resource Information Systems" and "Digital Technologies and HRM" "Human-robot interaction" has been questioned in IEEE Xplore, ALM digital library, Emerald Insight, SpringerLink, and Science Direct. The Web of Science and Scopus were also queried to double-check the findings and find other relevant articles in lesser-known libraries. Google Scholar was also used for forward and backward searches. These online databases have been chosen because they present the most important peer-reviewed full-text journals, conference proceedings, book chapters. Then, the references of each article were reviewed for additional articles on digital technologies and HRM. Each subsequent article is then reviewed for additional reference. Design/methodology/approach A total of 5,580 articles have been reviewed. Duplicate items have been removed. The titles and abstracts of 3,500 articles have been scanned to identify potential articles. The full-text evaluation of 2,554 was based on compliance with the inclusion criteria. In addition, 2,458 studies have been excluded. In total, 96 studies have been selected for data extraction. Additionally, questionnaires and reviews have been used to provide comprehensive research on e-HRM and smart HRM. The search terms used are expected to cover most, if not all, of the studies involving e-HRM and smart HRM. Findings The study carried out in this article is qualitative research. In the article, which methods are used and what has changed in e-HRM and smart HRM are examined. In particular, it has been thought about what can happen with the inclusion of human-machine interaction, AI, chatbots, industry 4.0 and information systems in HRM. Unlike previous studies, this review takes HRM from a broader perspective and groups it by topic, both by technical and HR functions. In addition, the reviewed articles provide brief information about the AI technologies used. In particular, criteria were taken into account according to the field, type and subject of the articles. Originality/value This study has the distinction of being the first in the literature in terms of examining all the studies carried out within the scope of e-HRM and smart HRM and grouped according to the sub-functions of technical and HRM in line with its purpose. The article focuses specifically on research published after 2014. It is expected to contribute to the literature in terms of collecting all studies in a single article. Other contributions of this article can be summarized in four main articles: 1) it presents a summary of previous research by grouping the studies on e-HRM and smart HRM according to the interests of researchers. 2) It saves time for the reader as it provides a brief explanation of the studies on the subject. 3) Instead of explaining in detail the general details analyzed in other articles, it offers a practical perspective by focusing on the type, subject and field of the article. 4) With the digitalization of HRM, new, up-to-date research and techniques are introduced.

Its main contribution is its more rigorous treatment/control group research design that allows testing for causal influences of CCEs on student learning and performance. Background: Computer science (CS) courses are critical foundational courses for engineering students. CCEs that merge computational and creative thinking have been shown to increase achievement and learning of engineering and nonengineering students in CS1 courses, but previous research has used quasi-and non-experimental designs. Intended Outcomes: CCEs are intended to improve students' learning of CS1 content and problem-solving ability by fostering computational creativity. Application Design: CCEs can improve student learning and can be used to supplement other evidence-based instructional practices. Findings: Propensity score matching was used to create equivalent treatment and control groups; results show that students in the CCE implementation section had higher scores on a CS knowledge test than students in the control section, but not higher self-efficacy for their CS knowledge. Focus group and open-ended survey questions indicated that students had mixed reactions to the CCEs, with about half the students seeing them as improving their learning, understanding, and ability to apply CS in their engineering field. Responses also reinforced the importance of fully incorporating CCEs in courses and aligning them with course topics.

J	Dinar, M; Rosen, DW				Dinar, Mahmoud; Rosen, David W.			A Design for Additive Manufacturing Ontology	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						ontology; design for additive manufacturing; design representation		Design for additive manufacturing (DFAM) gives designers new freedoms to create complex geometries and combine parts into one. However, it has its own limitations, and more importantly, requires a shift in thinking from traditional design for subtractive manufacturing. There is a lack of formal and structured guidelines, especially for novice designers. To formalize knowledge of DFAM, we have developed an ontology using formal web ontology language (OWL)/resource description framework (RDF) representations in the Prote eg tool. The description logic formalism facilitates expressing domain knowledge as well as capturing information from benchmark studies. This is demonstrated in a case study with three design features: revolute joint, threaded assembly (screw connection), and slider- crank. How multiple instances (build events) are stored and retrieved in the knowledge base is discussed in light of modeling requirements for the DFAM knowledge base: knowledge capture and reuse, supporting a tutoring system, integration into CAD tools. A set of competency questions are described to evaluate knowledge retrieval. Examples are given with SPARQL queries. Reasoning with semantic web rule language (SWRL) is exemplified for manufacturability analysis. Knowledge documentation is the main objective of the current ontology. However, description logic creates multiple opportunities for future work, including representing and reasoning about DFAM rules in a structured modular hierarchy, discovering new rules with induction, and recognizing patterns with classification, e.g., what leads to "successful" versus "unsuccessful" fabrications.

J	Varadarajan, S				Varadarajan, Sudhir			Contradictions and paradoxes in design-centric engineering education: a complex responsive processes perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN EDUCATION			English	Article						Engineering education; Learning-by-doing; Design; Entrepreneurship; Sociology; Complexity	THINKING	The 1950s saw the emergence of the science-driven model of engineering education. In the following decades, the model has been continuously challenged to incorporate aspects such as liberal arts, information & communication technology, design, entrepreneurship, innovation, sustainability, industry 4.0, and more recently, online-learning. This has triggered several initiatives at institutional and national levels, and manifested in approaches and practices for transforming engineering education. One approach that appears to be gaining attention is design-centric engineering, with its emphasis on learning-by-doing, product design and entrepreneurial orientation. While literature points to several variants of design-centric engineering and challenges in implementation, it also calls for more empirical studies and deeper theoretical inquiry into the contradictions and paradoxes that this approach might present to the students at the micro-level, and guidance on how they might make sense and find pathways of action jointly with internal and external stakeholders. This paper throws light on the contradictions and paradoxes experienced by undergraduate engineering students while implementing a design-centric engineering program at a young public-funded institute in India, involving approximately 1500+ students over a period of six years. The paper also discusses the theoretical and pragmatic aspects of the approach adopted to encourage students to make sense of the contradictions and paradoxes, namely: (a) leveraging the affordance offered by one of the courses in the program-"Sociology of Design-to synthesize engineering, design and sociological perspectives; (b) turning the contradictions and paradoxes into sources of learning and change, informed by the theory of complex responsive processes; and (c) application of multiple methods such as rich pictures, reflective writing, self-organized interactions and data analysis to enable sense-making.

With the emergence of new data collection technologies, advanced data mining and analytics support, there seems to be fundamental changes that are occurring with the research questions we can ask, and the research methods we can apply. The contexts include social networks and blogs, political discourse, corporate announcements, digital journalism, mobile telephony, home entertainment, online gaming, financial services, online shopping, social advertising, and social commerce. The changing costs of data collection and the new capabilities that researchers have to conduct research that leverages micro-level, meso-level and macro-level data suggest the possibility of a scientific paradigm shift toward computational social science. The new thinking related to empirical regularities analysis, experimental design, and longitudinal empirical research further suggests that these approaches can be tailored for rapid acquisition of big data sets. This will allow business analysts and researchers to achieve frequent, controlled and meaningful observations of real-world phenomena. We discuss how our philosophy of science should be changing in step with the times, and illustrate our perspective with comparisons between earlier and current research inquiry. We argue against the assertion that theory no longer matters and offer some new research directions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Derlukiewicz, D				Derlukiewicz, Damian			Application of a Design and Construction Method Based on a Study of User Needs in the Prevention of Accidents Involving Operators of Demolition Robots	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						demolition robot; HMI (Human-Machine Interface); conceptual design; design thinking; resonant frequency; operational system; vibration measurements; remote-controlled machines; sensors; protective system; operator safety		The paper presents a new method of design and construction aimed at developing a system that helps to prevent accidents involving demolition robot operators. The method is based on a study of user needs and was developed in accordance with Design Thinking methodology. This study provides a theoretical review of designing processes and methodologies, including conceptual design, and explores the implementation of the proposed method in the designing process for a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) accident prevention system. An in-depth study of user needs combined with an analysis of the operational system, both of which followed the stages in the proposed method, as well as with experimental tests on a small remote control demolition robot, inspired the development of an operator-controlled HMI system. The theoretical review concerns non-haptic feedback devices, which can be implemented in the demolition robot remote control or in operator safety equipment. Experimental research helped to determine the data necessary to develop an HMI system that continuously uses information from sensors installed on the machine. The paper also addresses issues related to the implementation of the HMI interface in order to avoid failures resulting from robot misuse and to protect the operator from any hazards caused by potential accidents. This paper emphasizes the importance of the connection between man and machine to overcome the lack of direct information flow in the case of mechanical operation.

Equip public managers with data analytics skills: a proposal for the new generation of MPA/MPP programs with data science track	LIBRARY HI TECH			English	Review; Early Access						Curriculum design; Data analytics; Data science; Master of public administration (MPA); Master of public policy (MPP); Network of schools of public policy; affairs; and administration (NASPAA)	BIG-DATA; CHALLENGES; STATISTICS	PurposeThis research uses a multifaceted approach to develop an MPA/MPP curriculum to support a data science track within the existing MPA/MPP programs by identifying the core and elective areas needed.Design/methodology/approachThe approach includes (1) identifying a suitable structure for MPA/MPP programs which can allow the program to develop its capacity to train students with the data science and general public administration skills to solve public policy problems and leave explicit space for local experimentation and modification; (2) defining bridging modules and required modules for the MPA/MPP programs; and (3) developing of data science track thought to make suggestions for the inclusion of suitable data science modules into the data science track and benchmarking the data science modules suggested with the best practices developed by other professional bodies. The authors review 46 NASPAA-accredited MPA/MPP programs from 40 (or 22.7%) schools to identify the suitable required modules and some potential data science and analytics courses that MPA/MPP programs currently provide as electives.FindingsThe proposal includes a three-course (six-nine credits, not counted in the program but as prerequisites) bridging module, a nine-course (27 credits) required module and a five-course (15 credits) data science track/concentration.Originality/valueThis work can provide a starting point for the public administration education community to develop graduate programs focusing on data science to cater to the needs of both public managers and society at large.

We use literacieshow individuals use representations to learnto explore the STEM literacy practices of experienced designers and makers. Describing makers'representationalpractices in STEM contexts can inform the design of literacy supports for young makers that canencourage their use of representations to connect STEM disciplines and design practices. We interviewed experienced makers to describe one literacy practice central to design: identifying, organizing, and integrating information. Makers enacted this practice within specific making processese.g., designingwith the purpose of sourcing and navigating information related to their chosen problems. The research supports efforts to bridge learning while making with learning in schools by positioning STEM literacies as central practices involved in the processes of designing and making.

J	Maurer, H; Stubenrauch, R; Camhy, DG				Maurer, H; Stubenrauch, R; Camhy, DG			Foundations of MIRACLE: Multimedia information repository, a computer-supported language effort	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						visual languages; visual communication; constructed languages; computer-supported communication; information archiving; information retrieval; language independent communication; converging technology; multimedia		Research in neurosciences, cognitive psychology and media sciences indicates that "visual thinking" carries a potential of the human mind that is generally still neglected today but could heavily be fostered by novel types of communicating and archiving information. Computer technology ( information systems, telecommunication and visual tools) in turn promises to provide a wide range of highly effective tools to support visual, dynamic communication. MIRACLE treads new paths to address a crucial issue: In what way and to what extent can and should current and future systems support new ways of communicating and archiving information using dynamic, visual information? This paper gives a survey of the numerous attempts that have been made so far to overcome language barriers by introducing artificial languages ( both on a spoken/text and on a visual basis). It also analyzes the general status of technology ( computer hardware and software) to support such efforts as well as a number of specific projects. From this overview we draw the conclusion that computer-based systems designed to support communicating and archiving dynamic visual information should focus on the following features: . Support dynamic language elements on a structural level in addition to traditional animated icons; . Incorporate gestural language elements ( inspired by natural sign languages) anticipating future ways of human-computer interaction; . Allow evolutionary development of the language in a group-dynamic and interactive process involving large international groups of participants. In a final section we give a brief outline of the cluster of specific projects carried out under the heading of MIRACLE.

J	Williams, AC; Brown, AD; Baidas, Z				Williams, AC; Brown, AD; Baidas, Z			Optimisation in behavioural synthesis using hierarchical expansion: Module ripping	IEE PROCEEDINGS-COMPUTERS AND DIGITAL TECHNIQUES			English	Article								During behavioural synthesis, an abstract functional description of a system is mapped automatically onto a physical structure. In a competitive setting, this mapping is highly optimised (the data flow is re-arranged, units and registers are multiplexed and so on) to deliver a final structure that meets some overall user-supplied specification. Ultimately, however, the physical functional units are drawn from a predefined (human-designed) library; these may be thought of as the leaf-level modules in the design hierarchy. Design reuse and increasing sophistication of module libraries inevitably lead to leaf modules becoming larger and more complex. As these modules are, by definition, atomic, a synthesis system is unable to capitalise on any internal similarities the leaf modules may possess. The design, construction and effects of using a hierarchically defined module library are described in the paper. The set of leaf-level modules made available to the synthesis environment is conventional (add, subtract, multiply and so on), but the optimiser is capable of ripping apart' these modules to manipulate their inner structures. Two advantages accrue from the technique: it is possible to optimise behavioural designs far more effectively, with up to a 65% reduction in area and a 46% reduction in delay; and it is possible to build library modules that have tightly controllable internal timing relationships. This is essential when designing systems that communicate externally via low-level protocols; behavioural synthesis, by its very nature, usually distorts timing information. Using the technique, it is possible to create 'islands of fixed timing' embedded in the synthesised design.

We report here on a classroom case study of dialectical constructivist pedagogy: Students created dialectical analyses of two lectures and four books as core activities in a freshman seminar "Information, People and Technology''. We adapted the functionality of Piazza, a free wiki-style question-answer course management infrastructure, and Toulmin argumentation structures to organize and facilitate these dialectical learning activities. In this paper, we motivate this approach, describe our implementation of it, and present interaction log data and content analysis of Piazza debates, and analysis of student self-reflections on learning activity and consequences, to assess issues in this approach, and directions for further instructional design and research.

Search engines such as Google provide users with keyword suggest tools. This paper aims to investigate users' criteria in relevance judgment regarding Google's keywords suggest tool and to see how such keywords would lead to more relevant results from the viewpoint of users. Design/methodology/approach - Through a mixed method approach, quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 60 postgraduate students at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, using four different instruments (questionnaire, thinking aloud technique, query logs and interviews). Findings - Among other criteria, the "relation between suggested keywords and the information need" (with the mean rate of 3.53 of four) was considered the most important by searchers in selecting suggested keywords for query expansion. Also, the "relation between suggested Keywords and the retrieved items" (with the mean rate of 3.62) was considered the second most important criterion in judging the relevance of the retrieved results. The participants agreed that the suggested keywords by Google improved the retrieval relevance. The content analysis of the participants' aloud-thinking sessions and the interviews approved such findings. Originality/value - This research makes a contribution to the need of designers of IR systems regarding the use of add words for query expansion. It also helps librarians how to instruct searchers with expanding their queries to retrieve more relevant results. Another contribution of the study is the identification of a number of new relevance judgment criteria for Web-based environments.

Hearing and speech are the most commonly used sensory functions for communication. Therefore, a person will suffer unimaginable difficulties with the loss of both functions during her/his life. The problems that a handicapped student might encounter during school are often neglected. The way a teacher teaches during a class and how a student interacts with others should be highlighted. The deficiency in assistive devices for hearing- and speech-impaired people is due to several factors. In fact, there is insufficient information and not enough researchers. The translation of language by foreign assistive devices is more rigorous; however, domestic resources for assistive devices for hearing- and speech-impaired people are limited. No relevant information on learning through assistive devices is available. The subject examined in this study was a hearing-impaired student in her junior year, who lost speech capability after an ear stroke. This study examined the problems that she encountered during her learning in a class with average students. After a literature review and the investigation of the case study, user experience and design thinking approaches were implemented for the development of an assistive device. A class learning assistive system, which is based on a simple innovative design and a highly flexible combination of elements, was created. After a series of experimental verifications and improvements, the results indicated that this learning assistive system could effectively enhance the research subject's confidence and autonomy during learning in class.

J	Chang, TL; Hsin, HT				Chang, Tzyh-Lee; Hsin, Huai-Tzu			The effect of the Self-explain-Discuss-Re-explain (SDR) learning strategy on high- and low-achieving fifth-grade students' achievement in science	RESEARCH IN SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Self-explain-Discuss-Re-explain (SDR) strategy; high; and low-achieving fifth-grade students; independent thinking; position and motion of the sun; student achievement	CROSS-AGE; EXPLANATION; KNOWLEDGE	Background Being able to think independently is a must for students to construct new knowledge in their minds. Self-explaining is a constructive learning strategy that encourages students to think for themselves and to make inferences that go beyond the given information. The Self-explain-Discuss-Re-explain (SDR) strategy adapted from self-explaining is expected to be able to help students learn science and foster the habit of independent thinking. Purpose This study employs a quasi-experimental design to investigate the effects of SDR and traditional strategies on high- and low-achieving fifth-grade students' achievement in learning about the position and motion of the sun. Participants Altogether 104 students participated in this study, with the 52 receiving the SDR strategy designated as the experimental group, and the other 52 receiving the traditional strategy designated as the comparison group. Each student was classified as a high- or low-achiever based on their test scores from the final science exam the previous semester. Design and methods The research instrument for this study was a two-tier multiple-choice test. We used this test for both pre- and post-tests of the experimental group and the comparison group, and then performed statistical analysis on the data obtained from the pre- and post-tests. Results The findings show that the SDR strategy was more effective at helping high- and low-achievers learn about the sun's position and motion and in helping close the achievement gap between them than the traditional strategy was. Conclusions The SDR strategy can help low-achievers catch up with their high-achieving classmates. It can be used to remedy low-achieving students' weaknesses in a specific area of science.

J	Ormerod, RJ				Ormerod, RJ			Putting soft OR methods to work: Information systems strategy development at Palabora	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						information systems strategy; soft OR; mining	OPERATIONAL-RESEARCH; DESIGN; FUTURE	A consultancy project to develop an information systems (IS) strategy for a copper mine located in South Africa is described. The mine is operated by the UK based mining company RTZ, the world's largest mining company. The approach taken was based on an earlier project at Sainsbury's, a major food and grocery retailing chain in the UK. At Sainsbury's a participative approach made use of a number of models and methods developed by the advocates of soft OR and systems thinking. The aim of the Palabora project was to test whether the same participative approach, suitably adapted, would work in a completely different context, and more generally whether this could form the basis of a standard method to be applied at a variety of mine sites. The paper describes the design of the intervention process and the choice of methods for the particular mining context of Palabora, Account had to be taken of the nature of the operation, the remote location and the limited time available. The intervention proved successful, resulting in both an IS strategy for the mine which has since been implemented and a participative approach for IS strategy development for use at other mine sites. However, the soft OR methods played a less significant role than first envisaged. Lessons are drawn for future applications of soft OR methods for strategy development in different circumstances.

Thinking clearly about causal inferences of politically motivated reasoning: why paradigmatic study designs often undermine causal inference	CURRENT OPINION IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES			English	Review							PUBLIC-OPINION; PARTISAN BIAS; BELIEF-BIAS; PARTY; MISPERCEPTIONS; SKEPTICISM; IDEOLOGY; POLICY; FALSE	A common inference in behavioral science is that people's motivation to reach a politically congenial conclusion causally affects their reasoning-known as politically motivated reasoning. Often these inferences are made on the basis of data from randomized experiments that use one of two paradigmatic designs: Outcome Switching, in which identical methods are described as reaching politically congenial versus uncongenial conclusions; or Party Cues, in which identical information is described as being endorsed by politically congenial versus uncongenial sources. Here we argue that these designs often undermine causal inferences of politically motivated reasoning because treatment assignment violates the excludability assumption. Specifically, assignment to treatment alters variables alongside political motivation that affect reasoning outcomes, rendering the designs confounded. We conclude that distinguishing politically motivated reasoning from these confounds is important both for scientific understanding and for developing effective interventions; and we highlight those designs better placed to causally identify politically motivated reasoning.

Among her achievements and pioneering thinking is the development of an integrated methodology for systems implementation named Effective Technical and Human Implementation of Computer Systems (ETHICS) that incorporates job design as part of the systems planning and implementation effort. This study questions why ETHICS initially rose in popularity and then declined over the years. To answer this question, we apply Latour's (1999) five-loop framework to describe the formation of science. The findings reveal that Mumford held and aligned many heterogeneous actors and resources that together contributed to the shaping of ETHICS. As the content of ETHICS was shaped by the intertwining of many elements, when some of these elements later changed and undermined their previous alignment, the content of ETHICS was not reshaped, and hence it lost its status and declined. The paper ends by drawing more general lessons for IS research.

Too much content, not enough thinking, and too little FUN! Adv Physiol Educ 33: 257-264, 2009; doi: 10.1152/advan.00075.2009.-Teachers often overrate the importance of their content and underrate their influence. However, students forget much of the content that they memorize. Thus, attempts to teach students all that they will need to know is futile. Rather, it is important that students develop an interest and love for lifelong learning. Inspiring and motivating students is critical because unless students are inspired and motivated our efforts are pointless. Once students are inspired and motivated, there are countless resources available to learn more about a subject. Thus, teachers must abandon the mistaken notion that unless they "cover the content" students will be unprepared for the future and they will have failed as teachers. Teachers must not worry about "losing" or "wasting" valuable lecture time for in-class discussion, collaborative problem-solving, and inquiry-based activities that take time away from covering content. Rather than worrying about covering content, teachers must design activities to focus student learning on how to use scientific knowledge to solve important questions. This is important because learning is not committing a set of facts to memory but the ability to use resources to find, evaluate, and use information. In fact, memorizing anything discourages deep thinking. Deep thinking is essential because understanding is the residue of thinking! To encourage thinking we must create a joy, an excitement, and a love for learning. We must make learning fun; because if we are successful, our students will be impatient to run home, study, and contemplate-to really learn.

A computer-aided creative design (CACD) system is indispensable to provide effective support for human-oriented creative behavior and iterative decision-making during the conceptual design process. Based on cognition and iteration, this study proposes a triplhelix innovative solving model to guide the construction of CACD system. In this model, three types of space are established, including design flow space as reference for mapping direction, knowledge inspiration space as source of stimulus information, and solution operating space as carrier. The cooperation among the triple space is organized based on memory information processing theory, so as to inspire designers' cognitive thinking to generate product solutions. In addition, the iterative operations of design elements among function, behavior, and structure utilizing the proposed triple space are discussed. With this model, the designers can develop multiple innovative solutions according to expected design types (variant, adaptive, original), and different cognitive stimulation (extension, analogy, mutation) of design knowledge can also be obtained. Then, a prototype system of computer-aided creative design platform is developed to implement this innovative solving model. Finally, a design case of espresso machine is presented to demonstrate the practicability and validity of the prototype system.

It was predicted that participants in the tinnitus group would report fewer positive future events. Methods: A cross-sectional design was used. Two groups of participants completed the test session: tinnitus patients (n=20) and healthy controls (n=20) without tinnitus. Participants completed measures of anticipation of future positive and negative experiences, anxiety and depression. In addition, participants with tinnitus completed a test of tinnitus annoyance. Results: Tinnitus participants generated a greater number of negative future events compared to the controls. There was no difference between the groups on positive future events or on self-reported anxiety, but the tinnitus group scored higher on a depression measure. Controlling for depression scores removed the group difference. Conclusions: While the groups differed on future thinking, the difference concerned negative events, which suggests that anxious information processing might be important in explaining tinnitus annoyance. Levels of depressive symptoms should, however, be considered. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Participants were 97 daughters, who completed a 30-item self-administered questionnaire, a tool designed to identify the information needs of daughters and their communication channels. Daughters also completed the Miller Behavioral Style Scale, a scale used to determine the information-seeking behavior of individuals under threat. Descriptive statistics revealed that the information flows between women with breast cancer and daughters participating in this study were good. Most of the daughters received information from their mothers and asked their mothers questions. Few daughters thought their mothers avoided giving them information. The vast majority of the daughters, however, sought information from sources other than their mothers, indicating that the mothers alone did not satisfy their information needs. More than half of the daughters participating in this study accompanied their mothers to their medical consultations and received information from HCPs. Logistic regression indicated that the communication flows between patients, HCPs, and adult daughters of women with breast cancer depended on a number of factors, in particular, on the amount of communication desired by women with breast cancer.

J	Duan, XJ; Lin, Y				Duan, Xiaojun; Lin, Yi			1. Conservation law of information and its application in evaluation and estimation of complex systems	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Cybernetics; Systems theory; Information systems	UNCERTAINTY EVALUATION	Purpose - Model description, observations, and prior knowledge are the three main sources of information that are used for the evaluation and estimation of complex systems. Here, model description is given based on the physical mechanism and dynamics of the system. Observational data represent a very important method of verification and can be applied to validate the model. Prior knowledge can help to provide additional information when observation data are not sufficient. On the basis of clearly carding the relationship between a system's observational quantities and the ultimate indices of the observation, the purpose of this paper is to establish the systemic yoyo model for systems evaluation. Design/methodology/approach - Recent advances in systems science in general and the systemic yoyo model in particular are employed in this research as the fundamental logic of reasoning and thread of thinking. Findings - After analyzing the characteristics and connections between the three main sources of information model description, prior knowledge, and observational data used in system evaluation and estimation, the authors derive the conservation law of information for system evaluation and estimation and analyze the transitional direction of the process of system evaluation and estimation. Practical implications - This work lays down the theoretical basis for why certain procedures widely applied in system evaluations and estimations are correct and sound, on which reliable scientific conclusions can be drawn. Originality/value - This work is the first of its kind that investigates the systemic foundation underlying the commonly applied procedures of system evaluations and estimations.

An expert team designed and developed Augmented Reality (AR)-based activity schemes for children aged 3-6. A total of 166 preschool students from Ningbo, China, were conveniently sampled to participate in six science activity units. 82 students received AR-based instruction, while 84 were taught using conventional methods. This research employed the "Preschool Learning Behaviors Scale (PLBS)", "Attitude on Science in School Assessment (ATSSA)", as well as "Attitude on AR Activities Scale (ARAAS)" to compare the impact of virtual manipulatives based on AR, as well as physical manipulatives on preschool students' academic accomplishments and attitudes. Outcomes demonstrated that the AR-based science learning system promoted more active learning behaviors and improved learning attitudes. ANOVA analysis verified that AR receptivity remarkably influenced learning attitudes and behaviors, with learning attitudes also remarkably impacting learning behaviors. Furthermore, students exhibited high acceptance of AR technology in science activities.

How Science Teachers DiALoG Classrooms: Towards a Practical and Responsive Formative Assessment of Oral Argumentation	JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Argumentation; Assessment; Critical thinking; Design; Educational technology; Emerging technologies	SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENTATION; FRAMEWORK	We present lessons learned from an ongoing attempt to conceptualize, develop, and refine a way for teachers to gather formative assessment evidence about classroom argumentation as it happens. The system-named DiALoG (Diagnosing Argumentation Levels of Groups)-includes a digital scoring tool that allows teachers to assess oral classroom argumentation across two primary dimensions: one to capture the Intrapersonal, discipline-specific features of scientific arguments, and another to capture the Interpersonal, group regulatory features of argumentation as a dynamic social act. Coupled with the digital assessment are responsive mini-lessons (RMLs), which provide follow-up curriculum for teachers to respond to different levels of classroom argumentation proficiency for each item assessed. We use classroom observations, interviews, and surveys from piloting science teachers in two different states to iteratively refine this multifaceted formative assessment system of oral classroom argumentation. Lessons learned include the realization by pilot teachers that using the DiALoG system fine-tunes their professional vision to notice student practices they had not previously considered, and the accompanying RMLs help fill gaps in their pedagogical content knowledge and repertoire. Furthermore, while the DiALoG system is intended to be a formative assessment, we learned that the mere presence of numerical scores can queue teacher schema for summative assessment. This prompted us to do away with numbers entirely in the latest version of our digital scoring tool. Such lessons learned from teacher experiences with the development of a novel formative assessment system like DiALoG can be instructive to the development of science educational technology more broadly.

This study reviewed the approaches and methods used in current patient experience research by applying the perspective of design thinking to discuss practical methodologies for a patient-centered approach and creative problem-solving. (2) A scoping review was performed to identify research trends in healthcare. A four-stage design thinking process ("Discover", "Define", "Develop", and "Deliver") and five themes ("User focus", "Problem-framing", "Visualization", "Experimentation", and "Diversity"), characterizing the concept, were used for the analysis framework. (3) After reviewing 67 studies, the current studies show that the iterative process of divergent and convergent thinking is lacking, which is a core concept of design thinking, and it is necessary to employ an integrative methodology to actively apply collaborative, multidisciplinary, and creative attributes for a specific and tangible solution. (4) For creative problem-solving to improve patient experience, we should explore the possibilities of various solutions by an iterative process of divergent and convergent thinking. A concrete and visualized solution should be sought through active user interactions from various fields. For this, a specific methodology that allows users to collaborate by applying the integrative viewpoint of design thinking should be introduced.

J	Eaglestone, B; Ford, N; Brown, GJ; Moore, A				Eaglestone, Barry; Ford, Nigel; Brown, Guy J.; Moore, Adrian			Information systems and creativity: an empirical study	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Information systems; Systems software; Music	SUPPORT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report research that sought to understand the requirements of information systems designed to support people engaged in creative intellectual activity. The research aimed to provide empirical evidence based on a case study of a particular arena of creativity, namely electro-acoustic music composition. However, it also sought to identify issues that may apply more widely to other arenas of human creativity. Design/methodology/approach - The research was based on a related series of three in-depth studies of electro-acoustic music composers at work. These studies entailed the collection of qualitative data from interviews, observations and "think aloud" protocols. These data were analysed inductively to reveal concepts and relationships that formed the basis for a model of interactions between the composers and the information systems with which they were working. Findings - The paper presents a model of relationships between information system features and use, and the resulting effects in terms of the extent to which creativity was perceived by the composers to have been facilitated and inhibited. In particular, a number of tensions were identified which suggest that conventional "best practice" in the design of data-intensive information systems may be fundamentally at odds with the requirements of such systems to support important aspects of creativity. Research limitations/implications - The limitations associated with in-depth qualitative research based on small samples is acknowledged, relating in particular to its lack of ability to generalise on the basis of statistical probability. However, Such an approach arguably offers the complementary strength of being particularly suited to exploratory research aimed essentially at charting new territory and identifying rich and possibly unanticipated constructs rather than testing hypotheses based on existing theory. The resultant findings, however, must remain tentative and provisional pending further systematic investigation designed to establish the extent to which they are generalisable. Practical implications - As well as identifying limitations in conventional approaches to designing data-intensive information systems, an alternative architecture is proposed which seeks better to map onto the requirements of creativity support. It is hoped that both the criticisms of conventional approaches and the proposed novel architecture may be of practical use to those engaged in the design of data-intensive creativity support systems. Originality/value - The research reported here offers a novel perspective on the design of information systems in that it identifies a tension between conventional "best practice" in system design and the requirements of important aspects of creativity support. It has the advantage of being based on the in-depth observation of real composers in action over protracted periods of time. It also proposes a novel system architecture which seeks to avoid reduce such tensions.

The design of human-computer interfaces should consider these differences in the cognitive models of users to achieve maximum benefits. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an accepted tool for measuring four dimensions of an individual's cognitive model. This research investigated the effects of two interface designs based on the characteristics of the Sensing/iNtuitive (S/N) and Thinking/Feeling (T/F) categories. These interfaces were designed for the visual information displays of computer-based procedures at a nuclear power plant. Because of the nature of this industry, quicker reaction times are required and fewer mistakes are tolerated. A group of subjects were selected, and the subjects were assigned to either the ST or NT group before the experiment. The results, when compared with earlier statistics for a single design for all users, indicate that reaction times were reduced in some critical situations and the number of mistakes was reduced.

We define a Gaggle as a modest number of managed and actively interacting Grid/Web Services, where services are put together for particular functionality. The information management requirements in Gaggles include both the management of large amounts of relatively static services and associated semantic information as well as the management of multiple dynamic regions (sessions or sub-rids) where the semantic information is changing frequently. We design a hybrid, fault tolerant, and high performance Information Service supporting both the scalability of large amounts of relatively slowly varying data and a high performance rapidly updated Information Service for dynamic regions. We use the two Web Service standards: Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) and Web Services Context (WS-Context). We evaluate our approach by applying various tests to investigate the performance and sustainability of the centralized version of our implementation that is applied to sensor and collaboration grids. The experimental study on system responsiveness of the proposed approach shows promising results. This study indicates that communication among services can be achieved with efficient centralized metadata strategies, with metadata coming from more than two services. In contrast point-to-point methodologies provide service conversation with metaclata only from the two services that exchange information. In addition, Our performance indicates that efficient mediator services also allow us to perform collective operations such as queries on subsets of all available metadata in service conversation.

J	González-Díaz, RR; Bustamante-Cabrera, GI				Gonzalez-Diaz, Romel Ramon; Bustamante-Cabrera, Gladys Ines			Predictive Sequential Research Design to Study Complex Social Phenomena	ENTROPY			English	Article						mixed methodology; research methods; social sciences; complex thinking; design; artificial intelligence; diffuse logic; pluralism; qualitative research	MIXED METHODS; CLASSIFICATION; VALIDITY; SYSTEM	Social phenomena in their simplest form share infinite complexities and relationships, and by interacting with other entities, their levels of complexity become exponentially inexplicable and incomprehensible. Using a single form of study in complex phenomena could be insufficient, and new forms of analysis should be opened that allow for observing the multidimensionality of study problems from integrative perspectives. The emergence of research using mixed methods attempts to reconcile these methodologies through integration, configuring a stage of interconnection between research paradigms that cause cuts and leaks that may or may not be consistent with the study's object. At the time of integration, vices can be created by specific value and subjectivity judgments, with investigative diffraction being an alternative to extend integration through data fracture and redirecting the object of study. This work proposes a Predictive Sequential Research Design (DISPRE) for complex social phenomena, which uses fuzzy logic as a tool to solve the information biases caused by the investigative diffraction of each methodological approach as a strategy to capture, explain, understand and predict the intrinsic complexity of the social entity under study.

People need to be able to appraise the reliability of these claims. The aim of this two-arm cluster-randomized trial was to evaluate the Informed Health Choices secondary school intervention designed to teach students to assess claims about the effects of health actions and make informed decisions.Methods: We conducted the trial among students from 80 secondary schools in five subcounties in Kenya. We used stratified randomization to allocate schools to the intervention or control arm. The intervention included a 2-day teacher training workshop and 10 lessons that addressed nine prioritized key concepts for assessing claims about treatment effects. We did not intervene in the control schools. The primary outcome was the proportion of students with a passing score (& GE; 9/18 correct answers) on the Critical Thinking about Health test, which included two multiple-choice questions for each concept.Results: Between May 11, 2022, and July 8, 2022, we recruited 3362 students and 80 teachers. We allocated 1863 students and 40 teachers to the intervention and 1499 students and 40 teachers to the control arm. In the intervention schools, 1149/1863 (61.7%) of students achieved a passing score compared to 511/1499 (34.1%) in the control schools (odds ratio 3.6 (95% CI 2.5-5.2), p < 0.0001).Conclusions: The intervention had a large effect on students' ability to think critically about health interventions. It is possible to integrate the learning of critical thinking about health within Kenya secondary school curriculum.

There is very limited CR employed in the pharmacy curriculum and practice in the Middle East countries. This study aimed to develop and evaluate CR practice in pharmacy undergraduates in one college of pharmacy in Saudi Arabia. Methods: We employed a mixed-methods methodology that included two phases. In Phase I, students were introduced to CR practice ('think aloud' method) and given geriatric clinical cases which they used in two sessions together with a tutor. This was followed by the writing of SOAP notes using the tutor feedback and completion of a survey that included a self-reflection about their experience of using the CR method. Phase II included face-to-face semi-structured interviews involving selected students that were recruited via convenience sampling to further explore the issues identified in Phase I of the study. Results: Of the 155 students who completed the survey (response rate 94%), the majority of them agreed that CR using the 'think aloud' method was useful in gathering (92%) and interpreting (95%) relevant patient information, identifying medication-related problems (95%), exploring therapeutic options for the problem(s) (93%) and formulating a treatment plan for the patient (90%). Qualitative data analysis of the 12 interviews was consistent with these findings. Furthermore, it provided an insight into the challenges faced by the students in applying this CR method. Conclusions: Students found the practice of CR using the 'think aloud' method helpful in working through given cases and taking clinical decisions. This method can be widely employed in pharmacy education and practice. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

Re-thinking risk communication: information needs of patients, health professionals and the public regarding MRSA - the communicative behaviour of a public health network in Germany responding to the demand for information	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						MRSA; Information needs; Risk communication; Antimicrobial resistance; Public health	RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; CARE-ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS; PREVENTION; PREVALENCE; GUIDELINES; EUROPE	Objectives: Multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO), including Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and health care associated infections (HCAIs) are pressing issues for health care systems across the world. Information and communication are considered key tools for the prevention and management of infectious diseases. Public Health Authorities (PHA) are in a unique position to communicate with health care professionals, patients and the public regarding the health risks. Study design: We used PHA helpdesk interaction data to first ascertain the information requirements of those getting in contact with the service, and secondly to examine the communicative behaviour of the PHA, with a view to improving the quality of communication strategies. Methods: Data on helpdesk interactions between 2010 and 2012 were obtained from a MDRO network of nine German PHAs. 501 recordings were coded and descriptive statistics generated for further qualitative thematic analysis. Results: Our analysis revealed a similar pattern of questions among different groups. Key areas of need for information were around eradication, cleaning and isolation measures. Reported problems were a lack of expert knowledge and continuity of treatment. The helpdesk response was mainly a conversation offering scientific advice, but also included other communication services that went beyond the provision of scientific facts, such as follow-up calls, referral suggestions and consultations on behalf of the caller. These social communication activities seem to have an important impact on the acceptability of public health recommendations and use of the helpdesk. Conclusions: Our findings support a broader discussion about the role of information in the communication process and underline the importance of social elements in the communication process, such as relationship and trust building.

By traditional methods, it is difficult for designers to have an integral priori design experience to fully explore a wide range of design solutions. Therefore, refined intelligent design has become an important trend in design research. More powerful design thinking is needed in intelligent design process. Combining cognitive dynamics and a cobweb structure, an intelligent design method is proposed to formalize the innovative design process. The excavation of the dynamic mechanism of the product evolution process during product development is necessary to predict next-generation multi-image product forms from a larger design space. First, different design thinking stimulates the information source and is obtained by analyzing the designers' thinking process when designing and mining the dynamic mechanism behind it. Based on the nonlinear cognitive cobweb process proposed by Francisco and a natural cobweb structure, the product image cognitive cobweb model (PICCM) is constructed. Then, natural cobweb predation behavior is simulated using a stimulus information source to impact the PICCM. This process uses genetic algorithms to obtain numerous offspring forms, and the PICCM's mechanical properties are the energy loss parameters in the impact information. Furthermore, feasible solutions are selected from intelligent design sketches by the product artificial form evaluation system based on designers' cognition, and a new product image cognitive cobweb system is reconstructed. Finally, a case study demonstrates the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed approach.

It commences from the viewpoint that Information Systems (IS) research benefits from being strategic at every level, from individual researcher, to research program, to research discipline and beyond. It particularly advocates for more coordinated programs of research emphasising real-world impact, while recognising that vibrant, individual-driven and small-team research within broad areas of promise, is expected to continue forming the core of the IS research ecosystem. Thus, the overarching aim is the amplification of strategic thinking in IS research - the further leveraging of an orientation natural to the JSIS community, with emphasis on research programs as a main strategic lever, and further considering how JSIS can be instrumental in this aim.

J	He, XK				He, Xiaoke			Interactive Mode of Visual Communication Based on Information Visualization Theory	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							INTEGRATION; INTERFACE; SCIENCE; DESIGN	In the modern environment, visual communication design has become a comprehensive subject that combines technology and art. The development of various technologies has promoted the emergence of new design art forms, and at the same time, it has also promoted the change of design concepts and thinking modes. Visual representation, as a representation practice to express the meaning of information in the form of visual symbols, is a method and means to realize information visualization. Based on visual interface design, this article takes interactivity and user experience as innovation points and digs into the design process of interactive information visualization to achieve the purpose of information transmission. By analyzing the cognitive tasks of users in each stage of visual thinking activities in visual terminals, this article proposes to optimize the interactive design of visual communication from the key points of attention, consciousness, and memory. In order to verify the feasibility of the interactive mode of visual communication based on information visualization theory, this article has carried out several comparative experiments with different models. Experimental results show that this algorithm has a faster convergence speed and a greater generalization ability, the accuracy of the algorithm reaches 96.03%, and the highest evaluation of user satisfaction is 95.93%. The interactive mode of visual communication in this article can provide means and reference value for the development direction of visual communication design.

In this paper, we propose a Bayesian network-based method for the analysis of the relationships among paper citation and its influencing factors. We investigate the factors that may be related to paper citation, calculate the factor values and determine the factor states. Then we design an amended K2 algorithm for Bayesian network structure learning to handle the situation that no strict sort exists among factors. At last, we use Bayesian network inference to analyse the relationships among paper citation and the influencing factors and present certain interesting findings. We believe the method can provide scholars with new intelligence analysis approach, either for citation analysis or other related issues like talent analysis, research areas analysis, and others.

In this study, we investigated to what extent pre-laboratory activities of a chemical inquiry assignment influence students' independent critical thinking. We compared two forms of pre-laboratory activities that are frequently used in educational practice to prepare students for their inquiry assignments: on the one hand paved road pre-laboratory activities that lead students with sensemaking preparatory questions and on the other, critical-thinking pre-laboratory activities in which students start with the development of an experiment plan using provided information and criteria for a good experimental design. We conducted this study two years in succession in senior year Dutch high school chemistry classes during an inquiry assignment that involved the study of the relation between reaction kinetics and molecular reaction mechanisms of organic nucleophilic substitution reactions (S(N)1/S(N)2). We focused on aspects associated with critical thinking, such as the desire to understand what is observed and to be able to adjust an existing method or model on the basis of experimental data. The results show that the design of pre-laboratory activities strongly influence the critical thinking exhibited by students during their inquiry activities, whereby students who perform critical thinking pre-laboratory activities are more motivated to think more deeply about the meaning of their measurements than students that perform paved road pre-laboratory activities.

There is an inherent need to be fast and efficient to conquer the market. In order to reduce time to market there is a need to shorten the lead-time in design and development process of products. Hence, lead-time is a significant performance metric for a product development organizations having information systems. It is important to explore the factors which affect the process lead-time in information systems. The objective of this study is to explore the impact that usability (one of the factors that may affect the process lead-time) has on process lead-time. This paper presents a case study involving qualitative and quantitate data from Volvo Group, which uses an information system called KOLA for their design and development process. Data was collected through 29 interviews, 17 think aloud sessions, 5 document studies, and 73 responses from a survey. This study identifies which usability factors and heuristics that have an impact on process lead-time. Moreover, the results show that the users level of experience determines the effective utilization of accelerators and thereby affecting the process lead-time. Finally, usability plays an important role in shortening the process lead-time in information systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The test-bed was a 10-week undergraduate introductory information management course. Students from three consecutive school years participated in the study, with the control group studying the conventional course without gamification (first year), treatment group_1 studying a gamified course following the original GAFCC model (second year), and treatment group_2 studying an optimized gamified course following the updated-GAFCC model (third year). The results of the design-based study indicated that (i) the updated-GAFCC model and the GAFCC model were effective in enhancing students' learning achievements and task completion; (ii) the updated-GAFCC model was more successful in generating higher quality thinking artifacts than the GAFCC model; (iii) there were fewer lower-quality submissions in the updated-GAFCC condition than in the GAFCC condition; and (iv) 89% of the interviewed students in the updated-GAFCC condition were satisfied with the overall learning design, and felt that the gamified learning activities facilitated their learning. Overall, the findings contribute to our understanding of how pedagogical strategies can be incorporated into the theory-based design model to optimize learning experiences and academic outcomes.

Exploring College Students' Mental Processing and Decision Making About COVID-19 (Mis)Information on Social Media	JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						incidental learning; cognition; misinformation; social media; socioscientific issues	INCIDENTAL NEWS EXPOSURE; EPISTEMIC COGNITION; POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE; SELECTIVE EXPOSURE; NEED; MOTIVATION; MODELS; METACOGNITION; PLAUSIBILITY; ACHIEVEMENT	More and more, people are abandoning the active pursuit of news, assuming instead that important information will be pushed to them via their social media networks. This approach to news makes people susceptible to the vast amounts of misinformation online, yet research on the effects of this kind of engagement is mixed. More research is needed on technology incidental learning effects, defined as changes in knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors as a result of being exposed to information while pursuing goals other than learning (e.g., entertainment). In this study, we examined how 51 college students responded to incidental exposure to accurate and inaccurate COVID-19 information delivered via a simulated social media environment. Participants' verbalizations during think-aloud protocols indicated numerous mental processes including cognition, metacognition, epistemic cognition, motivation, and emotions. Positively valanced mental processing was more often expressed with accurate COVID-19 information and negatively valanced mental processing was more often verbalized with misinformation. Negatively valanced evaluations of knowledge claims and sources predicted less engagement with COVID-19 misinformation posts. However, in many cases the relations among verbalized mental processing and behavioral responses were complex or nonobvious. For example, participants' positive metacognition and epistemic cognition verbalizations decreased their likelihood of engaging with accurate COVID-19 information, whereas positive interest was associated with an increased likelihood of engaging with misinformation. Our findings have implications for how to accurately infer people's beliefs and intentions from their social media behaviors and how to design interventions to help people be more active and thoughtful consumers of online information.

J	Cheng, KY; Cui, T; Neisch, PM				Cheng, Kaiyu; Cui, Tong; Neisch, Paulina Maria			The Influence of Social Information: A Study of Architectural Attribute from an Event Structure Analysis Perspective	BUILDINGS			English	Article						architectural attribute; actor-network theory (ANT); cartography of controversies; event structure analysis (ESA); social information	CONTROVERSIES	Scientific and technological developments have led to gradual abstraction in architectural research and design. People no longer interpret spatial meaning simply through external forms, rather, the emphasis is put on the essence of design thinking. This change has given rise to analysis and expression methods at the level of the architectural attribute, which scientifically summarize the attributes shared by different architectural types through investigating the literature data and professional phenomena. They improve the architects' level of awareness and provide a guiding framework for subsequent design work. However, rapid social progress and regional cultural differences make it difficult for previous methods to reflect the real-time and in-site expression of the attributes. This paper proposes a new attribute study approach based on Event Structure Analysis (ESA) in combination with social science theory. This approach provides architects with a reference for more comprehensive attribute expression by coordinating the social information at the pre-design stage. Meanwhile, with openness and operability as its technological advantages, it forms a cross-disciplinary research and exchange platform, thereby allowing public participation. The study verifies its feasibility through the structured analysis of specific social events in Beijing, discusses this interdisciplinary approach's practical significance and positive impact at the professional and societal levels, and points out the direction for future research.

The participants of the study are 22 university students. The embedded design was used in the study. The qualitative data consists of the written products of the students, the Maple files, and the transcriptions of argumentations while the quantitative data consists of the pre and post-test scores of the students in CT practices. The implementation was based on ACODESA method. The pre and post-test scores were compared through the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. It was concluded that ACODESA method had a statistically significant effect on students' CT performances in the problem-solving process, cognitive processes and transposition. The qualitative data were analyzed within the framework of Habermas' construct of rationality. It was seen that in the series problem, the students showed improvement in constructing factorial concept and exponential expressions with a for loop, defining events and using them as conditionals within the if-then comparison statement. In the vector problem, the students showed improvement in constructing the components of n-dimensional vectors, constructing a for loop to find the angle between these vectors, using the if-then comparison statement to check the equality of the dimensions. The students were able to act more rationally in choosing and using the CT concepts suitable for the purpose and transferring the CT process to the others, thanks to productive argumentations and the semiotic mediational role of the Maple.

Obstacles and opportunities for networked practice: a social network analysis of an inter-organizational STEM ecosystem	JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						Systems; STEM; Inter-organizational relationship; Social network; Inter-organizational network	FACULTY COMMUNITIES; STRUCTURAL HOLES; SYSTEMS THINKING; CENTRALITY; PRINCIPALS; CAPACITY; LEADERS	Purpose This study responds to major administrative and policy priorities to support science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education by investigating a multi-sector ecosystem of regional organizations that support a STEM pipeline for education and careers. Design/methodology/approach We use social network analysis to investigate an entire region within a geographic region of California which included 316 organizations that represent different stakeholder groups, including educational institutions (school districts, schools and higher education), government, private companies, museums, libraries and multiple community-based organizations. This STEM ecosystem reflects a systems-level analysis of a region from a unique social network perspective. Findings Results indicate that organizations have a surface-level access to STEM-related information, but the deeper and more intense relationship which involves strategic collaboration is limited. Further, interactions around information and collaboration between organizations were purportedly in part to be about education, rarely included PK-12 schools and district as central actors in the ecosystem. In addition, while institutions of higher education occupy a central position in connecting and bridging organizations within the ecosystem, higher education's connectivity to the PK-12 education sector is relatively limited in terms of building research and practice partnerships. Originality/value This research has implications for how regional-level complex systems are analyzed, led and catalyzed and further reflects the need to intentionally attend to the growth of STEM networks.

THINK Back: KNowledge-based Interpretation of High Throughput data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Annual Meeting of the Great Lakes Bioinformatics (GLBIO)	MAY 02-04, 2011	Ohio Univ, Athens, OH		Ohio Univ		GENE SETS; REPRODUCIBILITY; GENOME; TOOL	Results of high throughput experiments can be challenging to interpret. Current approaches have relied on bulk processing the set of expression levels, in conjunction with easily obtained external evidence, such as co-occurrence. While such techniques can be used to reason probabilistically, they are not designed to shed light on what any individual gene, or a network of genes acting together, may be doing. Our belief is that today we have the information extraction ability and the computational power to perform more sophisticated analyses that consider the individual situation of each gene. The use of such techniques should lead to qualitatively superior results. The specific aim of this project is to develop computational techniques to generate a small number of biologically meaningful hypotheses based on observed results from high throughput microarray experiments, gene sequences, and next-generation sequences. Through the use of relevant known biomedical knowledge, as represented in published literature and public databases, we can generate meaningful hypotheses that will aide biologists to interpret their experimental data. We are currently developing novel approaches that exploit the rich information encapsulated in biological pathway graphs. Our methods perform a thorough and rigorous analysis of biological pathways, using complex factors such as the topology of the pathway graph and the frequency in which genes appear on different pathways, to provide more meaningful hypotheses to describe the biological phenomena captured by high throughput experiments, when compared to other existing methods that only consider partial information captured by biological pathways.

Children significantly vary in their spatial performance even before they enter formal schooling. One correlate of children's spatial performance is the spatial language they produce and hear from others, such as their parents. Because the emphasis has been on spatial language, less is known about the role of hand gestures in children's spatial development. Some children are more likely to fall behind in their spatial skills than others. Children born premature (gestational age <37 weeks) constitute such a risk group. Here, we compared performance of term and preterm-born children on two non-verbal spatial tasks-mental transformation and block design. We also examined relations of children's performance on these tasks to parental spatial language and gesture input and their own production of spatial language and gesture during an independent puzzle play interaction. We found that while term and preterm-born children (n = 40) as a group did not differ in the mental transformation or block design performance, children varied widely in their performance within each group. The variability in mental transformation scores was predicted by both a subset of spatial words (what aspects of spatial information) and all spatial gestures children produced. Children's spatial language and gesture were in turn related to their parents' spatial language and gesture. Parental spatial language and gesture had an indirect relation on children's mental transformation, but not block design, scores via children's spatial language, and gesture use. Overall, results highlight the unique contributions of speech and gesture in communicating spatial information and predicting children's spatial performance.

Then the information sharing platform of port supply chain enterprises is proposed. According to the difference of resource nature, it can be divided into different sharing modules to ensure the real-time scheduling of resources and establish a multi-Agent model of supply chain collaboration. Combining the actual situation, the factors of environment and node enterprises are considered in adoption of the integration scheme of web service technology, to realize the real-time sharing of information and complete the research on the information sharing platform of port supply chain enterprises. The contrast experiment is designed so as to analyze and compare the difference of information sharing effect between the designed platform and the traditional platform. It proves to be faster, shorter time-consuming, and better allocation of the supply chain resources through optimization result of the designed platform.

To implement a cooperative learning activity to engage students in analyzing tertiary drug information resources in a literature evaluation course. Design. The class was divided into 4 sections to form expert groups and each group researched a different set of references using the jigsaw technique. Each member of each expert group was reassigned to a jigsaw group so that each new group was composed of 4 students from 4 different expert groups. The jigsaw groups met to discuss search strategies and rate the usefulness of the references. In addition to group-based learning, teaching methods included students' writing an independent research paper to enhance their abilities to search and analyze drug information resources. Assessment. The assignment and final course grades improved after implementation of the activity. Students agreed that class discussions were a useful learning experience and 75% (77/102) said they would use the drug information references for other courses. Conclusion. The jigsaw technique was successful in engaging students in cooperative learning to improve critical thinking skills regarding drug information.

Different fingerprints are used to facilitate a similarity step for database mining, followed by a diversity step to assemble the final library. The method is applied, for example, to build libraries of limited size for hit-to-lead development efforts. In studies designed to inhibit a therapeutically relevant protein-protein interaction, small molecular hits were initially obtained by combined fingerprint- and structure-based virtual screening and used for the design of focused libraries. We review the applied virtual screening approach and report the statistics and results of screening as well as focused library design. While the structures of lead compounds cannot be disclosed, the analysis is thought to provide an example of the interplay of different methods applied in practical lead identification.

J	Bellos, I; Kavadias, S				Bellos, Ioannis; Kavadias, Stylianos			Service Design for a Holistic Customer Experience: A Process Framework	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						customer experience; customer journey; design thinking; service design; service process; service provider; touchpoints	QUALITY; SEQUENCE; UTILITY; INFORMATION; VARIABILITY; PERCEPTIONS; SATIATION; MODELS; WORK	Modern service design practices conceptualize services as multistep processes. At each step, customers derive an uncertain value, which depends on a functional benefit and a subjective experience. The latter may depend on experiences realized at previous steps. Service designs determine the provider effort at each step given that customers prefer less-variable experiences, and enable a holistic perspective of the overall experience. We quantify two factors that shape service designs: the type of steps ((i) routine steps, where effort increases the functional benefit and decreases the experience variability, and (ii) nonroutine steps, where effort increases the functional benefit at the expense of higher variability) and a holistic coupling factor (at each step, the design is determined not only by experience realizations at predecessor steps but also by how it can shape subsequent experiences). The optimal efforts depend on the combination of these two factors, giving rise to actionable design rules. For a positive coupling factor, step type homogeneity leads to 'spread the effort' designs (complementary efforts), whereas a negative coupling factor suggests focusing the effort on a few key steps at the expense of the rest of the service (substitutable efforts). Step type heterogeneity reverses these recommendations. Moreover, when the customer experience unfolds according to a nonstationary process with serial correlation, the effort at each step is determined by an impact zone defined by the steps surrounding the focal service step. Stronger correlation always induces higher effort, whereas weaker correlation may induce less effort in services with heterogeneous step types.

J	He, SJ; Zhang, YS				He, Shenjing; Zhang, Yongsheng			Reconceptualising the rural through planetary thinking: A field experiment of sustainable approaches to rural revitalisation in China	JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES			English	Article						Rurality; Rural-urban relations; Planetary thinking; Rural revitalisation; Green development; China	PROPERTY-RIGHTS; AGROPOLITAN DEVELOPMENT; POST-PRODUCTIVISM; URBAN; GENTRIFICATION; URBANIZATION; VILLAGES	Drawing on a critical reflection on the long-lasting debates of rural-urban dichotomy, we argue for a recon-ceptualisation of the rural that emphasises the ever-evolving and multifaceted nature of rurality to explore alternative pathways of rural revitalisation through non-urban-centric planetary thinking. Instead of viewing the rural and the urban as two contrasting and competing categories, we advocate for planetary thinking that looks beyond spatial boundaries and volumetric changes to focus on the co-evolving multiple trajectories of human -nature interaction, with a particular emphasis on rural transformation. Our propositions are three-fold. First, as an integral and indispensable component of the planetary system, the sustainable and equitable development of the rural is of planetary significance. The harmonious human-nature relations embodied in rural practices hold the key to tackling anthropogenic challenges. Second, rurality is constantly rejuvenated and enriched by new economic and sociocultural practices and technological innovations along with its urban counterpart, during which ruralisation and urbanisation are intersecting and co-evolving at the planetary scale. Third, rural com-munities are important nodes of the planetary networks of resources, people, information, and knowledge connected through multi-directional flows in which the agency of rural communities is increasingly being rec-ognised and strengthened. We then present a field experiment of green development in Shishou, central China to exemplify how this reconceptualisation helps to foster virtuous urban-rural interactions in response to national and global changes to unleash the potentials of the countryside through sustainable revitalisation approaches. While the green development experiment in Shishou is far from ideal, the project demonstrates major break-throughs concerning rural-urban relations and the multifaceted rurality. These new approaches to rural revi-talisation hold the hope for nurturing endogenous growth through empowering local communities and catering to indigenous needs while addressing planetary challenges, which can eventually be scaled up to wider regions and further afield.

The study involved two groups of respondents. The first group included 47 digital design professionals (26 men and 21 women) involved in websites development. The second group included 49 consumers of these goods and services (25 men and 24 women). For the survey of respondents, a validated questionnaire was developed that included characteristics of the main digital design tools used to develop websites and aimed at attracting consumers of goods. The research has shown that the main factors of digital site design, affecting the communication between a manufacturer and consumers, are loading speed, security, usability, and the possibility of feedback. At the same time, designers prioritize the technical parameters of the site and the presence of the target audience, while consumers prioritize user-friendliness, site design, and information security.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been extensively studied as alternatives to antibiotics (ATAs). Coupled with the new generation of high-throughput technology for AMP mining, the number of derivatives has increased dramatically, but manual running is time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, it is necessary to establish databases that combine computer algorithms to summarize, analyze, and design new AMPs. A number of AMP databases have already been established, such as the Antimicrobial Peptides Database (APD), the Collection of Antimicrobial Peptides (CAMP), the Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of Peptides (DBAASP), and the Database of Antimicrobial Peptides (dbAMPs). These four AMP databases are comprehensive and are widely used. This review aims to cover the construction, evolution, characteristic function, prediction, and design of these four AMP databases. It also offers ideas for the improvement and application of these databases based on merging the various advantages of these four peptide libraries. This review promotes research and development into new AMPs and lays their foundation in the fields of druggability and clinical precision treatment.

The article was about the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research in Berlin, established in 1914 as the continuation of the "Neurological Central Station" founded by Oskar Vogt (1870-1959) in 1898. The library metaphor plays on the huge collection of human and animal brains Oskar and his wife Cecile (1875-1862) had gathered over several decades. For examination, the brains were cut into paper-thin slices and embedded in paraffin: from one single organ, up to 30,000 slices could be extracted, which were to be "read" and studied like the pages of a book. In this chapter, we take the metaphor at face value, arguing that Vogt's institute actually functioned as a library. Numerous publications have emphasized the role of the Vogts and, in particular, of the brain collection for the constitution of modern neuroscience. The "library," however, has never been closely investigated. How was it designed? How was it filled? According to which criteria were the brains collected and ordered? How did the order and the collection itself reflect the Vogts' research program? Through a detailed investigation of the collection and the Vogt Archive, we will examine this "library" and reconstruct the order of the Vogt brains. The mutual relationship between collecting, sorting, examining and publishing about the brain will be discussed.

The goal of this project is to combine artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of things, parameterization, and other computer technologies with the industrial environment and health design and development process of manufacturing enterprises to solve pain points for businesses and designers, as well as to develop and create a large-scale product-level general parameter intelligent design software. The development of this software project can greatly improve the work efficiency of designers, save the time spent by designers on low-end repetitive labor, and in turn promote designers to engage in more valuable creative work and realize the digitization of entire product life cycle. It can also improve the inefficient and redundant work efficiency of designers, and designers can switch between multiple roles. At the same time, a design think tank is formed through the accumulation of enterprise design knowledge through data, and the neural network platform development of big data drives the design brain, that is, an efficient and intelligent industrial environment and health design expert system is generated, just like the enterprise brain, including expert think tanks, internal technical data encryption of enterprises interface, enterprise core technology think tank, enterprise production resources, risk control standard library, etc.	[Xu, Lijun; Zheng, Jing; Chen, Wei; Chen, Lu] Nanjing Inst Technol, Inst Art & Design, Nanjing 211167, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Gao, Jun] ABB Beijing Drive Syst Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China	Nanjing Institute of Technology	Zheng, J (corresponding author), Nanjing Inst Technol, Inst Art & Design, Nanjing 211167, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.	zhengjing@njit.edu.cn			Innovation Fund General Project; Innovation Fund General Project, theproject proposed by the Nanjing University of Technology in 2021, "Research on the Design and Application of Intelligent Interaction Platform based on 5G Technology" [CKJB202111]; Teaching Reform and Construction Project of Nanjing University of Technology in 2021, " Exploration and practice of "Art and Engineering" in product design under the background of new liberal arts" [JXGG2021032]; Jiangning District 2022 Philosophy and Social Science Research Project, Research and Development of Industrial Design Neural Network Platform for Small Data-Driven Enterprise Intelligent Brain under the "Intelligent Reform and Digital Transformation" [JNSK202208]; general program of the youth fund of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China in 2022	Innovation Fund General Project; Innovation Fund General Project, theproject proposed by the Nanjing University of Technology in 2021, "Research on the Design and Application of Intelligent Interaction Platform based on 5G Technology"; Teaching Reform and Construction Project of Nanjing University of Technology in 2021, " Exploration and practice of "Art and Engineering" in product design under the background of new liberal arts"; Jiangning District 2022 Philosophy and Social Science Research Project, Research and Development of Industrial Design Neural Network Platform for Small Data-Driven Enterprise Intelligent Brain under the "Intelligent Reform and Digital Transformation"; general program of the youth fund of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China in 2022	This work was supported by Innovation Fund General Project, theproject proposed by the Nanjing University of Technology in 2021, "Research on the Design and Application of Intelligent Interaction Platform based on 5G Technology" (Project no.

J	Shealy, T; Klotz, L; Weber, EU; Johnson, EJ; Bell, RG				Shealy, Tripp; Klotz, Leidy; Weber, Elke U.; Johnson, Eric J.; Bell, Ruth Greenspan			Using Framing Effects to Inform More Sustainable Infrastructure Design Decisions	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Project planning and design	PROSPECT-THEORY; LOSS AVERSION; QUERY THEORY; CONSTRUCTION; PREFERENCES; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION; MOTIVATION; BUILDINGS; ANCHORS	Decision aids, ranging from rating systems to design software to regulatory standards, guide the design and evaluation of infrastructure projects. To present the information in these decision aids, there must first be some options such as, attributes are or are not presented, and, just as in other domains, these factors are likely to influence decisions in infrastructure development. The authors of this paper seek to better understand how choice structures influence engineering decisions. Prospect theory, which is well established in the behavioral sciences, asserts that people tend to think of possible outcomes relative to their starting point, not the resulting end point. For instance, framing a decision outcome as a loss in value (rather than a gain) can reduce the decision makers' acceptance of risk and, in turn, lead to more conservative outcomes. To measure framing effects in engineering decisions, this paper uses the Envision rating system for sustainable infrastructure, which aims to help civil engineers achieve the highest feasible sustainability performance in their projects. The hypothesis is that Envision's framework inadvertently limits the likelihood that engineers will set the highest achievable goals for sustainability. In the current framework, engineers start with zero points and achieve points when design considerations move beyond conventional construction standards. In this modified experimental version, a higher benchmark is set. Engineers are endowed points and can lose them for not maintaining high goals for sustainability. Engineering professionals (n=65) used Envision to make tradeoffs about site programming and functionality for a rural redevelopment project. Participants were randomly assigned the standard version (n=33) or the experimental version (n=32). The experimental group achieved 66% of points compared with the standard group's 51% (p<0.01). These results indicate that a choice posed as a loss rather than a gain significantly improved engineers' consideration for sustainability achievement. The findings suggest the need for more thoughtfully designed decision aids, with guidance from established behavioral science. This type of interdisciplinary research holds the potential to yield relatively low-cost solutions that support greater sustainability in infrastructure development.

Hence, adaptive designs and health economics aim to facilitate efficient and accurate decision making. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the methods are considered together in the design, analysis, and reporting of trials. This review aims to establish how health economic outcomes are used in the design, analysis, and reporting of adaptive designs. Methods: Registered and published trials up to August 2016 with an adaptive design and health economic analysis were identified. The use of health economics in the design, analysis, and reporting was assessed. Summary statistics are presented and recommendations formed based on the research team's experiences and a practical interpretation of the results. Results: Thirty-seven trials with an adaptive design and health economic analysis were identified. It was not clear whether the health economic analysis accounted for the adaptive design in 17/37 trials where this was thought necessary, nor whether health economic outcomes were used at the interim analysis for 18/19 of trials with results. The reporting of health economic results was suboptimal for the (17/19) trials with published results. Conclusions: Appropriate consideration is rarely given to the health economic analysis of adaptive designs. Opportunities to use health economic outcomes in the design and analysis of adaptive trials are being missed. Further work is needed to establish whether adaptive designs and health economic analyses can be used together to increase the efficiency of health technology assessments without compromising accuracy.

The relationship between different packaging design elements and their effect on consumers' online buying decisions has been less researched, due in part to the lack of statistical power to detect cause and effect relationships between these elements. This study examines the feasibility of multiple-criteria decision-making in order to identify and analyze the causal relationships between the different packaging design elements that are required to stimulate consumers' decision to buy products online. Consumers' direct, indirect, and interdependent behaviors in relation to PDEs and purchase decisions were studied for this paper. A total of 142 students (89 males and 53 females, aged 22-37 years) participated in this study. The results identified several associations between design elements. The four most important PDEs found to influence consumers' decision to buy via the internet were graphics, colours, label information, and country of origin. This study provides the necessary insights into the design of product packaging by targeting aspects related to the appearance of the products' characteristics. Correlations between the various PDEs obtained from this study can be used to increase consumers' interactions with products in e-commerce environments.

J	Hu, Y; Hwang, GJ				Hu, Ying; Hwang, Gwo-Jen			Promoting students' higher order thinking in virtual museum contexts: A self-adapted mobile concept mapping-based problem posing approach	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Early Access						Virtual museum; Self-adapted concept mapping; Problem-posing; Higher-order thinking skills; Mobile learning	CONCEPT MAP; LEARNING ACHIEVEMENT; PERCEPTIONS; ADOPTION; SKILLS; FLOW; GAME	This study explored the effects of a self-adapted mobile concept mapping-based problem-posing (CMPP) approach applied in a virtual museum context. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a quasi-experimental design was applied to compare the critical thinking tendency, meta-cognition tendency, problem-solving tendency, computational tendency, cognitive load, and flow experience of college level students using the self-adapted mobile CMPP approach to those using the conventional mobile-based problem-posing and points-listing approach. A total of 56 university students from two classes were involved in the experiment. The two classes of students adopted different approaches to learning in the virtual museum for comparing their critical thinking tendency, meta-cognition tendency, problem-solving tendency, and computational tendency as well as flow experience and cognitive load. One class with 29 students was the experiment group adopting the self-adapted mobile CMPP approach, while the other class with 27 students was the control group using the conventional mobile-based learning approach. The results of the study showed that the proposed strategy could significantly improve learners' critical thinking tendency, meta-cognition tendency, problem-solving tendency, and computational tendency compared to the conventional approach. Though the proposed approach raised slightly higher flow experience and cognitive load, there was no significant difference between the flow experience and the cognitive load of the proposed approach and that of the control group. The interview results complemented the experimental results and indicated that the proposed approach was effective in terms of developing learners' thinking capability, knowledge construction, and self-learning capability.

J	Wu, B; Peng, XL; Hu, YL				Wu, Bian; Peng, Xiaoling; Hu, Yiling			How to foster pre-service teachers' STEM learning design expertise through virtual internship: a design-based research	ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						STEM learning design; Pre-service teachers; Online STEM PST training environment; Design tool; Learning analytics	ONLINE PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; CONTENT KNOWLEDGE; TECHNOLOGY; EDUCATION; INFORMATION; ANALYTICS; THINKING	Designing a lesson plan for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is an important skill in STEM teaching. It requires systematic training that begins at the pre-service stage. It is particularly difficult to help pre-service teachers (PSTs) develop their ability to design an integrated STEM learning unit that features competence-oriented, interdisciplinary, student-centered, authentic, and collaborative learning. Through three rounds of iterative design, this study aimed to develop a technology-enhanced STEM PST training solution. Each round of design sought to address practical issues that had been identified during the implementation of the training in the previous stage. When developing the program, we articulated five principles that guided our design, the final outcome of which was an online teacher training environment integrated with a visual learning design tool and a learning analytics function. We discuss the implications of our research in terms of recommended design principles for STEM PST training, and we suggest directions for future research on the cultivation of STEM learning design expertise.

Service innovation involves a new process or service offering that creates value for one or more actors in a service network. Service design brings new service ideas to life through a human-centered and holistic design thinking approach. However, service design and innovation build on dispersed multidisciplinary contributions that are still poorly understood. The special issue that follows offers important contributions through the examination of service design and innovation literature, the links between service design and innovation, the role of customers in service design and innovation, and service design and innovation for well-being. Building on these contributions, this article develops a future research agenda in three areas: (1) reinforcing and expanding the foundations of service design and innovation by integrating multiple perspectives and methods; (2) advancing service design and innovation by improving the connection between the two areas, deepening actor involvement, and leveraging the role of technology; and (3) upframing service design and innovation to strengthen research impact by innovating complex value networks and service ecosystems and by building a cornerstone for transformative service research.

J	Mountain, D; Liarokapis, F				Mountain, David; Liarokapis, Fotis			Mixed reality (MR) interfaces for mobile information systems	ASLIB PROCEEDINGS			English	Article						reality; mobile communication systems; information systems; geography	LOCATION-BASED SERVICES; AUGMENTED REALITY	Purpose - The motivation for this research is the emergence of mobile information systems where information is disseminated to mobile individuals via handheld devices. A key distinction between mobile and desktop computing is the significance of the relationship between the spatial location of an individual and the spatial location associated with information accessed by that individual. Given a set of spatially referenced documents retrieved from a mobile information system, this set can be presented using alternative interfaces of which two presently dominate: textual lists and graphical two-dimensional maps. The purpose of this paper is to explore how mixed reality interfaces can be used for the presentation of information on mobile devices. Design/methodology/approach - A review of relevant literature is followed by a proposed classification of four alternative interfaces. Each interface is the result of a rapid prototyping approach to software development. Some brief evaluation is described, based upon thinking aloud and cognitive walk-through techniques with expert users. Findings - The most suitable interface for mobile information systems is likely to be user- and task-dependent; however, mixed reality interfaces offer promise in allowing mobile users to make associations between spatially referenced information and the physical world. Research limitations/implications - Evaluation of these interfaces is limited to a small number of expert evaluators, and does not include a full-scale evaluation with a large number of end users. Originality/value - The application of mixed reality interfaces to the task of displaying spatially referenced information for mobile individuals.

Intrinsic Dimensionality as a Metric for the Impact of Mission Design Parameters	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						intrinsic dimensionality; mission design; hyperspectral; imaging spectroscopy; surface biology and geology	SOIL-MOISTURE; COMPONENTS; NUMBER	High-resolution space-based spectral imaging of the Earth's surface delivers critical information for monitoring changes in the Earth system as well as resource management and utilization. Orbiting spectrometers are built according to multiple design parameters, including ground sampling distance (GSD), spectral resolution, temporal resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio. Different applications drive divergent instrument designs, so optimization for wide-reaching missions is complex. The Surface Biology and Geology component of NASA's Earth System Observatory addresses science questions and meets applications needs across diverse fields, including terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, natural disasters, and the cryosphere. The algorithms required to generate the geophysical variables from the observed spectral imagery each have their own inherent dependencies and sensitivities, and weighting these objectively is challenging. Here, we introduce intrinsic dimensionality (ID), a measure of information content, as an applications-agnostic, data-driven metric to quantify performance sensitivity to various design parameters. ID is computed through the analysis of the eigenvalues of the image covariance matrix, and can be thought of as the number of significant principal components. This metric is extremely powerful for quantifying the information content in high-dimensional data, such as spectrally resolved radiances and their changes over space and time. We find that the ID decreases for coarser GSD, decreased spectral resolution and range, less frequent acquisitions, and lower signal-to-noise levels. This decrease in information content has implications for all derived products. ID is simple to compute, providing a single quantitative standard to evaluate combinations of design parameters, irrespective of higher-level algorithms, products, applications, or disciplines.

This study adopted the Double Diamond Process of service design comprising the discover, define, and development stages. We identified 7 issues, organized into 10 healthcare service design concepts associated with NICU education: improving the design of educational material, improving materials for high-risk infant guidance, a practicum kit, a parent proficiency checklist, a systematic parent education manual, predictable guidelines for tests and treatment plans, waiting time that provides comfort, message cards that convey feelings, a reservation system for visits, and a post-discharge information sharing platform. The service concepts' effectiveness was verified through evaluations by healthcare experts. The results represent customers' perspectives and experiences regarding parental education. The application of the healthcare service design method could be further developed in future studies. The 10 service concepts derived from this study can be applied and evaluated as specific NICU educational programs.

It exhibits the technology level of a country. Chemists used to find the candidate material according to property regression and quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR). Traditional methods focus on finding new molecule from prior knowledge with trial and error experiments. They are time-consuming and low efficiency on screening molecules. The appearance of machine learning (ML) changes this embarrassing situation in two ways. One is accelerating the property prediction process to prevent wasting time on worse candidates. The other is inverse molecule design which expands the imagination of human. Lots of researches show promising results using different inverse design method such as, variational auto-encoder (VAE), generative adversarial networks (GAN), reinforcement learning (RL), and recurrent neural network (RNN). They introduce uncertainty from different level to generate new structure candidates. In any method, molecule descriptor has a great impact on the result. The descriptor converts the 3D structures in real world to a vector or a notation string to feed into all kinds of ML models. Large number of descriptors have been developed in cheminformatic, bioinformatic, quantum chemistry and natural language process (NLP). Some classical descriptors are Coulomb matrix (CM), smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP), weighted graph (WG), simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES). They show different advantages and solving problems from different aspects. CM has clear definition and good result on energy regression. SOAP is good at reflecting local environment features of an atom. However, they are easy to encode but hard to decode. That is a reason why people prefer WG and SMILES in the structure inverse design tasks. WG and SMILES express structure as a graph (an atom as a node and a bond as an edge) or string to apply massive mature GNN or NLP algorithm on them. Nowadays, most of the ML applications on chemistry and molecule science are focus on developing new model to regress properties. However, it is thought that there is still large improving space on inverse design methods and traditional descriptors. In this paper, WG and SMILES are briefly introduced firstly. Then, four generative models are presented, including VAE, GAN, RL and RNN. Further, the current progress and challenges of inverse design methods are summarized case by case.

How to improve students "interest in program logic design and help overcome students" fears of coding has become vital for educators. Cultivating practical talents with information technology application and basic programming development will become one of the important topics in the department of information related science. The objective of this research is to improve the ability of learning basic programming courses by using Zuvio interactive software. Zuvio employs the mathematical logic of computational thinking to analyze problems and enhance learners' interest in learning programming skills through a graphical interface tool with building blocks. It uses innovative interactive teaching to use peer and self-assessment to study the content of the course. Zuvio improves the design ability of different groups of class learning Python programming. In line with the innovative teaching policy of the schools and the current stage of the learner's learning model, learning effectiveness can be achieved. The research results were analyzed by midterm and final experimental group scores, and the progress of the experimental group's scores was examined through descriptive statistics. The average and standard deviation of the assessment were used to analyze the progress of the experimental group students in the programming course. In the classroom, assessment criteria were set up as the basis for peer assessment scoring. After the midterm and final exams, the teacher assessment and peer assessment scores were analyzed for cognitive differences, and possible learning differences were analyzed. The students' professional ability was examined to see if it met the professional standards required by the course, and whether innovative teaching methods could improve the learning outcomes of learners with different professional backgrounds in Python programming.

Becoming information centric: the emergence of new cognitive infrastructures in education policy	JOURNAL OF EDUCATION POLICY			English	Article						Automation; artificial intelligence; data science; education; infrastructure; policy	LIMITS	New cognitive infrastructures are emerging as digital platforms and artificial intelligence enable new forms of automated thinking that shape human decision-making. This paper (a) offers a new theoretical perspective on automated thinking in education policy and (b) illustrates how automated thinking is emerging in one specific policy context. We report on a case study of a policy analysis unit ('The Centre') in an Australian state education department that has been implementing a BI strategy since 2013. The Centre is now focused on using BI to support complex decision making and improve learning outcomes, and their strategy describes this focus as becoming 'information centric'. The theoretical framework for our analysis draws on infrastructure studies and philosophy of technology, particularly Luciana Parisi's recent work on automated thinking. We analyse technical documentation and semi-structured interview data to describe the enactment of a BI strategy in The Centre, with a focus on how new approaches to data analytics are shaping decision-making. Our analysis shows that The Centre is developing a cognitive infrastructure that is already creating new conditions for education policy making, and we conclude with a call for research designs that enable pragmatic exploration of what these infrastructures can do.

However, findings remain mixed, and there has not been a review of the association between FVM access and childhood obesity. A comprehensive and systematic understanding of this epidemiologic relationship is important to the design and implementation of relevant public health policies. In this study, a literature search was conducted in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science for articles published before 1 January 2019 that focused on the association between neighbourhood FVM access and weight-related behaviours and outcomes among children and adolescents. Eight cross-sectional studies, two longitudinal studies, and one ecological study conducted in five countries were identified. The median sample size was 2142 +/- 1371. Weight-related behaviours and outcomes were used as the outcome variable in two and eight studies, respectively, with one study using both weight-related behaviours and outcomes as outcome variables. We still found a negative association between access to FVMs in children's residential and school neighbourhoods and weight-related behaviours and an inconclusive association between FVM access and overweight or obesity. This conclusion should be regarded as provisional because of a limited amount of relevant evidence and may not be a strong guide for policymaking. Nonetheless, it points to an important research gap that needs to be filled if successful public health interventions are to be undertaken.

Growing works on computer-aided tools have explored the retrieval of knowledge and heuristics from design data. However, they only provide stimuli to inspire designers from limited aspects. This study explores the recent advance of the natural language generation (NLG) technique in the artificial intelligence (AI) field to automate the early stage design concept generation. Specifically, a novel approach utilizing the generative pretrained transformer (GPT) is proposed to leverage the knowledge and reasoning from textual data and transform them into new concepts in understandable language. Three concept generation tasks are defined to leverage different knowledge and reasoning: domain knowledge synthesis, problem-driven synthesis, and analogy-driven synthesis. The experiments with both human and data-driven evaluation show good performance in generating novel and useful concepts.

J	Pammer-Schindler, V; Prilla, M				Pammer-Schindler, Viktoria; Prilla, Michael			The Reflection Object: An Activity-Theory Informed Concept for Designing for Reflection	INTERACTING WITH COMPUTERS			English	Article						activity theory; reflective learning; reflection; design theory; reflective informatics; computer-mediated reflection	THINKING; SYSTEMS	A substantial body of human-computer interaction literature investigates tools that are intended to support reflection, e.g. under the header of quantified self or in computer-mediated learning. These works describe the issues that are reflected on by users in terms of examples, such as reflecting on financial expenditures, lifestyle, professional growth, etc. A coherent concept is missing. In this paper, the reflection object is developed based on activity theory, reflection theory and related design-oriented research. The reflection object is both what is reflected on and what is changed through reflection. It constitutes the link between reflection and other activities in which the reflecting person participates. By combining these two aspects-what is reflected on and what is changed-into a coherent conceptual unit, the concept of the reflection object provides a frame to focus on how to support learning, change and transformation, which is a major challenge when designing technologies for reflection. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS The reflection object is both what is reflected on and what is changed through reflection. Designing for reflection means to identify what is relevant to users and what can be changed (the reflection object), how to represent this reflection object and which contextual information is necessary to understand the object and its development in time. The object's representation is a tool for reflection; it triggers reflection and creates communicative context. The concept of reflection object as a conceptual tool creates a focus to think in parallel about that which is reflected on and that which changes; to think in parallel about the sameness of and change in the reflection object; to think in parallel about reflection and the activity for which this reflection is important as the reflection constitutes elements of or a complete linked activity.

The objective of this paper is to describe a methodology for obtaining insights into patient safety features-derived from investigations of institutional decision making-that could be incorporated into medical devices by their designers. The design cycle of a product, be it a medical device, software, or any kind of equipment, is similar in concept, and course. Through a series of steps we obtained information related to medical errors and patient safety. These were then utilized to customize the generic device design cycle in ways that would improve the production of critical care devices. First, we provided individuals with different levels of expertise in the clinical, administrative, and engineering domains of a large hospital setting with hypothetical clinical scenarios, each of which described a medical error event involving health professionals and medical devices. Then, we asked our subjects to "think-aloud" as they read through each scenario. Using a set of questions as probes, we then asked our subjects to identify key errors and attribute them to various players. We recorded and transcribed the responses and conducted a cognitive task analysis of each scenario to identify different entities as "constant," "partially modifiable," or "modifiable." We compared our subjects' responses to the results of the task analysis and then mapped them to the modifiable entities. Lastly, we coded the relationships of these entities to the errors in medical devices. We propose that the incorporation of these modifiable entities into the device design cycle could improve the device end product for better patient safety management. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This paper discusses risk perception and intelligent decision-making under the complex social information network to maintain social security and financial security. Design/methodology/approach Cross-modal semantic fusion and social risk perception, temporal knowledge graph and analysis, complex social network intelligent decision-making methods have been studied. A big data computing platform of software and hardware integration for security combat is constructed based on the technical support. Findings The software and hardware integration platform driven by big data can realize joint identification of significant risks, intelligent analysis and large-scale group decision-making. Practical implications The integrated platform can monitor the abnormal operation and potential associated risks of Listed Companies in real-time, reduce information asymmetry and accounting costs and improve the capital market's ability to serve the real economy. It can also provide critical technical support and decision support in necessary public opinion monitoring and control business. Originality/value In this paper, the theory of knowledge-enhanced multi-modal multi-granularity dynamic risk analysis and intelligent group decision-making and the idea of an inference think tank (I-aid-S) is proposed. New technologies and methods, such as association analysis, time series evolution and super large-scale group decision-making, have been established. It's also applied in behavior and situation deduction, public opinion and finance and provides real-time, dynamic, fast and high-quality think tank services.

Design: The cognitive processes of less-skilled and more-skilled golfers were examined during putting using concurrent, think-aloud verbal reports. The design included putting conditions that differed in complexity and thus the need to adapt the putt to the particular conditions. Method: Putting complexity was manipulated via changes to putt length and perceived stress during putting. Putts were executed from two starting locations (i.e., the same starting location as the previous putt or a new starting location). Results: The analysis showed that, during putting: more thoughts were verbalized overall by more skilled golfers than less-skilled golfers; both groups verbalized more thoughts overall during higher complexity putts (i.e., longer distance putts, and putts under higher stress when executed from a new starting location) than lower-complexity putts; and the two groups did not differ significantly in the number of thoughts related to motor mechanics. Conclusions: The results of this study provide support for a cognitive control account of skilled performance and suggest that the path to skilled performance involves the acquisition of more refined higher level cognitive representations mediating planning and analysis.

However, the association between stereotyping, concomitant with perceived threat, and anxiety, was rarely investigated. The current study examined information processing attributes and exposure to terror as predictors of PTSD symptoms among youth at inter-group conflict, with stereotypical thinking toward a threatening out-group as a possible mediator. Design: Cross-sectional, with exposure to terror, need for cognitive structure (NCS), efficacy at fulfilling the need for closure (EFNC) and self-esteem, predicting stereotypical thinking and PTSD symptoms. Method: Ninth graders (N=263) from two residential areas in Israel, varying in their degree of exposure to terror, responded to a self-report questionnaire tapping the above variables. Results: Stereotypical thinking was found to mediate the association between exposure to terror and PTSD symptoms, but not the association between the NCS and EFNC interaction and PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: The findings support terror management theory, so that a negative and rigid perception makes it difficult to construct coherent world-view, thus contributing to aggregation of existential anxiety and PTSD symptoms.

Not only the gap of education between urban and rural students but also the gap of access to information and communications technology also exists. Thus, an effort to resolve this gap is necessary. This study combines novel engineering, which is the fusion of engineering and literacy educational methods with maker education, to create a sustainable model of maker education. Through this process, an instructional model for a novel engineering-based maker education is proposed that would enable the utilization of the model in rural elementary school environment. To achieve this, this study analyzed the literature regarding maker education, novel engineering, and design thinking to develop, draft, and verify internal validity through an expert's review and usability evaluation. In addition, this study includes an example class for rural elementary students with application of the model to verify the model's external validity and confirm that the model significantly improved the maker mindset. Finally, this study proposes final instructional model by modifying and improving the draft based on the recommendations derived from the validity verification process. The proposed instructional model was developed as a suitable form for rural school students, which can use low-cost teaching tools to lower the entry barrier to information and communications technology education. The model process developed in this study has the advantage of raising convergence problem-solving abilities and the maker mindset, in terms of a making project that fuses literature and engineering, among students.

Increased attention to evidence may have numerous benefits for public health practice, including access to higher-quality information on what works, a higher likelihood of successful programs and policies being implemented, greater workforce productivity, and more efficient use of resources. To broaden thinking on the sources and scope of evidence, the three reviews in this symposium seek to (a) compare and contrast several evaluation designs that are alternatives to the randomized controlled trial; (b) describe two research approaches that are useful in addressing complex, multilevel public health issues (i.e., mixed methods research and mixed studies reviews); and (c) provide an overview of the value and approaches for generating practice-based evidence. These reviews highlight the complexity and interrelatedness of public health challenges, limitations of researcher-driven, quantitative approaches, and the need to broaden our current concepts of evidence.

There has been convincing research that these "systems thinking" skills can be learned. However, there is little research on methods for teaching these skills to children or assessing their impact. The Environmental Dashboard is a technology that uses "sociotechnical" feedback-information feedback designed to affect thought and behavior. Environmental Dashboard (ED) combines real-time information on community resource use with images and words that reflect pro-environmental actions of community members. Prior research indicates that ED supports the development of systems thinking in adults. To assess its impact on children, the technology was installed in a primary school and children were passively exposed to ED displays. This resulted in no measurable impact on systems thinking skills. The next stage of this research examined the impact of actively integrating ED into lessons on electricity in 4th and 5th grade. This active integration enhanced both content-related systems thinking skills and content retention.

Media use during conflicts: Information seeking and political efficacy during the 2012 Mexican elections	GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY			English	Article						Uses and gratifications theory; Social media; Political information efficacy; Mexico	INTERNET USE; GRATIFICATIONS; TRUST; GOVERNMENT; KUWAIT; IMPACT	Public access to accurate and reliable information is fundamental to democracy and democratic decision-making. In emerging democracies, during political crises or controversial elections, reliable information is often difficult to obtain. In authoritarian regimes, citizens' perceptions of information reliability are tightly linked to trust in government, and both are typically low. Open government policies help build trust that is essential during protests or contentious elections. Uses and gratifications (U&G) theory states that people use diverse media to try to satisfy their need for reliable information. Gratifying this need is tied to the larger concept of political information efficacy (PIE), i.e., the belief a person holds about him/herself as being politically informed and competent to participate in political thought and action. We investigated these inter-related concepts by administering a survey to an opportunity sample of young adults at a public state university in Mexico. We find that respondents perceived that information from face-to-face and telephone communication with members of their social network, as well as online sources were the most reliable. Information from offline sources, such as TV and newspapers, especially pro-government sources, were the least reliable. Further, the information factors of availability, reliability, influence and sharing had positive relationships with PIE. These results suggest that in conditions of uncertain political information, social networks and online information sources are essential to political information efficacy and democratic political participation.

J	Skyttner, L				Skyttner, L			Systems theory and the science of military command and control	KYBERNETES			English	Article						cybernetics; control systems; complexity theory; armed forces		Purpose - To propose a new military academic area called the "Science of Military Command and Control" which will demand an entirely new way of thinking regarding decision-making command and control and use of modem technology. Design/methodology/approach - Defines basic terms and concepts of the discipline and a meta-theory consisting of General Systems Theory and its related areas is presented. Findings - Three main perspectives are recommended where the first is General Systems Theory, the second is the Cybernetics Regulatory Paradigm and the third is Communication and Information Theory. The components of military command and control system were analysed and a general model for information system development recommended. Research limitations/implications - Current thinking in favour of a "network-defense" that is based on information and communication technology has changed the traditional perspective. New thinking and research development is required. New research using scientific approach is needed. Practical implications - Shows that the old and exact strategies for Swedish defence has totally changed. New military academic area is proposed and a general model outlined. Originality/value - Proposes a new way of thinking which will affect future military planning. A cybernetic/systemic methodology provides solutions.

We investigated the acceptability of a pre-ordering website for a workplace canteen that prompts customers to swap to lower-energy swaps and the factors influencing swap acceptance. Employees (n = 30) placed a hypothetical lunch order through a pre-ordering website designed for their canteen while thinking aloud. Semi-structured interview questions supported data collection. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Acceptability was generally high, but potentially context dependent. Practical considerations, such as reminders to pre-order, user-friendliness, provision of images of menu items and energy information while browsing, an ability to reserve pre-ordered meals, and a swift collection service facilitated acceptability. The restrictive timeframe within which orders could be placed, a lack of opportunity to see foods before ordering, and prompts to swap being perceived as threatening autonomy were barriers to acceptability. Swap acceptance was facilitated by the provision of physical activity calorie equivalents (PACE) information, and swap similarity in terms of taste, texture, and expected satiety as well as the perception that alternatives provided meaningful energy savings. Online canteen pre-ordering systems that prompt lower-energy swaps may be an acceptable approach to help reduce energy intake in the workplace.

A case study of participant information leaflets of randomized placebo-controlled trials of acupuncture	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Placebo; Participant information leaflet; Informed consent; Information disclosure; Randomized controlled trial; Blinding; Outcome	CLINICAL-TRIALS; CONSENT; ETHICS; NOCEBO; EXPECTATIONS; EFFICACY; IMPACT; NEEDLE; PAIN	Background: While full disclosure of information on placebo control in participant information leaflets (PILs) in a clinical trial is ethically required during informed consent, there have been concerning voices such complete disclosures may increase unnecessary nocebo responses, breach double-blind designs, and/or affect direction of trial outcomes. Taking an example of acupuncture studies, we aimed to examine what participants are told about placebo controls in randomized, placebo-controlled trials, and how it may affect blinding and trial outcomes. Methods: Authors of published randomized, placebo-controlled trials of acupuncture were identified from PubMed search and invited to provide PILs for their trials. The collected PILs were subjected to content analysis and categorized based on degree of information disclosure on placebo. Blinding index (BI) as a chance-corrected measurement of blinding was calculated and its association with different information disclosure was examined. The impact of different information disclosure from PILs on primary outcomes was estimated using a random effects model. Results: In 65 collected PILs, approximately 57% of trials fully informed the participants of placebo control, i.e. full disclosure, while the rest gave deceitful or no information on placebo, i.e. no disclosure. Placebo groups in the studies with no disclosure tended to make more opposite guesses on the type of received intervention than those with disclosure, which may reflect wishful thinking (BI -0.21 vs. -0.16; p=0.38). In outcome analysis, studies with no disclosure significantly favored acupuncture than those with full disclosure (standardized mean difference -0.43 vs. -0.12; p=0.03), probably due to enhanced expectations. Conclusions: How participants are told about placebos can be another potential factor that may influence participant blinding and study outcomes by possibly modulating patient expectation. As we have few empirical findings on this issue, future studies are needed to determine whether the present findings are relevant to other medical disciplines and at the same time a routine practice of fully disclosing placebo information in PILs calls for reevaluation.

J	Kleinberg, J				Kleinberg, Jon			Analysis of large-scale social and information networks	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						social networks; Web systems; graph theory	ORGANIZATION	The growth of the Web has required us to think about the design of information systems in which large-scale computational and social feedback effects are simultaneously at work. At the same time, the data generated by Web-scale systems-recording the ways in which millions of participants create content, link information, form groups and communicate with one another-have made it possible to evaluate long-standing theories of social interaction, and to formulate new theories based on what we observe. These developments have created a new level of interaction between computing and the social sciences, enriching the perspectives of both of these disciplines. We discuss some of the observations, theories and conclusions that have grown from the study of Web-scale social interaction, focusing on issues including the mechanisms by which people join groups, the ways in which different groups are linked together in social networks and the interplay of positive and negative interactions in these networks.

J	Lyu, X; Li, ZZ; Ma, Q; She, MR				Lyu, Xi; Li, Zhizhong; Ma, Quan; She, Manrong			Effects of accessible information amount and judgment times on human diagnostic performance of nuclear power plant faults	ERGONOMICS			English	Article						Diagnosis; information amount; process performance; information processing strategy	PROBABILITY JUDGMENT; INPUT OVERLOAD; ACCURACY	Information is key to the process of diagnosis, so it is necessary to understand how information amount may influence human performance. The current study investigated this issue through an experiment where participants diagnosed an accident in a simulated nuclear power plant. The amount of accessible information and the times of making judgments were manipulated. The results showed that increasing the amount of accessible information led the participants to seek more and think shallower, and thus decreased diagnostic accuracies, whereas no significant effects were found for multiple judgement times. The authors argue that the disadvantages of more accessible information could be attributed not simply to 'information overload', but partly to the diagnosticians' unwise choice of information processing strategies. The findings imply that system designers should restrain the ever-growing amount of information while users should make more efficient use of information rather than take in more. Practitioner summary: Current research on diagnosis by humans was mostly limited to outcome performance. This study empirically investigated factors influencing its detailed process. The results showed that increasing accessible information amount impaired both process and outcome performances.

However, few engage directly with diverse stakeholders, an important goal in transformational education, through traditional curricula. We present the results following analysis of a course designed to provide graduate students with an immersion-based experience focused on the flow of information between science, advocacy, policymaking, and management as they relate to invasive species, an important driver of global change threatening many facets of the human condition. In this course students constructed a conceptual model of these interactions. Then, in an immersive experience, they directly engaged with a diverse group of stakeholders, including government agency officials, policymakers, and land managers. Finally, to drive transformational learning, students were challenged to refine the conceptual model and develop a revised framework that more accurately reflected the true co-production (transdisciplinary) nature of these interactions. Thematic analysis of student perceptions revealed a shift from a science-centric view to one where science was but one of many inputs responsible for shaping invasive species policy. This immersive approach, founded in face-to-face interactions among diverse stakeholders, represented a transformative shift in student thinking toward the importance of co-management and collaboration in addressing invasive species.

The growing number of students enrolled in entrepreneurship programs creates unprecedented challenges on educators. Although multiple teaching and learning activities are adopted in entrepreneurship education, these are mainly carried out using traditional classroom lectures, case studies and group discussions. Nowadays, information & communication technology (ICT) is used to enhance the effectiveness of traditional teaching methods and competency training. PowToon is a web-based ICT tool that hat allows teachers and students to quickly and easily create animated presentations. Using quasi-experimental design and qualitative method, this study is to examine whether PowToon is an effective tool for business plan presentation. The study find that the animated presentations attracted more investment than the groups that did not prepare animated videos. It reflects that developed videos which helps entrepreneurial team to better deliver their business ideas to investors in a well-thought out way. In addition, the results of the study show that individuals who generate a business idea did not necessarily significantly influence their investment decisions. Our findings challenge the concept on self-biases evaluations of the economic potential of their own business ideas. Finally, the students were very willing to adopt new ways of delivering their business ideas.

The goals of this study were to describe critical think-ing disposition among newly graduated nurses and to examine the factors that impact the development of critical thinking disposition. Method: This study em-ployed a cross-sectional research design. Results: The mean critical thinking score was 244.11 (SD = 44.70), with the highest mean scores earned on the inquisitive-ness subscale (M = 38.46, SD = 7.10). The lowest subscale scores were for systematicity (M = 34.81, SD = 5.54), truth seeking (M = 33.12, SD = 6.42), and self-confidence (M = 29.26, SD = 6.90). Critical thinking dispositions were significantly associated with teaching strategies during the educational period, problem-based learn-ing courses, and length of exposure to problem-based learning. Conclusion: Findings provide information to understand the disposition toward critical thinking in novice nurses and can serve as a reference in efforts to improve novice nurses' critical thinking skills.

The kinematics-based and dynamics-based sideslip angle estimators are designed for sideslip angle estimation. Also, considering the influence of ill-conditioned matrix and model uncertainty, a novel sideslip angle estimator is proposed based on the wheel speed coupling relationship using a modified recursive least squares algorithm. In order to integrate the advantages of above three sideslip angle estimators, drawing lessons from the multisensory information fusion technology, a novel thinking of sideslip angle estimator design is presented through information fusion of pseudo-multi-sensors. Simulations and experiments were carried out, and effectiveness of the proposed estimation method was verified.

Increasingly, however, providers are required to think beyond service quality and develop a deeper understanding of their customers' Quality of Experience (QoE). Although models exist that assess the QoE of Web Application, significant challenges remain in: (1) Defining QoE factors from a Web engineering perspective, (2) quantifying the relationship between so-called "objective" and "subjective" factors of relevance, and (3) dealing with limited data available in relation to subjective factors. In response, the work here presents a novel model (and associated software instantiation) that integrates factors through Key Performance Indicators and Key Quality Indicators. The mapping is incorporated into a correlation model that assesses the QoE of Web Applications, with a consideration of defining the factors in term of quality requirements derived from web architecture. The data resulting from the mapping is used as input of the proposed model to develop artefacts that quantify and predict QoE using Machine Learning. The development of proposed model is framed and guided by Design Science Research approach with the purpose of enabling providers to more informed decisions regarding QoE and/or to optimise resources accordingly. Although the work is oriented at developing an artefact that has clear utility for practice, the nascent design theory underpinning the work is developed and discussed.

J	Noguchi, S; Wang, H; Inoue, J				Noguchi, Satoshi; Wang, Hui; Inoue, Junya			Identification of microstructures critically affecting material properties using machine learning framework based on metallurgists' thinking process	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HIGH-CONTRAST COMPOSITES; LINKAGES	In materials science, machine learning has been intensively researched and used in various applications. However, it is still far from achieving intelligence comparable to that of human experts in terms of creativity and explainability. In this paper, we investigate whether machine learning can acquire explainable knowledge without directly introducing problem-specific information such as explicit physical mechanisms. In particular, a potential of machine learning to obtain the capability to identify a part of material structures that critically affects a physical property without human prior knowledge is mainly discussed. The guide for constructing the machine learning framework adopted in this paper is to imitate human researchers' process of thinking in the interpretation and development of materials. Our framework was applied to the optimization of structures of artificial dual-phase steels in terms of a fracture property. A comparison of results of the framework with those of numerical simulation based on governing physical laws demonstrated the potential of our framework for the identification of a part of microstructures critically affecting the target property. Consequently, this implies that our framework can implicitly acquire an intuition in a similar way that human researchers empirically attain the general strategy for material design consistent with the physical background.

J	Zhou, XJ; Jiang, T				Zhou, Xiao Jian; Jiang, Ting			Enhancing Least Square Support Vector Regression with Gradient Information	NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Least square support vector regression; Machine learning; Gradient information	AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIATION; DESIGN; OUTPUT	Traditional methods of constructing of least square support vector regression (LSSVR) do not consider the gradients of the true function but just think about the exact responses at samples. If gradient information is easy to get, it should be used to enhance the surrogate. In this paper, the gradient-enhanced least square support vector regression (GELSSVR) is developed with a direct formulation by incorporating gradient information into the traditional LSSVR. The efficiencies of this technique are compared by analytical function fitting and two real life problems (the recent U.S. actuarial life table and Borehole). The results show that GELSSVR provides more reliable prediction results than LSSVR alone.

J	Snyder, J				Snyder, Jaime			Visual Representation of Information as Communicative Practice	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						collaboration; visual materials; human communications	PARTICIPATION; LIFE	Anyone who has clarified a thought or prompted a response during a conversation by drawing a picture has exploited the potential of image making to convey information. Images are increasingly ubiquitous in daily communication due to advances in visually enabled information and communication technologies (ICT), such as information visualization applications, image retrieval systems, and virtual collaborative work tools. Although images are often used in social contexts, information science research concerned with the visual representation of information typically focuses on the image artifact and system building. To learn more about image making as a form of social interaction and as a form of information practice, a qualitative study examined face-to-face conversations involving the creation of ad hoc visualizations (i.e., napkin drawings). Interactional sociolinguistic concepts of conversational involvement and coordination guided multimodal analysis of video-recorded interactions that included spontaneous drawing. Findings show patterns in communicative activities associated with the visual representation of information. Furthermore, the activity of mark making contributes to the maintenance of conversational involvement in ways that are not always evident in the drawn artifact. This research has implications for the design and evaluation of visually enabled virtual collaboration environments, visual information extraction and retrieval systems, and data visualization tools.

In a study based on individual interviews with N = 134 students aged 14-18 years, who visited the Deutsches Museum in Munich, Germany, we collected data on the students' socialization in information and communication technology (ICT), on their self-rated ICT competence, their working knowledge of ICT professions, and their reaction to sexist statements. To analyze more in depth, we provided the participants with two alternative forms of vocational counseling interventions designed to modify their ICT-related attitudes (information vs. robotics condition). Analyses of variance and multiple linear regressions were administered to the data. Results: The girls in this study were socialized more than one year after the boys in using computers. While the boys received their ICT training mostly through their fathers and peers, the girls frequently had to rely on their teachers for ICT instruction. The girls rate their ICT competence lower than the boys; nevertheless, both genders share a relatively high interest in ICT professions. What's more, the girls are less convinced that men have a natural talent for computer science. Openness toward taking up jobs in the ICT industry in the case of the boys is less determined by their self-rated computer competence and the perceived ICT talent assessment by their parents. In both intervention conditions, they eagerly received and processed the new information provided. The girls' interest in an ICT career largely depends on preconditions, namely on their self-rated ICT competence, on a long-standing enthusiasm for computers, and on what they perceive their parents think about their ICT talents. Unlike the more pragmatic approach of the boys, their self-doubts, especially among the academic high school girls brings about that they are still in danger to leave the field of information/computer science before having entered it. In general, the participants' responses point to a comprehensive misdirection of young women in German middle schools and academic high schools. Fortunately, this study provides a lot of evidence on how to fix this major mishap in the interest of both sexes.

For passenger train operators, modernization projects provide key opportunities to improve the environmental impact of their rolling stock by making informed design decisions at the midpoint of the life cycle of their trains. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is widely adopted as the main instrument for evaluating environmental impact. However, in the past LCA was rarely used in the earlier design stages, where it is most effective, due to constrained access to data, information, and LCA-specific expertise. To this end, a purpose-built streamlined LCA tool for train modernization is developed and demonstrated, following a Design Science Research approach. The developed tool simplifies the application of LCA employing four main design principles: (1) sacrificing the declarative function of LCA, (2) the use of Input-Output-based Life Cycle Inventory, (3) the inclusion of 'shadow costs', (4) the limitation of the included environmental impact categories. By streamlining the application of LCA in this way, it becomes possible to introduce LCA-based principles and ways of thinking into a process that would otherwise be inaccessible to performing LCA in: the early design stages of modernization projects.

J	Taye, G				Taye, Girma			Improving health care services through enhanced Health Information System: Human capacity development Model	ETHIOPIAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Human Capacity Development Model; Health Information Systems; Quality of health care; data quality; Information use		Background: Quality of health care depends on how the health system is able to reduce errors through evidence-based decisions. Demand for data on patient care has increased over the years to improve the health care system, including planning and policy issues in several countries across the globe. However, there are challenges and opportunities in the process of recording, managing, analyzing, interpreting, and reporting data and/or information. Accordingly, several studies showed that an appropriate capacity development program is expected to improve data recording, data quality and use by professionals, planners, policymakers, and stakeholders. Objective: This project aims to assess existing capacity-building efforts and formulate a new and better capacity-building model for the lower-level health facility staff of Addis ababa City administration, 2018-2020. Methods: PRISM and SWOT analysis method were employed to assess existing HIS gaps and opportunities. The assessment was carried out in the health centers located in selected three sub-cities of Addis Ababa City Administration. We employed phase to phase approach to design an innovative human capacity development model, namely, desk review, data collection, data synthesis, design, and validation. Results: The project designed interventions that were implemented simultaneously and one supporting the other. The capacity-building model includes a renewed approach to training; structured mentorship approach; practically oriented supportive supervision; 'experience sharing program' for helping those in a poor environment gain experience through experience sharing; quality improvement initiatives; and implementation science studies to tackle problems that may not be solved with activities listed earlier. Conclusion and recommendation: The new capacity-building approach helped to improve individual knowledge, interpersonal relationship, strategic thinking, system management, and accountability, all of which lead to sustained and improved HIS. Improvement in HIS is often a collective effort of several forces, but the human element plays a decisive role.

Although this theory is one of the dominant models of sensemaking, it has not been extensively tested with a range of sensemaking tasks. The tasks discussed here focused on making sense of structures rather than processes or narratives. Eleven researchers were asked to construct understanding of how a scientific community in a particular domain is organized (e.g., people, relationships, contributions, factors) by exploring the concept of influence in academia. This topic was chosen because, although researchers frequently handle this type of task, it is unlikely that they have explicitly sought this type of information. We conducted a think-aloud study and semistructured interviews with junior and senior researchers from the human-computer interaction (HCI) domain, asking them to identify current leaders and rising stars in both HCI and chemistry. Data were coded and analyzed using the Data/Frame Model to both test and extend the model. Three themes emerged from the analysis: novices and experts' sensemaking activity chains, constructing frames through indicators, and characteristics of structure tasks. We propose extensions to the Data/Frame Model to accommodate structure sensemaking.

This is important to achieve a competitive advantage in an unpredictable and ever-changing environment. However, the key enablers of such resilient and sustainable supply chain management are less explored in construction projects. Therefore, the present research aims to determine the causality among the crucial drivers of resilient and sustainable supply chain management (RSSCM) in construction projects. Based on the literature review, 12 enablers of RSSCM were shortlisted. Using the systems thinking (ST) approach, this article portrays the interrelation between the 12 shortlisted resilience enablers crucial for sustainability in construction projects. The causality and interrelationships among identified enablers in the developed causal loop diagram (CLD) show their dynamic interactions and impacts within the RSSCM system. Based on the results of this study, agility, information sharing, strategic risk planning, corporate social responsibility, and visibility are the key enablers for the RSSCM. The findings of this research will enable the construction managers to compare different SCs while understanding how supply chain characteristics increase or decrease the durability and ultimately affect the exposure to risk in the construction SCs.

Experimental treatments on networks may spread. Randomizing assignment of treatment to nodes enhances learning about the counterfactual causal effects of a social network experiment and also requires new methodology (ex. Aronow and Samii, 2017a; Bowers et al., 2013; Toulis and Kao, 2013). In this paper we show that the way in which a treatment propagates across a social network affects the statistical power of an experimental design. As such, prior information regarding treatment propagation should be incorporated into the experimental design. Our findings justify reconsideration of standard practice in circumstances where units are presumed to be independent even in simple experiments: information about treatment effects is not maximized when we assign half the units to treatment and half to control. We also present an example in which statistical power depends on the extent to which the network degree of nodes is correlated with treatment assignment probability. We recommend that researchers think carefully about the underlying treatment propagation model motivating their study in designing an experiment on a network. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Design: Meta-analysis was performed to obtain summary conclusions on the influence of PBL on nursing students' learning outcomes. Data sources: Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies from the period between database inception and March 3, 2022. Review methods: A random-effects model was used to generate pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) for critical thinking, problem-solving, and self-confidence. The heterogeneity of each variable in the pooled estimate was determined using a random-effects model. Results: Overall, PBL had a greater positive effect than traditional learning on critical thinking (SMD: 0.44; 95 % CI: 0.14-0.73), analysis (SMD: 0.72; 95 % CI: 0.84-1.25), and evaluation (SMD: 0.33; 95 % CI: 0.05-0.61). However, the impact of PBL on problem-solving and self-confidence need further investigation. Conclusions: PBL appears to improve nursing students' critical thinking skills, especially their ability to analyze and evaluate. The findings of this study may be used as evidence of PBL being a more effective method than traditional/conventional learning techniques for increasing students' critical thinking.

Previous work has shown that doctors use inductive reasoning to progress from facts to hypotheses and deductive reasoning to move from hypotheses to the gathering of confirmatory information. No individual assessment method has been designed to quantify the use of inductive and deductive procedures within clinical reasoning. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility and reliability of a new method which allows for the rapid identification of the style (inductive or deductive) of clinical reasoning in medical students and experts. Methods The study included four groups of four participants. These comprised groups of medical students in Years 3, 4 and 5 and a group of specialists in internal medicine, all at a medical school with a 6-year curriculum in France. Participants were asked to solve four clinical problems by thinking aloud. The thinking expressed aloud was immediately transcribed into concept maps by one or two 'writers' trained to distinguish inductive and deductive links. Reliability was assessed by estimating the inter-writer correlation. The calculated rate of inductive reasoning, the richness score and the rate of exhaustiveness of reasoning were compared according to the level of expertise of the individual and the type of clinical problem. Results The total number of maps drawn amounted to 32 for students in Year 4, 32 for students in Year 5, 16 for students in Year 3 and 16 for experts. A positive correlation was found between writers (R = 0.66-0.93). Richness scores and rates of exhaustiveness of reasoning did not differ according to expertise level. The rate of inductive reasoning varied as expected according to the nature of the clinical problem and was lower in experts (41% versus 67%). Conclusions This new method showed good reliability and may be a promising tool for the assessment of medical problem-solving skills, giving teachers a means of diagnosing how their students think when they are confronted with clinical problems.

On the other hand, researchers in some fields have focused on cognitive biases and their interventions in thinking and information processing. In this article, by bridging between these two issues, i.e., scientific research mistakes and cognitive bias, it will be first shown that scientific research requires scientists' choices in various stages such as subject selection, data treatment, theory determination, and technological design. Then, we show the involvement of choice-supportive bias in scientific inquiry as one of the potential cognitive limitations of science. Finally, three ways are discussed to mitigate the effects of this bias in science: more scores to self-criticism publications, recording of the shortcomings of the research by the researcher before publishing, and emphasizing control processes before researcher choices in scientific inquiry.

J	Fu, Y; Zhang, DL; Jiang, H				Fu, Yu; Zhang, Dongliang; Jiang, Hao			Students' Attitudes and Competences in Modeling Using 3D Cartoon Toy Design Maker	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						3D cartoon toy design; students' attitude; design maker competence	TECHNOLOGY; EDUCATION	With the rapid development of education and information technology, there has been an increasing focus on maker education, which emphasizes cultivating students' creative thinking and problem-solving ability. This paper presents our efforts to create a 3D cartoon toy design curriculum system that offers a playful and collaborative way to engage students with creation-based learning. It consists of a 3D modeling software and a series of 3D cartoon toy design courses. The former was developed according to students' cognitive characteristics and hands-on operation habits, and the toy design courses include activities such as hand-painting, computer modeling, pattern design, handcraft, and creative display. This 3D cartoon toy design course was preliminarily implemented in one kindergarten and two primary schools in Hangzhou, an eastern city in mainland China. A learning assessment of participating students was conducted upon completion of the course. Results show that (1) the initial attitudes of junior students towards learning 3D cartoon toy design were mainly influenced by their interests, whereas senior students paid more attention to turning their ideas into reality with the help of technical tools. (2) All students were highly successful at mastering foundational modeling concepts, but the junior students were less successful at mastering abstract modeling concepts. (3) The course was most successful in developing students' collaborative ability and content creation. (4) Additionally, teachers were successful at promoting a collaborative and communicative environment. Findings are discussed.

Soils, Science and Community ActioN (SoilSCAN): a citizen science tool to empower community-led land management change in East Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						soils; citizen science; soil erosion; Tanzania; agritech; resilience; community participation	ORGANIC-CARBON; SPECTROSCOPY; KNOWLEDGE	Pastoralist communities worldwide face complex challenges regarding food and feed productivity. Primary production systems are under stress, nutritional choices are changing and the relationship between development and agriculture is undergoing profound transformation. Under increasing pressure from climate and land use change, East African agro-pastoral systems are approaching a tipping point in terms of land degradation. There is an urgent need for evidence-led sustainable land management interventions to reverse degradation of natural resources that support food and water security. A key barrier, however, is a lack of high spatial resolution soil health data wherein collecting such information for each individual community is beyond their means. In this context, we tested whether bridging such data gaps could be achieved through a coordinated programme at the boundary between participation and citizen science. Key outputs included a community-led trial of a hand-held soil scanner, which highlighted a range of positive benefits and practical challenges in using this technology in this context, with identification of some potential solutions; and a targeted soil organic matter and nutrient status dataset in a small catchment-based community setting. The results show that if the practical challenges can be resolved, use of portable soil scanner technology has the potential to fill key knowledge gaps and thereby improve resilience to the threat of land degradation through locally responsive farmer and community decision-making.

Karin Knorr Cetina's theory of epistemic cultures was utilised as the theoretical lens. The findings indicate that the user is not a given; instead, the user is a constructed phenomenon in design. The design process is characterised by the deconstruction and reconstruction of the user information and of experiential information, implemented to meet the epistemic needs of designers. User representations are used as the liminal knowledge. Designers manipulated this knowledge in order to narrow down the artefact to be designed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thus, in addition to a powerful Pre-trained Language Model (PrLM) as an encoder, multi-choice MRC especially relies on a matching network design that is supposed to effectively capture the relationships among the triplet of passage, question, and answers. While the newer and more powerful PrLMs have shown their strengths even without the support from a matching network, we propose a new DUal Multi-head Co-Attention (DUMA) model. It is inspired by the human transposition thinking process solving the multi-choice MRC problem by considering each other's focus from the standpoint of passage and question. The proposed DUMA has been shown to be effective and is capable of generally promoting PrLMs. Our proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark multi-choice MRC tasks, DREAM, and RACE. Our results show that in terms of powerful PrLMs, DUMA can further boost the models to obtain higher performance.

Designing computer-based tests: design guidelines from multimedia learning studied with eye tracking	INSTRUCTIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Computer-based testing; Eye tracking; Mental effort; Multimedia learning; Design	COGNITIVE-LOAD; MOVEMENTS; ARCHITECTURE; INFORMATION; STUDENTS	The use of computer-based tests (CBTs), for both formative and summative purposes, has greatly increased over the past years. One major advantage of CBTs is the easy integration of multimedia. It is unclear, though, how to design such CBT environments with multimedia. The purpose of the current study was to examine whether guidelines for designing multimedia instruction based on the Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) will yield similar effects in CBT. In a within-subject design, thirty-three vocational students completed a computer-based arithmetic exam, in which half of the items were presented in an original design format, and the other half was redesigned based on the CTML principles for instructional design (i.e., adapted format). Results showed that applying CTML principles to a CBT decreased the difficulty of the test items, i.e., students scored significantly higher on the adapted test items. Moreover, eye-tracking data showed that the adapted items required less visual search and increased attention for the question and answer. Finally, cognitive load, measured as silent pauses during a secondary think-aloud task, decreased. Mean fixation duration (a different indicator of cognitive load), however, did not significantly differ between adapted and original items. These results indicate that applying multimedia principles to CBTs can be beneficial. It seems to prevent cognitive overload and helps students to focus on important parts of the test items (e.g., the question), leading to better test results.	[Dirkx, K. J.

J	Wang, LY; Wang, SJ; Keller, LR; Li, J				Wang, Liangyan; Wang, Shijian; Keller, L. Robin; Li, Jie			Thinking styles affect reactions to brand crisis apologies	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING			English	Article						Brand management; Customer behavior	CONSTRUAL-LEVEL; MODERATING ROLE; CULTURAL-DIFFERENCES; SELF-EFFICACY; MESSAGE; ADOLESCENTS; PERCEPTIONS; PUBLICITY; RESPONSES; DISTANCE	Purpose - This article aims to examine how a person's thinking style, specifically holistic versus analytic, and a firm's crisis apology with the remedial solution framed in "why" (vs "how") terms can interactively impact consumers' perceived efficacy of the firm to respond to the crisis and their impression or evaluation of the brand. Design/methodology/approach - Hypotheses were tested through three experimental studies involving 308 participants recruited in China. Participants answered survey questions investigating the interactive effects from consumers' thinking style (culture as a proxy in Study 1, measured in Study 2 or primed in Study 3) and a brand's crisis apology with the remedial solution framed in "why" (vs "how") terms on consumers' perceived efficacy and evaluation of the firm. Findings - The frame of the remedial solution resulting in a higher evaluation improvement depended on a consumer's thinking style. For holistic thinkers, a "why" (vs "how") framed remedial solution resulted in a higher evaluation improvement; however, for analytic thinkers, a "how" (vs "why") framed remedial solution resulted in a higher evaluation improvement. Additionally, the results showed that a consumer's perceived efficacy of the brand being able to successfully respond to the crisis mediated the interactive effects of the remedial solution framing and thinking styles on the evaluation improvement. Practical Implications - The findings provide evidence that framing of the remedial solution can be leveraged as a tool to reduce negative impact resulting from a brand crisis. Specifically, the results suggest that companies may do well to employ a "why" framed remedial solution, particularly in cases where consumers are likely to process information holistically. Conversely, a "how" framed remedial solution may be effective in situations where consumers are likely to process information analytically. Originality/value - This research contributes to the literature, being among the first to consider how the remedial solution framing in a firm's apology can enhance people's evaluation of the brand and decrease the perceived negative impact resulting from the brand crisis.

To this end, a plugin was developed and implemented in a BIM-enabled visualization environment. This system aims to help a user decide the best design between alternatives, while considering the user's perspective on what generates value in the project. To illustrate and validate the usability and importance of the system, the design of a warehouse with specific requirements was considered. Four design alternatives were modeled considering different types of superstructures, building envelopes, and materials. The system imported an external database and calculated the general costs, CO2 emissions, and thermal comfort indicators for each model. It also incorporated user-defined weights for each indicator and graphically displayed the results indicating the best options through a multiple attribute decision method. From the obtained results, it was concluded that it is possible to integrate BIM and lean principles to support sustainable development in the construction industry. Through an experiment with warehouse alternatives, the proposed approach revealed that the best project could save nearly 50% of CO2 emissions when compared to the worst project and that the second-best project had the best performance in terms of thermal heat flow (1.80 Megawatts). The results also indicate that the system can be a great asset in supporting the decision-making process of selecting the best design alternative and understanding the impact of design changes on cost and on the environment.

The purpose of this paper was to evaluate a gamified model for disseminating production information in the construction industry using visual management. This was a qualitative exploratory study that employed the Design Science methodology and the Design Science Research method. The model was designed, developed, and evaluated by 35 people, including 10 off-site users who focused on usability, user experience, and model promotability, 15 engineers, and 10 workers who considered user experience and promotability. Employees and managers thought the model was excellent, while outside users thought it was good. Furthermore, the evaluators made suggestions for improvements aimed at achieving excellence. We conclude that the proposed model improves production information dissemination in construction by considering the target audience's digital inclusion and knowledge diffusion within work teams.

The impact and influence of traditional teaching method have information technology integrated modern instruction and science concept learning play an important role. Teaching methods promoted in guided discovery instruction are to cultivate learners' abilities of discovery, exploration, problem-solving and independent thinking, and creation and invention through discovery or creative learning. Students could actively and positively participate in learning and integrate and construct knowledge by themselves. In other words, all knowledge is individually operated and explained, rather than passively acquired. By applying quasi-experimental research with experimental design, 98 students in two classes in Fuzhou No. 1 Middle School and Affiliated High School of Fujian Normal University are preceded the 16-week (3hr per week) experimental teaching research. The research results reveal that 1. Guided discovery instruction would affect learning achievement, 2.guided discovery instruction would influence learning retention, and 3.learning achievement presents significantly positive effects on learning retention. Based on the research results, conclusions and suggestions are proposed at the end of this study, expecting to provide reference and improvement for teachers' teaching method.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING			English	Article						cancer screening; cervical cancer; informed decision making; risk communication; patient information	HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS HPV; ETHNIC-MINORITY WOMEN; RISK COMMUNICATION; KNOWLEDGE; NUMERACY; BENEFITS; DESIGN; FORMAT; HARMS; THINK	Background. Organized screening programs often rely on written materials to inform the public. In the United Kingdom, women invited for cervical cancer screening receive a leaflet from the National Health Service (NHS) to support screening decisions. However, information about screening may be too complex for people to understand, potentially hindering informed decision making. Objectives. We aimed to identify women's difficulties in interpreting the leaflet used in England and negative and positive responses to the leaflet. Methods. We used a sequential mixed-methods design involving 2 steps: cognitive think-aloud interviews (n = 20), followed by an England-wide survey (n = 602). Data were collected between June 2017 and December 2018, and participants included women aged 25 to 64 y with varying sociodemographics. Results. Interview results revealed misunderstandings concerning screening results, benefits, and additional tests and treatment, although participants tended to react positively to numerical information. Participants were often unfamiliar with the potential harms associated with screening (i.e., screening risks), key aspects of human papillomavirus, and complex terms (e.g., dyskaryosis). Survey results indicated that interpretation difficulties were common (M correct items = 12.5 of 23). Lower understanding was associated with lower educational level (beta's >0.15, P's <0.001), lower numeracy scores (beta = 0.36, P < 0.001), and nonwhite ethnicity (beta = 0.10, P = 0.007). The leaflet was evaluated positively overall. Conclusions. Despite previous user testing of the leaflet, key information may be too complex for some recipients. As a consequence, they may struggle to make informed decisions about screening participation based on the information provided. We discuss implications for the improvement of communications about screening and decision support.

A Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) in Biology: Developing Systems Thinking through Field Experiences in Restoration Ecology	CBE-LIFE SCIENCES EDUCATION			English	Article							DESIGN-BASED RESEARCH; EDUCATION; PROGRESS; CHOICE; CAREER	Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) introduce research leading to skills acquisition and increased persistence in the major. CUREs generate enthusiasm and interest in doing science and serve as an intervention to increase equity and participation of historically marginalized students. In the second-semester laboratory of our introductory sequence for biology and marine science majors at California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB), instructors updated and implemented a field-based CURE. The goals of the CURE were to promote increased scientific identity, systems thinking, and equity at a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI). Through the CURE, students engaged in scientific writing through a research paper with a focus on information literacy, critical thinking, and quantitative reasoning as important elements of thinking like a scientist. Course exams also revealed that students showed gains in their ability to evaluate a new biological system using systems thinking. More broadly, because such field-based experiences demonstrate equity gains among Latinx students and a much greater sense of scientific identity, they may have impacts beyond introductory biology including in students' personal and professional lives.

The lack of reliable health related information makes it difficult to develop effective health policies. In order to understand the organization of HIS in African countries, we undertook a literature review. Methods Our study was conducted using the PubMed and Scopus bibliographic search engines. The inclusion criteria were: (i) all articles published between 2005 and 2019, (ii) articles including in their title the keywords "health", "information", "systems", "system", "africa", "developing countries", "sante", "pays en developpement", "Afrique", (iii) articles that are written in English or French, (iv) which deals with organizational and technical issues about HIS in African countries. Results Fourteen retrieved articles out of 2492 were included in the study, of which 13 (92.9%) were qualitative. All of them dealt with issues related to HIS in 12 African countries. All 12 countries (100.0%) had opted for a data warehouse approach to improve their HIS. This approach, supported by the DHIS2 system, has enabled providing reliable data. However, 11 out of the 12 countries (92.0%) frameworks were aligned with funding donors' strategies and lacked any national strategy. Conclusion This study suggests that the lack of a national health information management strategy will always be a threat to HIS performance in African countries. Ideally, rigorous upstream thinking to strengthen HIS governance should be undertaken by defining and proposing a coherent conceptual framework to analyze and guide the development and integration of digital applications into HIS over the long term.

We included observational clinical studies reporting the serum levels INHB and AMH in girls with precocious puberty. Conference articles and observational study abstracts were included if they contained enough information regarding study design and outcome data. Case series and reports were excluded. An overall standard mean difference (SMD) between precocious puberty and healthy controls was estimated using a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model.ResultsA total of 11 studies featuring 552 girls with precocious puberty and 405 healthy girls were selected for analysis. The meta-analysis showed that the INHB level of precocious puberty [including central precocious puberty (CPP) and premature the larche (PT)] were significantly increased. While there was no significant association between precocious puberty [including CPP, PT, premature pubarche (PP) and premature adrenarche (PA)] and the level of serum AMH.ConclusionScientific evidence suggested that the INHB level, but not the AMH level, altered in girls with precocious puberty compared with healthy controls. Through our results we think that INHB level might be a marker for the auxiliary diagnosis of precocious puberty (especially CPP and PT). Therefore, it is important to evaluate and thoroughly investigate the clinical indicators (e.g., INHB) in order to ensure early diagnosis and medical intervention, and the risk of physical, psychological and social disorders in immature girls with precocious puberty is minimized.

The results show a positive influence of integration of DBL and PBL in reducing industry gaps with improved student performance, engagement, and learning through designed PBL activities. Background: For an engineering graduate analysis, design, thinking, and validation of complex systems interactions is a desirable skill to support sustainability goals. A restructuring in delivery of the course through interactive lecture time and more project-based activities can improve students' engagement, performance, and overall achievement in attaining desirable program learning outcomes (LOs). Intended Outcome: The objective is to provide student learning with an experience on how to apply critical thinking and creativity to specify, design, and validate software systems by focusing on challenges faced in the software industry. Application Design: Google classroom was used to conduct interactive class and tutorial sessions, design various PBL activities, exchange information, and work in teams. Throughout the semester, all learning and practice modules of the course were linked sequentially with intermediate milestones. Findings: The results show a positive outcome in helping students in attaining the knowledge, and understanding of both theoretical and practical concepts. These findings are based on academic results, PBL activities, and two anonymous surveys. The findings of statistical analysis suggest a positive influence of DBL and PBL in SE course to meet industry challenges, expectations, and overall course and program LOs.

For the present study, we designed, implemented, and evaluated an educational activity planned for fourth graders (9 to 10 years old) to explore concepts and conceptual fields that were historically important for the discovery of natural selection. Observation field notes and students' productions were used to analyze how the students explored the proposed activity. Additionally, an evaluation framework consisting of a test, the evaluation criteria, and the scoring process was applied in two fourth-grade classes (N = 44) to estimate elementary school students' LUENS before and after engaging in the activity. Our results show that our activity allowed students to link the key concepts, resulting in a significant increase of their understanding of natural selection. They also reveal that additional activities and minor fine-tuning of the present activity are required to further support students' learning about the concept of differential reproduction.

J	Ma, CH; Zhou, W				Ma, Chunhua; Zhou, Wei			Effects of unfolding case-based learning on academic achievement, critical thinking, and self-confidence in undergraduate nursing students learning health assessment skills	NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE			English	Article						Academic achievement; Critical thinking; Heath assessment; Physical examination; Self-confidence; Undergraduate nursing students; Unfolding case-based learning	SIMULATION; ABILITY; TECHNOLOGY	Aim: To determine whether using unfolding case-based learning for undergraduate nursing students learning health assessment skills enhanced academic achievement, critical thinking and self-confidence, in comparison to traditional learning methods.Background: Unfolding case-based learning is an effective strategy for nursing students to narrow the gap between classroom learning and clinical practice. Little is known about whether unfolding case-based learning can be applied effectively in learning health assessment skills for undergraduate nursing students in China.Methods: A quasi-experimental design was used in this study. One hundred and fifteen undergraduate nursing students were recruited using convenience sampling from a medical university in southern China. They were assigned to an intervention group (n = 54) receiving unfolding case-based learning of health assessment skills, or a control group (n = 61) using traditional learning methods based on students' choices. Learning outcomes were evaluated by students' academic achievement, critical thinking and self-confidence. Data for critical thinking and self-confidence were collected before and after using the teaching strategies.Results: The academic achievements of undergraduate nursing students in the intervention group were better than those in the control group. The total average scores of critical thinking (272.51 vs. 266.47) and selfconfidence (24.92 vs. 21.04) for nursing students in the intervention group were also higher than those in the control group after implementing teaching strategies. There were statistical differences in the theory test (P = 0.041), skill test (P = 0.013), critical thinking (P = 0.008) and self-confidence (P = 0.036) between the two groups. Additionally, the statistical significance of the scores for critical thinking (264.36 vs. 272.51, P < 0.001) and self-confidence (18.76 vs. 24.92, P < 0.001) before and after teaching strategies were also observed among participants in the intervention group, but not in the control group (P = 0.143, P = 0.738).Conclusions: Unfolding case-based learning may be effective and suitable for undergraduate nursing students learning health assessment skills. The findings of this study provide useful information to nursing teachers for the development of unfolding case-based learning when teaching other nursing skills to undergraduate nursing students.

The reported case study involved 47 students during a two-weeks intensive course on the topic of urban gardening. Observations were collected during three distinctive phases: the co-design phase, the creation of an open design, and the sharing of these design solutions on the online platform Instructables.com. The open sharing of local solutions triggered more global discussions, based on several types of feedback: from simple questions to reference to existing works and from suggestions to critiques. Also, some examples of re-appropriation of the designed solutions were reported. These feedbacks show the possibilities for students to have a global vision on their local solutions, confronting them with a wider and more diverse audience. The case study shows, on the other hand, the difficulty in keeping students engaged in this global discussion, considering how after a few weeks the online discussions dropped to an almost complete silence. It is also very difficult with such online platforms to follow the re-appropriation cycles, losing the possibility of exploring the new local context where the replication/modification of the designed product occurred. The course's focus on open design is interesting from both the design and educational points of view. It implies a deep change in the teaching approach and learning attitude of students, allowing unknown peers to take part in the design process and fostering a global discussion starting from unique and local solutions.

STUDY DESIGN Direct observation of what sources of information were used to answer patients' questions. A written questionnaire was administered before the observation period to elicit information about the number of questions expected during a half day of office visits and what sources of information would be used to answer them. POPULATION A random sample of 50 New Zealand family physicians. OUTCOMES MEASURED We noted the number of questions, the clinical topics, the medical discipline they involved, and sources used to answer the questions. RESULTS There was an 83% (50/60) response rate. Seventy-eight percent of the family physicians had computers available to them at the time of office visits. There were 122 questions asked and the family physicians overestimated the number of questions they thought they would be asked by 3-fold (7.2 vs 2.4; P = .0001). Books were the most common source of answers, followed by colleagues. Only 9 questions were not answered. Questions about treatment were the most common (39%), followed by diagnosis (33%). Family physicians who had spent fewer years in practice were more likely to have a computer. Only 6 questions were answered using a computerized source, 5 of which were simple questions. CONCLUSIONS Despite great expectations that computers will be used to solve the information needs of family physicians, this study demonstrated that, currently, family physicians rarely use electronic sources to gather clinical information. Further work is needed to make computerized information more accessible to family physicians and to accustom family physicians to using computers at the time of an office visit.

Yet, in spite of all the advances in toxicology that have helped us understand and even predict toxicity associated with industrial chemicals, fundamental scientific questions crucial to the development of safer chemicals are left unanswered. Alternative strategies, such as in silico toxicity predictions, are considered the next frontier in molecular design for reduced hazard; however, such strategies are still not sufficiently developed to meet existing needs. Design strategies need to incorporate information and data at the nexus of multiple disciplines. Critically, there is a need for the incorporation of toxicology into the design phase of the molecular design process. In this Feature, we discuss the current status and future challenges in molecular design for reduced hazard.

In this context pharmaceutical industry is utmost regulated industry as it is governed by authoritative regulatory bodies. "Quality could be planned and most of quality deficit arises in the way process is planned and developed'', this thought of well known quality expert Joseph Moses Juran gives foundation to the concept of quality by design (QbD). USFDA launched a pilot programme in 2005 to permit participating firms a prospect to submit chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) of NDA information representing application of QbD. Now USFDA is accelerating QbD drive by making warning to generic manufacturers from January 2013. QbD has its perspectives to contribute the drug design, development, and manufacture of high-quality drug products.

J	Hagen, DR; White, JK; Tidor, B				Hagen, David R.; White, Jacob K.; Tidor, Bruce			Convergence in parameters and predictions using computational experimental design	INTERFACE FOCUS			English	Article						systems biology; ordinary differential equation modelling; parameter uncertainty; Fisher information; optimal experimental design	SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY; SLOPPY MODELS; FEEDBACK-REGULATION; PATHWAY; EGF; UNCERTAINTY; DYNAMICS; ACTIVATION; COMPLEXITY	Typically, biological models fitted to experimental data suffer from significant parameter uncertainty, which can lead to inaccurate or uncertain predictions. One school of thought holds that accurate estimation of the true parameters of a biological system is inherently problematic. Recent work, however, suggests that optimal experimental design techniques can select sets of experiments whose members probe complementary aspects of a biochemical network that together can account for its full behaviour. Here, we implemented an experimental design approach for selecting sets of experiments that constrain parameter uncertainty. We demonstrated with a model of the epidermal growth factor-nerve growth factor pathway that, after synthetically performing a handful of optimal experiments, the uncertainty in all 48 parameters converged below 10 per cent. Furthermore, the fitted parameters converged to their true values with a small error consistent with the residual uncertainty. When untested experimental conditions were simulated with the fitted models, the predicted species concentrations converged to their true values with errors that were consistent with the residual uncertainty. This paper suggests that accurate parameter estimation is achievable with complementary experiments specifically designed for the task, and that the resulting parametrized models are capable of accurate predictions.

More than any other form of knowing, science represents concentrated, devoted study of a topic. Range science should provide the basis of public information and opinion that is converted, via the political process, into federal grazing policy.

J	Walton, G; Cleland, J				Walton, Geoff; Cleland, Jamie			Information literacy Empowerment or reproduction in practice? A discourse analysis approach	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Information literacy; Discourse analysis; E-learning; Information behaviour; Information practice; Practice architectures	WIKIPEDIA; BEHAVIOR	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a qualitative investigation into whether online textual postings, produced by undergraduate students as part of an undergraduate module, can demonstrate their information literacy (IL) capabilities as a discursive competence and socially enacted practice. It also asks whether these online postings embody power relations between students, tutors and librarians. Design/methodology/approach - Foucault's notion of discursive competence and the separate but complementary concept of practice architectures (specifically focussing on "sayings") devised by Lloyd were used as thematic lenses to categorise online discussion board postings from a formative online peer assessment exercise created for first-year UK undergraduate students. Online postings were the node of analysis used to identify patterns of language across online conversation. These postings were inductively analysed through manual content analysis. Subject's responses were initially categorised using open coding. Findings - Postings appeared to embody student's discursive competence and information practice in IL, especially their level of information discernment and what constituted a quality "reference" for an assignment. However, they also demonstrated that the notion of "references" (information artefacts such as a journal article) perform a certain function in reproducing the discursive practices of an academic discipline as an agreed construct between tutor, student and librarian. Practical implications - Students were engaged in the process of becoming good scholars by using appropriate online postings to create valid arguments through assessing other's work, but what they did not do was question received meanings regarding the quality of information they used as evidence. Far from exhibiting the desired outcome of critical thinking (a cornerstone of IL) students who appeared most articulate in discussion tended to emulate the "strong discourse" put forward by their tutors and librarians. Originality/value - This research uses practice architectures and discourse analysis to analyse students' IL capabilities and the context in which they are developed. An approach not employed hitherto. This has practical implications for the ways in which academics and librarians introduce students to the academic discourse of their discipline and the ways in which the production, communication and exchange of information in academic contexts is characterised.

J	Zhu, YM; Gao, T				Zhu, Yunming; Gao, Tong			Packaging Decorative Pattern Design Based on Genetic Algorithm	MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								The science, art, and technology of covering or protecting things for distribution, storing, selling, and usage are known as packaging. Decorative design is the process of applying color, line, texture, or pattern to an object. Decorative design can be used to complement a structural design, or it can simply be a piece of art. Designers not only have the necessary design knowledge and expertise but they should also have certain observation, inventiveness, and other conditions. When it comes to packaging materials, most businesses want their products to be unique and attractive. The inventive design has entirely relied on people's thinking, and there is no technology or approach that can substitute human creative thinking. A genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic motivated by natural selection that relates to the wider family of evolutionary algorithms (EA) in computer science and operations research. Therefore, this paper first introduces the theoretical basis of genetic algorithms and then describes the generation process of packaging decorative patterns. Following the generation of the first population by coding the control points of the initial design line, the genetic algorithm is used to perform genetic operations on it in order to obtain multiple design solutions. The study found that this approach can alter the basic design scheme and provides an efficient way for the inventive creation of packaging decorative patterns, assisting designers in improving design efficiency and developing design ideas.

Design: A survey of an urban adult population. The questions were adopted from the Pan-European Union (EU) Survey of Consumer Attitudes to Food, Nutrition and Health (1995-1996). Setting: Lviv city, Ukraine. Subjects: The survey included 296 adults (84 males, 212 females) aged 18-55 years; they were primarily college students and subjects with tertiary education - the groups most likely to be both interested in healthy eating and affected by current socioeconomic downturns. Results: The major factors in food choice were: 'quality/freshness' (cited by 80%), 'price' (58%) and 'taste' (47%); only 34% cited 'trying to eat healthily'. More older people cited 'price' than 'quality/freshness', and men were more likely than women to cite 'taste'. Sources of healthy eating information included: 'relatives/friends' (cited by 65%, trusted by 85%) and health professionals (trusted by 92%, but used by only 35%); while advertising was the least trusted source (cited by 28%). Fifty-three per cent of respondents considered their diet to be healthy enough without further changes; 50% thought of the nutritional aspects of the food they ate; fewer women than men considered their diet healthy, and more women than men thought about nutrition. Barriers to healthy eating included: 'cost' (cited by 65%), 'lack of time' (55%), 'self-control' (54%), 'selection influences' (41%), 'lack of knowledge' (32%), 'unpleasant foods' and 'resistance to change' (both 30%). Conclusions: Strategies to encourage healthy eating in this population should involve word-of-mouth nutrition education concerning low-cost healthy alternatives.

J	Tubic, S; Cvetanovic, M; Radivojevic, Z; Stojanovic, S				Tubic, Stefan; Cvetanovic, Milos; Radivojevic, Zaharije; Stojanovic, Sasa			Annotated functional decomposition	COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						computational thinking; functional decomposition; information system; system design; UML		Experiences gained from the domain-specific courses showed that students focus mostly on how to implement solutions and less on what must be considered within the solution. In the case of information systems-related courses, students focus on system development using specific languages and frameworks while often disregard the required logical checks and constraints. This paper introduces annotated functional decomposition (AFD) to assist students in overcoming the challenge of understanding the logic of an information system. AFD leverages methodological concepts from computational thinking and represents a problem decomposition approach that is extended with additional levels of decomposition. These levels of decomposition are orthogonal and implemented with annotations that enrich a decomposition with information regarding control and data flow, as well as reuse and implementation details. AFD could be exercised with a supporting AFD Tool developed as an Eclipse IDE plugin that performs syntax and semantic checks along with the generation of UML sequential diagrams. The AFD Tool and its source code are available free of charge. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of AFD Tool usage during an information systems course revealed that students who used AFD achieved higher average grades than those who used UML for solving the same problems, and moreover that students perceived AFD as easy to understand and use.

J	Davis, RO; Park, T; Vincent, J				Davis, Robert O.; Park, Taejung; Vincent, Joseph			A Meta-Analytic Review on Embodied Pedagogical Agent Design and Testing Formats	JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING RESEARCH			English	Review						pedagogical agent; agent embodiment; agent design; testing format	COGNITIVE LOAD; INSTRUCTIONAL ANIMATION; CONVERSATIONAL AGENTS; LEARNING OUTCOMES; MULTIMEDIA; MOTIVATION; SCIENCE; MEMORY; ENVIRONMENTS; PERFORMANCE	Over the past decade, meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate the impact of embodied pedagogical agents on learning outcomes. Most review studies have evaluated learning outcomes from the perspective of testing labels such as transfer, retention, recognition, free recall, and various other classifications. This is problematic, because studies can be excluded due to the labeling of the assessment, even though the testing format and test taking strategy are the same. This meta-analysis assesses how embodied pedagogical agents impact learning when measured from the testing format and test taking strategy perspective. The new approach, along with new moderating variables to evaluate agent design and content information, supports previous findings that embodied pedagogical agents significantly increase learning; but there are limitations depending on the agent's design and the type of information being learned. This meta-analysis advances the field by exploring new ways to think about design elements associated with embodied pedagogical agents.

This paper aimed to explore how the interactive strategies of unplugged programming affect CT skills and SE. The study was conducted based on a quasi-experimental research method. The sample was composed of 104 sixth-grade students from northern China. The students in the experimental group learned with interactive unplugged programming, whereas those in the control group learned with non-interactive unplugged programming. Analysis of Covariance statistics and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling were adopted for data analysis. Results showed that the performance of the experimental group in CT skills and SE was considerably better than that of the control group. Moreover, the predictive relationships were more complex between CT skills and SE in the experimental group. In general, these findings confirmed the teaching value of interactive unplugged programming, and further emphasized the important role of students' CT skills in programming engagement. Therefore, through the application of interaction in instruction design, each student can be assigned a positive role to create a programming classroom that is more conducive to students.

J	Chu, FF; Li, WT				Chu, Fufeng; Li, Wentao			Data-Driven Image Interaction-Based Software Infrastructure for Graphic Design Research and Implementation	SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING			English	Article								This article constructs and studies a graphic design software model based on data-driven image interactions. The semantic information of image interaction is integrated into the framework of the augmented reality label placement algorithm. A new feature map, Guidance Map, is proposed to combine image saliency information with semantic information in the task scenario, accurately describing the importance of different regions in the user's field of view to derive a more reasonable label placement strategy. This database is different from other label placement algorithms that only use data-driven saliency detection. This paper proposes a data-driven augmented reality labeling method, which first presents the design requirements for augmented reality scene labeling placement, then designs the energy function for augmented reality scene characteristics, transforms the labeling placement problem into an optimization problem, and solves it. This paper proposes a feature representation form oriented to pixels, elements, interelement relationships, planes, and applications and quantifies the geometric features, perceptual features, and stylistic features in them. The model can fit the probability density distribution of the parts to predict the optimal element placement and element color under the target conditions.

We propose, in this paper, a centralized Information multiagent system to help actors of technological watch cells (called CIMASTEWA). This system is an extension of a previous distributed multiagent system and is set-up within n-tier architecture. In order to make the search secure, notably concerning surveillance by spies, we have added particular search strategies. Furthermore, in order to encourage the users to share their results, we propose to organize groups of users according to their centre of interests. This functionality is one of our main perspectives concerning this information multiagent system that has been developed in answer to demands from technological watch cells.

MAPPinfo, mapping quality of health information: study protocol for a validation study of an assessment instrument	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						information management; health &amp; safety; information technology	PATIENT; BROCHURES	Introduction Health information is a prerequisite of informed decision-making. Criteria for development, content and presentation have recently been published in a corresponding guideline. Within a systematic search, 27 relevant checklists were identified, none of them, however, complying with the guideline or providing reasonably operationalised measurement items. Therefore, a draft of a checklist with 19 criteria was drafted. The current study aims at developing and validating this measure of quality. Methods and analysis The validation design consists of five single studies to be conducted at the University of Halle-Wittenberg/Germany and Graz/Austria. (1) Achieving content validity through expert reviews of the first draft, (2) achieving feasibility using 'think aloud' in piloting with untrained users, (3) pretesting the instrument applied to health information materials without use of secondary sources: determining inter-rater reliability and criterion validity, (4) determining construct validity using information on proceedings and methods in the development process provided by the developers and (5) determining divergent validity in comparison with the Ensuring Quality Information for Patients (EQUIP) (expanded) Scale. The substudies will use varying samples of experts, students and developers and will apply the instrument to materials of various domains. Sample sizes will be adjusted to the particular research designs and questions. Analyses will employ qualitative methods, such as content analyses and discourse within the expert panel, and correlation-based methods both for determining inter-rater reliability and validity. Ethics and dissemination The project is approved by the ethics committee of the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (approval number: 2019 115). Results will be published, and the instrument made accessible on public health platforms. It is meant to become a certification standard. MAPPinfo can be used as a screening instrument without training or secondary sources. Although developed in the German language, the instrument will be applicable also in other languages.

In our study, over 100 graduate students were asked to individually conceptualize and design an extremely affordable washing machine to be used in developing countries. All participating students, many of whom had significant industry experience, were enrolled in a graduate-level product design course. This course is as much about design thinking and learning as it is about design innovation, creativity and doing design. The design of an artifact is addressed from a multidisciplinary perspective that includes determination through inspiration, ideation, and implementation using a design thinking framework. Student submissions were categorized based on (1) design methods such as concept generation, product definition, prototyping and design verification, and (2) student demographic information. The application of the design methods on the project influenced the further development of class-based exercises that infuse empathy into design. The study presented here also provides a framework for engaging distance-learning students within hands-on empathic-design exercises. The results show that techniques such as interviews of focus groups and immersive practices help students to better understand user needs in developing world contexts, leading to more feasible design solutions. Visual thinking was also linked as an effective means to engage students in empathic design without the use of physical materials.

J	Freitag, RMK				Ko Freitag, Raquel Meister			Sociolinguistic repositories as asset: challenges and difficulties in Brazil	ELECTRONIC LIBRARY			English	Article						Data collection; Challenges; Sociolinguistics; Digital language archives; Brazilian Portuguese		Purpose This paper aims to provide a context for Brazilian Portuguese language documentation and its data collection to establish linguistic repositories from a sociolinguistic overview. Design/methodology/approach The main sociolinguistic projects that have generated collections of Brazilian Portuguese language data are presented. Findings The comparison with another situation of repositories (seed vaults) and with the accounting concept of assets is evocated to map the challenges to be overcome in proposing a standardized and professional language repository to host the collections of linguistic data arising from the reported projects and others, in the accordance with the principles of the open science movement. Originality/value Thinking about the sustainability of projects to build linguistic documentation repositories, partnerships with the information technology area, or even with private companies, could minimize problems of obsolescence and safeguarding of data, by promoting the circulation and automation of analysis through natural language processing algorithms. These planning actions may help to promote the longevity of the linguistic documentation repositories of Brazilian sociolinguistic research.

J	Huang, L; Zhou, JY; Lin, JC; Deng, SL				Huang, Lei; Zhou, Jingyi; Lin, Jiecong; Deng, Shengli			View analysis of personal information leakage and privacy protection in big data era-based on Q method	ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Q method; Information leakage; Privacy protection; View; Subjectivity	SELF-DISCLOSURE; ONLINE PRIVACY; FACEBOOK; INTENTION; POLICY; PERSPECTIVES; ANTECEDENTS; STRATEGIES; PARADOX; SNS	Purpose In the era of big data, people are more likely to pay attention to privacy protection with facing the risk of personal information leakage while enjoying the convenience brought by big data technology. Furthermore, people's views on personal information leakage and privacy protection are varied, playing an important role in the legal process of personal information protection. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a semi-qualitative method based framework to reveal the subjective patterns about information leakage and privacy protection and further provide practical implications for interested party. Design/methodology/approach Q method is a semi-qualitative methodology which is designed for identifying typologies of perspectives. In order to have a comprehensive understanding of users' viewpoints, this study incorporates LDA & TextRank method and other information extraction technologies to capture the statements from large-scale literature, app reviews, typical cases and survey interviews, which could be regarded as the resource of the viewpoints. Findings By adopting the Q method that aims for studying subjective thought patterns to identify users' potential views, the authors have identified three categories of stakeholders' subjectivities: macro-policy sensitive, trade-offs and personal information sensitive, each of which perceives different risk and affordance of information leakage and importance and urgency of privacy protection. All of the subjectivities of the respondents reflect the awareness of the issue of information leakage, that is, the interested parties like social network sites are unable to protect their full personal information, while reflecting varied resistance and susceptibility of disclosing personal information for big data technology applications. Originality/value The findings of this study provide an overview of the subjective patterns on the information leakage issue. Being the first to incorporate the Q method to study the views of personal information leakage and privacy protection, the research not only broadens the application field of the Q method but also enriches the research methods for personal information protection. Besides, the proposed LDA & TextRank method in this paper alleviates the limitation of statements resource in the Q method.

How Managers Perceive Real-Time Management: Thinking Fast & Flow	CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article						organizational change; organizational design; process innovation; strategic management; technological change; information technology; time-based competition; time pressure; agility; cognitive psychology	CUSTOMER	A new era of disruptive technologies and changing business practices is moving a number of industries toward the "real-time" enterprise. With the increased capabilities of online digital platforms, managers need to deliver goods and services faster and respond rapidly to customers. It is therefore critical to ask what "real time" means to managers, what real-time management entails, and learn how enterprises capture business value through real-time management, especially when the ability to adjust and operate in real time must be ingrained in an organization's culture, structures, and processes. This article shows that managers who use "real time" in different ways can articulate different facets of experience and practices, leading to the "Fast & Flow" framework. Thinking of real time as "Fast & Flow" provides managers with insights for transitioning to real-time management that is better attuned to the organization, the market, and a technology-driven state of flux.

In a between-subject design study, participants completed a set of map-reading tasks generated by approaches to a traffic problem. These entailed quick and correct decoding of graphically represented quantitative and qualitative spatial information. The tasks first involved the decoding of one graphic variable, then of two variables simultaneously. While alternative representations of qualitative information included colour hue and symbol shape, the quantitative information was communicated either through symbol size or colour value. In bivariate tasks, quantitative and qualitative graphical elements were combined in a single display. Individual differences were also examined. The concept of cognitive style partially explains the variability in people's perception and thinking, describing individual preferences in object representation and problem-solving strategies. The data obtained in the experiment suggest that alternative forms of visualization may have different impacts on performance in map-reading tasks: colour hue and size proved more efficient in communicating information than shape and colour value. Apart from this, it was shown that individual facets of cognitive style may affect task performance, depending on the type of visualization employed.

Statistic description was used to analyze the data. The item 'inappropriate information about cancer easily leads to medical disputes' scored highest at 3.86, while the scores of such items as 'advantages of fully informing patients outweigh disadvantages', 'if their family members demand nondisclosure, you will find it difficult to cooperate in good faith with patients', and 'telling white lies to patients disturbs you a lot' were less than 3. The health care staff placed a high value on both the desire and priority of patients to know the truth, though most of them did not think that patients had received enough information about their disease. In order to improve cancer patients' current state of knowledge, health professionals should learn more about informed consent, and special methods and guidelines compatible with Chinese culture are urgently required in China.

J	Osman, S; Mohammad, S; Abu, MS; Mokhtar, M				Osman, Sharifah; Mohammad, Shahrin; Abu, Mohd Salleh; Mokhtar, Mahani			A Grounded-Theory Study of Civil Engineering Design Practice in Malaysia	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article							CRITICAL THINKING; MATHEMATICAL THINKING; SKILLS	The heart of engineering lies in problem solving. Critical thinking and mathematical thinking are inexorably linked and indispensable in complex engineering problem solving. However, the preparedness of prospective engineers in terms of having the required skills to face future challenges in the engineering workplace is still questionable and worrisome. Therefore, a study to understand the application of these two types of thinking in professional engineering practice is urgently crucial. This study focuses on having insight into the interrelation and interaction among pertinent elements of critical thinking and mathematical thinking used by engineers in professional civil engineering design practice, in the form of a substantive theory. This paper presents qualitative research using a modified grounded-theory method. Semistructured interviews were conducted with eight informants from engineering firms through theoretical sampling. Data were analyzed using modified grounded-theory analysis with analytic tools to interrelate the inductive codes, which contrasts with the more usual grounded-theory analysis. The substantive theory, named math-related critical thinking, explains six essential processes used in professional engineering design for justifying decisions reasonably. The substantive theory provides useful information for prospective engineers and engineering education, along with some implications for designing engineering curricula.

The case of fairtrade	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING			English	Article						Ethics; Branding; Conjoint analysis; Fairtrade; Dual-process theory; Information processing; Consumer behaviour	DUAL-PROCESS THEORIES; FAIR-TRADE; PROCESS MODELS; PURCHASE; BRAND; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; CHOICE; LABELS; PREFERENCES	Purpose There are substantive disagreements about whether encouraging deliberative thinking increases consumer preference in low-involvement product categories. The authors draw on dual-process theory to add rare experimental evidence to this debate. They also investigate whether the effect of deliberative thinking increases with familiarity of the stimuli, as different theories of memory yield different predictions on this point. Finally, they provide evidence on whether the effectiveness of the Fairtrade logo arises more from mere exposure or attention to the ethical claim. Design/methodology/approach The context for the research is the use of ethical logos in packaged coffee, as this provides a realistic setting for the desired experimental manipulations. The fieldwork consists of two sets of trade-off experiments - rankings based conjoint analysis (n = 360) and best-worst scaling with a balanced incomplete block design (n = 1,628). Deliberative thinking is manipulated in three ways: by varying logos between visual (Type 1 processing) and lexical (Type 2 processing) treatments, by post hoc classification of time taken, and by imposing either time constraints (Type 1) or cognitive load (Type 2) on the completion of the task. Familiarity is manipulated by varying logos between the Fairtrade and a fictional Exchange Ethics logo. Findings Consumers do have higher preferences in the deliberative treatment conditions; thinking more results in an 18 per cent increase (Cohen's d = 0.25) in the preference for choices that display an ethical cobranded logo. Surprisingly, the impact of deliberation is not greater for the more familiar Fairtrade logo than the fictional Exchange Ethics logo. This result is inconsistent with strength-based theories of memory, as these predict that deliberation will have a greater effect for more familiar stimuli. However, it is consistent with newer theories of memory that acknowledge familiarity can lead to activation confusion, reducing retrieval of pre-existing knowledge into working memory. The research also shows that the Fairtrade logo has substantial utility to consumers, and that this is approximately 59 per cent due to the ethical claim and 41 per cent due to the familiarity of the logo. Research limitations/implications - In field conditions, attempts to manipulate deliberation may not be effective or may simply result in reduced attention. Also, the costs of increasing deliberation may outweigh the benefits obtained. Practical implications - The research confirms the heuristic value of the Fairtrade logo and shows that the effectiveness of ethical logos may increase with additional deliberation by shoppers. Originality/value There is relatively little work in marketing that applies dual-process theories to investigate consumer behaviour. The present study extends the use of dual-process theories in marketing, demonstrates a new method to investigate the effect of deliberation on brand choice and shows how deliberation magnifies the effect of endorsing logos, including unfamiliar logos.

The use of digital technology in daily practices of home care nursing was analyzed based on semistructured interviews in four Swedish home care organizations. The results correspond to the two initial stages of a design thinking process: (1) knowledge about users and the use context, presented as an up-to-date description of how digital technology has affected home care nursing practice, and (2) definition of areas for improvement, presented as challenges and opportunities. We identified the following areas to proceed with in the subsequent stages of designing home care nursing digitalization: (1) nurses' ability to access information and conduct documentation in the field, particularly how new digital systems are integrated with existing routines and systems; (2) the multitude of communication processes that nurses must manage, including communication channels that are used and the level of synchronicity; (3) an increasingly complex digital working environment, where evaluating existing systems and routines is one way to learn where improvements can be most efficient.

J	Perugini, S; Ramakrishnan, N				Perugini, Saverio; Ramakrishnan, Naren			Program transformations for information personalization	COMPUTER LANGUAGES SYSTEMS & STRUCTURES			English	Article						Hierarchical hypermedia; Information personalization; Navigation; Out-of-turn interaction; Program transformations; Partial evaluation; Program slicing; Web interaction; Web mining; Website transformation	WEB; RETRIEVAL; DESIGN; MODEL; FLOW; SITE	Personalization constitutes the mechanisms necessary to automatically customize information content, structure, and presentation to the end-user to reduce information overload. Unlike traditional approaches to personalization, the central theme of our approach is to model a website as a program and conduct website transformation for personalization by program transformation (e.g., partial evaluation, program slicing). The goal of this paper is study personalization through a program transformation lens, and develop a formal model, based on program transformations, for personalized interaction with hierarchical hypermedia. The specific research issues addressed involve identifying and developing program representations and transformations suitable for classes of hierarchical hypermedia, and providing supplemental interactions for improving the personalized experience. The primary form of personalization discussed is out-of-turn interaction a technique which empowers a user navigating a hierarchical website to postpone clicking on any of the hyperlinks presented on the current page and, instead, communicate the label of a hyperlink nested deeper in the hierarchy. When the user supplies out-of-turn input we personalize the hierarchy to reflect the user's informational need. While viewing a website as a program and site transformation as program transformation is non-traditional, it offers a new way of thinking about personalized interaction, especially with hierarchical hypermedia. Our use of program transformations casts personalization in a formal setting and provides a systematic and implementation-neutral approach to designing systems. Moreover, this approach helped connect our work to human-computer dialog management and, in particular, mixed-initiative interaction. Putting personalized web interaction on a fundamentally different landscape gave birth to this new line of research. Relating concepts in the web domain (e.g., sites, interactions) to notions in the program-theoretic domain (e.g., programs, transformations) constitutes the creativity in this work.

J	Radu, LD; Popescul, D				Radu, Laura-Diana; Popescul, Daniela			The role of data platforms in COVID-19 crisis: a smart city perspective	ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Review; Early Access						Smart city; Covid-19; Smart technologies; Smart solutions; Data platform; Open data	EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES; COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY; MANAGEMENT; CITIES; HEALTH	Purpose The Covid-19 pandemic has profoundly affected urban communities, generating the need for an immediate response from local governance. The availability of urban data platforms in some smart cities helped the relevant actors to develop various solutions in an innovative and highly contextual way. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of data platforms in smart cities in the context of the Covid-19 crisis. Design/methodology/approach A total of 85 studies were identified using the Clarivate Analytics Web of Science electronic library. After applying exclusion and inclusion criteria, 61 publications were considered appropriate and reasonable for the research, being read in-depth. Finally, only 52 studies presented relevant information for the topic and were synthesized following the defined research questions. During the research, the authors included in the paper other interesting references found in selected articles and important information regarding the role of data in the fight against Covid-19 in smart cities available on the Internet and social media, with the intention to capture both academic and practical perspectives. Findings The authors' main conclusion suggests that based on their previous expertise in collecting, processing and analyzing data from multiple sources, some smart cities quickly adapted their data platforms for an efficient response against Covid-19. The results highlight the importance of open data, data sharing, innovative thinking, the collaboration between public and private stakeholders, and the participation of citizens, especially in these difficult times. Practical implications The city managers and data operators can use the presented case studies and findings to identify relevant data-driven smart solutions in the fight against Covid-19 or another crisis. Social implications The performance of smart cities is a social concern since the population of urban communities is continuously growing. By reviewing the adoption of information technologies-based solutions to improve the quality of citizens' life, the paper emphasizes their potential in societies in which information technology is embedded, especially during a major crisis. Originality/value This research re-emphasizes the importance of collecting data in smart cities, the role of the diversity of their sources and the necessity of citizens, companies and government synergetic involvement, especially in a pandemic context. The existence of smart solutions to process and extract information and knowledge from large data sets was essential for many actors involved in smart cities, helping them in the decision-making process. Based on previous expertise, some smart cities quickly adapted their data platforms for an efficient response against Covid-19. The paper analyzes also these success cases that can be considered models to be adopted by other municipalities in similar circumstances.

J	Tan, SY; Hölttä-Otto, K; Anariba, F				Tan, Shun Yu; Holtta-Otto, Katja; Anariba, Franklin			Development and Implementation of Design-Based Learning Opportunities for Students To Apply Electrochemical Principles in a Designette	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Interdisciplinary/Multidisciplinary; Electrochemistry; Chemical Engineering; Hands-On Learning/Manipulatives; High School/Introductory Chemistry	PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION; SCIENCE	A hands-on design activity named electrochemistry designette that incorporates design thinking with the aims to strengthen electrochemistry concepts, introduce prototyping ideas, encourage student class participation, and foster creativity is presented. This active learning activity, which lies at the interface of design and electrochemistry (mixed methods approach), allows students tb experience design thinking as a creative tool through the application of electrochemical principles. The designette permits the students to design and prototype, from an available design prototyping kit, a 6-cell electrochemical device capable of turning on 4 light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The electrochemical device consists of electrode pairs composed of Cu, Zn, Al, and Sn electrodes, along with rice wine and CuSO4 solution as electrolytes, connected via staples, wires, and eyelets. The designette allows for the direct and objective evaluation of students' performance via three critical parameters: the number of prototypes created, the power harnessed by the voltaic device, and the number of total LEDs powered on by the device. The effectiveness of the designette as a pedagogical tool for design-based learning (DBL) was evaluated through pre- and post-designette electrochemistry tests. Generally, results show that the designette improves the student's ability to recall information, therefore enhancing the learning experience of the students. Students who participated in the designette displayed statistically significantly higher scores in the electrochemistry assessment after the designette. Furthermore, we found some evidence between performance in the designette and post-designette creativity. Interestingly, no correlations were found between performance in theoretical quizzes, designette performance, or pre-designette creativity metrics. The electrochemistry designette can be carried out as an activity in a chemistry course or a workshop on design for high school students with a background in electrochemistry, for undergraduate engineering and architecture students, and for general undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory general science course, independently of their interest in design.

J	Wang, YH				Wang, Yi Hsuan			Integrating Games, e-Books and AR Techniques to Support Project-based Science Learning	EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY			English	Article						Interdisciplinary projects; Project-based learning; Game-based learning; AR support learning	AUGMENTED REALITY; ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; TECHNOLOGY; METAANALYSIS; EFFICACY	The study integrated learning technology and various e-learning materials to assist teachers in conducting project-based learning for a science course. The activities were designed for learning science concepts such as circuits and the symbols of electricity firstly, and then for applying the concepts to produce a scientific toy. The study intended to integrate the value of the convenience and accessibility of e-books, the feature of interactive demonstration, a combination of visual information with physical objects using augmented reality (AR), and the enjoyment brought by game-based learning to create an integrated e-learning model to support project-based learning processes. A total of 51 elementary school students were invited to take part in the research and were separated into two groups, one using the game-based learning environment with AR-based materials and the other with e-books for the science project-based activity. Despite the quantitative data not presenting any learning differences for the two groups, the qualitative results showed that the e-learning materials with multimedia content were helpful for scaffolding students while completing the hands-on scientific electric current toy, and triggered peer discussion to achieve concept agreement. For example, the text and figures in the e-books helped the students to doubly confirm the processes of the learning information, while the colored blocks on the physical objects in the AR materials facilitated assembly of the elements to complete the science toy. It was noticed that the well-designed AR materials might hinder learners' thinking ability and restrict their creativity, and hence, the researcher proposes a revised e-learning integration model that combines the advantages of e-books and AR techniques to create more easily accessible e-learning supports and to encourage active thinking for fostering independent and self-regulated learners.

Adopting innovative thinking methods, we instructed students on the projects and goals of curriculum design. Using TIPS tools, the students completed complex projects. To test the teaching results, we examined 121 students who received case-based teaching using the TIPS method to design innovative projects. Quantitative data were collected using a statistically analysed anonymised questionnaire, while qualitative data collected from student reflective reports were thematically analysed. Through the in-depth development involved in the teaching of this course, their thinking and problem-solving ability significantly improved. The teaching effect evaluations indicated that this teaching method effectively improved students' practical abilities. This method was found to be conducive to planning students' future careers.

This paper reflects on the internalization of stories from a cognitive perspective and outlines a visualization framework for supporting the analysis of narrative geotemporal data. We discuss the strengths and limitations of standard techniques for representing spatiotemporal data (coordinated views, animation or slideshow, layer superimposition, juxtaposition, and space-time cube representation) and think about their effects on mental representations of a story. Many current visualization systems offer multiple views and allow the user to investigate different aspects of a story. From a cognitive point of view, it is important to assist users in reconnecting these multiple perspectives into a coherent picture-e.g., by utilizing coherence techniques like seamless transitions. A case study involving visualizing biographical narratives illustrates how the design of advanced visualization systems can be cognitively and conceptually grounded to support the construction of an integrated internal representation.

We combine Theory of Planned Behaviour. and Norm-activation Theory to build a research model, through scale development and questionnaire design, we carry out field research in Shandong Province, China. We collect 462 valid questionnaires as basic data for the research. We utilise exploratory factor analysis and structural equation model for data analysis and hypothesis test, and the results show that information publicity cannot directly influence residents' behaviour intentions, but indirectly affect their intentions through two mediating variables - Personal norm and Recycling attitude. We think current information publicity about e-waste recycling is insufficient, or the publicity content thereof does not actually promote the willingness to recycle. So, we should improve the frequency of publicity events and focus on their publicity content.

J	Sun, LH; Zhou, L				Sun, Lihui; Zhou, Liang			Does text-based programming improve K-12 students' CT skills? Evidence from a meta-analysis and synthesis of qualitative data in educational contexts	THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY			English	Article						K-12; Computational thinking (CT) skills; Text-based programming; Instruction design; Meta-analysis	COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; SELF-EFFICACY; SCRATCH; LANGUAGE; OUTCOMES	Promoting computational thinking (CT) skills in programming activities has become a key issue in K-12 education, and the shift from visual to text-based programming is an inevitable trend in programming education. Although research on K-12 text-based programming to promote CT skills has been increasing, a literature review that systematically organizes and analyzes it has not yet emerged. Moreover, there are no uniform conclusions on how to design text-based programming activities to effectively promote students' acquisition of CT skills. The purpose of this study was mainly to determine the effectiveness of using text-based programming to enhance K-12 students' CT skills, to explore the effects of various text-based programming instructional design factors on CT skill acquisition, and to discuss the key issues and future development of text programming in the K-12 stage. In this study using the quantitative method of meta-analysis and the qualitative method of systematic literature review, 46 studies of text-based programming on K-12 students' CT skills were retrieved, of which 19 empirical studies including 37 effects size met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis and were therefore used as a meta-analysis. The results showed that text-based programming improved the CT skills of K-12 students overall (Hedges' g = 0.71, 95% CI [0.51, 0.90], p < 0.01). No publication bias was detected. In addition, the results of the moderator analysis revealed that: 1) text programming had the greatest impact on computational thinking development in middle school students (g = 0.833, p = <0.05); 2) the duration of text programming instruction had the most significant positive impact on students' CT at 16-20 weeks (g = 1.038, p <0.05); 3) the moderating effect of different assessment tools on CT skills in text programming instruction The difference was statistically significant, and the test assessment method had a highly significant positive moderating effect on CT skills of students in grades K-12 (g = 1.005, p < 0.05); 4) The moderating effect of different student sample sizes on students' computational thinking development was significantly different, and the implementation of text -based programming instruction had the most significant effect on students' CT improvement among students with sample sizes of 41 similar to 60 (g = 0.921, p < 0.05); 5) There were no significant differences in the effects of different text-based programming languages and learning environ-ments on students' computational thinking.However, there are still barriers to developing instructional practices for text-based programming to foster CT in K-12 students, such as the highly abstract and complex syntax of text-based programming. This study found that the most critical issues that need to be addressed in current text-based programming to foster CT in K-12 students are the lack of student interest in text-based programming and the misconceptions that arise when students move from visual programming to text-based programming. To address these issues, future research could begin with improving teaching methods and increasing student motivation and interest. To address these issues, future research could begin with improving teaching methods and increasing students' motivation and interest.

J	Li, B; Chen, WM; He, CQ; Zhang, YW				Li, Bao; Chen, Wanming; He, Changqing; Zhang, Yuwen			Team autonomy, information exchange and team innovation performance: the moderating role of team conflict	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Team autonomy; Team innovation performance; Team information exchange; Team conflict; MIP-G theory	TASK CONFLICT; DECISION-MAKING; EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY; DESIGN RESEARCH; MEDIATING ROLE; WORK TEAMS; MODEL; DIVERSITY; INTERDEPENDENCE; CONSEQUENCES	Purpose Team autonomy is thought to be important for team innovation performance. However, the theoretical basis of the relationship between team autonomy and team innovation performance is not well understood, and previous studies have found inconsistent relations between them. Based on motivated information processing in groups (MIP-G) theory, this paper aims to explain how and when team autonomy could influence team innovation performance from a new team-level perspective. Design/methodology/approach Using a two-wave, time-lagged survey design, the authors collected data from 340 members of 86 teams in China. PROCESS 3.0 for SPSS was used to test hypothesized relationships. Findings The results show that team autonomy is positively related to team information exchange. Team information exchange mediates the positive relationship between team autonomy and team innovation performance. Furthermore, the positive relationship between team autonomy and team information exchange is stronger with less task conflict, which runs contrary to the hypothesis. Additionally, relationship conflict does not adjust the impact of team autonomy on team information exchange. Originality/value This study provides a new perspective to explain the mechanism between team autonomy and team innovation performance at team level from the information processing approach, specifically, MIP-G theory. It also incorporates team conflicts as important contextual factors to answer the call for a wider study of boundary conditions in the team autonomy research.

A user-centred design framework for mHealth	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MOBILE; SCIENCE	Background Mobile health (mHealth) has the potential to improve access to healthcare, especially in developing countries. The proliferation of mHealth has not been accompanied by a corresponding growth in design guidelines for mHealth applications. This paper proposes a framework for mHealth application design that combines the Information Systems Research (ISR) framework and design thinking. We demonstrate a use case for the proposed framework in the form of an app to read the result of the tuberculin skin test (TST), which is used to screen for latent tuberculosis infection. The framework was used in the re-design of the TST reading app but could also be used in earlier stages of mHealth app design. Methods The ISR framework and design thinking were merged based on how the modes of design thinking integrate with the cycles of the ISR framework. Using the combined framework, we re-designed an mHealth app for TST reading, intended to be used primarily in a developing context by healthcare workers. Using the proposed framework, the app was iterated upon and developed with the aid of personas, observations, prototyping and questionnaires. Result The combined framework was applied through engagement with end-users, namely ten healthcare workers and ten graduate students. Through review of the literature and iterations of the app prototype, we identified various usability requirements and limitations. These included challenges related to image capture and a misunderstanding of instructions. These insights influenced the development and improvement of the app. Conclusion The combined framework allowed for engagement with end-users and for low-cost, rapid development of the app while addressing contextual challenges and needs. The integration of design thinking modes with the ISR cycles was effective in achieving the objectives of each approach. The combined framework acknowledges the importance of engaging users when implementing mHealth technologies, especially in developing and under-resourced contexts. Findings from this study support the use of this framework as a guide in the design of user-centred mHealth interventions.

J	Barclay, C; Osei-Bryson, KM				Barclay, Corlane; Osei-Bryson, Kweku-Muata			Project performance development framework: An approach for developing performance criteria & measures for information systems (IS) projects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Project performance framework (PPDF) model; Measures; Performance criteria; Success criteria; Project objectives; IS projects; Design science	VALUE-FOCUSED ASSESSMENT; BALANCED SCORECARD; SUCCESS FACTORS; MANAGEMENT; METHODOLOGY; SECURITY; DECISION; SCIENCE; DESIGN	Performance criteria typically reflect the values of the project stakeholders in how they will be viewing their projects. A critical analysis of current research shows that several key challenges being faced in information systems (IS) projects include the lack of clearly defined objectives, mismatched stakeholders' expectations and lack of sufficient or formal methods to aid practitioners in developing relevant performance criteria. This is accentuated by growing calls to rethink the traditional measurement paradigm. Moreover, most of the known solutions in practice are without structured or easily implementable procedures to elicit and develop performance criteria and measures. Against this background, the paper proposes a formal method to develop a comprehensive set of performance criteria or objectives grounded in the views of the project stakeholders and associated measures aligned to these objectives. The project performance framework (PPDF) primarily relies on the principles and advantages of the value focused thinking (VFT) and goal question metric (GQM) to elicit and develop these performance criteria and associated measures based on the values of the stakeholders in the project. Three project cases are used to illustrate and assess the model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Advances in malaria-related social, behavioral,economic, evaluation, health systems, and policy (social science) research have resulted in improvements in the design and implementation of malaria prevention, management and control (PMC) strategies. Indeed, the past two decades chronicle dramatic advances in the implementation of evidence-based interventions, drawn not only from biomedical but also from social science research. Malaria awareness-raising, advocacy, case management, and prevention efforts have reaped the benefits of social science research and as a result, many programs are implemented and evaluated in a more effective manner than in the past. However, the pace at which findings from social science research are integrated into program and policy implementation is unsatisfactory. Additionally, examples remain of programs that fail to utilize findings front social science research and as a result, achieve minimal results. Furthermore, there is a sizeable body of knowledge that is underutilized and which, if assimilated into programs and policies, could accelerate progress in malaria PMC. Examples include information on meaningful community participation, gender, socio-economic status, and health systems. Regrettably, although social science input is necessary for almost all interventions for malaria management and control, the numbers of scientists working in this area are dismal in most of the key disciplines-medical anthropology; demography; geography and sociology; health economics and health policy; social psychology social epidemiology and behavior-change communication. Further, skills of program workers charged with implementation of interventions and strategies at country level are most often inadequate. The Special Program for Research and training in tropical diseases (TDR) and the multi-lateral initiative on malaria (MIM) have remained in the forefront of capacity building for this area of research, but additional efforts are needed to bring more applied social scientists into the fold. Their skills are necessary to ensure that social science findings get to program planners and implementers in a useful form that allows for more rapid and appropriate integration of the results into malaria PMC programs and policies. A re-thinking of the current focus within capacity building efforts is proposed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

I support this claim with four ideas about cognition: (1) interacting with tools changes the way we think and perceive - tools, when manipulated, are soon absorbed into the body schema, and this absorption leads to fundamental changes in the way we perceive and conceive of our environments; (2) we think with our bodies not just with our brains; (3) we know more by doing than by seeing - there are times when physically performing an activity is better than watching someone else perform the activity, even though our motor resonance system fires strongly during other person observation; (4) there are times when we literally think with things. These four ideas have major implications for interaction design, especially the design of tangible, physical, context aware, and telepresence systems.

Kids, and ask Kids	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						information retrieval; search engines; children	WEB SEARCH ENGINES; PHYSICAL BEHAVIORS; YAHOOLIGANS; CRITERIA; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; THINKING; SEEKING; NOTION; WHOLE	This study employed benchmarking and intellectual relevance judgment in evaluating Google, Yahoo!, Bing, Yahoo! Kids, and Ask Kids on 30 queries that children formulated to find information for specific tasks. Retrieved hits on given queries were benchmarked to Google's and Yahoo! Kids' top-five ranked hits retrieved. Relevancy of hits was judged on a graded scale; precision was calculated using the precision-at-ten metric (P@10). Yahoo! and Bing produced a similar percentage in hit overlap with Google (nearly 30%), but differed in the ranking of hits. Ask Kids retrieved 11% in hit overlap with Google versus 3% by Yahoo! Kids. The engines retrieved 26 hits across query clusters that overlapped with Yahoo! Kids' top-five ranked hits. Precision (P) that the engines produced across the queries was P?=?0.48 for relevant hits, and P?=?0.28 for partially relevant hits. Precision by Ask Kids was P?=?0.44 for relevant hits versus P?=?0.21 by Yahoo! Kids. Bing produced the highest total precision (TP) of relevant hits (TP?=?0.86) across the queries, and Yahoo! Kids yielded the lowest (TP?=?0.47). Average precision (AP) of relevant hits was AP?=?0.56 by leading engines versus AP?=?0.29 by small engines. In contrast, average precision of partially relevant hits was AP?=?0.83 by small engines versus AP?=?0.33 by leading engines. Average precision of relevant hits across the engines was highest on two-word queries and lowest on one-word queries. Google performed best on natural language queries; Bing did the same (P?=?0.69) on two-word queries. The findings have implications for search engine ranking algorithms, relevance theory, search engine design, research design, and information literacy.

The Consequences of Reading Inaccurate Information	CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						memory; reading comprehension; learning; misinformation; text processing	INCORRECT INFORMATION; CONTINUED INFLUENCE; MEMORY; MISINFORMATION; COMPREHENSION; KNOWLEDGE; FICTION; CREDIBILITY; VALIDATION; RETRIEVAL	We are regularly confronted with statements that are inaccurate, sometimes obviously so. Unfortunately, people can be influenced by and rely upon inaccurate information, engaging in less critical evaluation than might be hoped. Empirical studies have consistently demonstrated that even when people should know better, reading inaccurate information can affect their performance on subsequent tasks. What encourages people's encoding and use of false statements? The current article outlines how reliance on inaccurate information is a predictable consequence of the routine cognitive processes associated with memory, problem solving, and comprehension. This view helps identify conditions under which inaccurate information is more or less likely to influence subsequent decisions. These conditions are informative in the consideration of information-design approaches and instructional methods intended to support critical thinking.

Extensive research has provided rich information toward system development, courses design, and nurses' satisfaction with an e-learning system. However, a comprehensive view in understanding nursing e-learning system success is an important but less focused-on topic. The purpose of this research was to explore net benefits of nursing e-learning systems based on the updated DeLone and McLean's Information System Success Model. The study used a self-administered questionnaire to collected 208 valid nurses' responses from 21 of Taiwan's medium-and large-scale hospitals that have implemented nursing e-learning systems. The result confirms that the model is sufficient to explore the nurses' use of e-learning systems in terms of intention to use, user satisfaction, and net benefits. However, while the three exogenous quality factors (system quality, information quality, and service quality) were all found to be critical factors affecting user satisfaction, only information quality showed a direct effect on the intention to use. This study provides useful insights for evaluating nursing e-learning system qualities as well as an understanding of nurses' intentions and satisfaction related to performance benefits.

Dickkopf proteins (DKKs) are thought to inhibit Wnt signaling pathway through binding to lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5/6. In this study, based on the 3-dimensional (3D) structure of DKK3 Cys-rich domain 2 (CRD2), we have designed and developed several peptide inhibitors of Wnt signaling pathway. Modeller 9.15 package was used to predict 3D structure of CRD2 based on the Homology modeling (HM) protocol. After refinement and minimization with GalaxyRefine and NOMAD-REF servers, the quality of selected models was evaluated utilizing VADAR, SAVES and ProSA servers. Molecular docking studies as well as literature-based information revealed two distinct boxes located at CRD2 which are actively involved in the DKK3-LRP5/6 interaction. A peptide library was constructed conducting the backrub sequence tolerance scanning protocol in Rosetta3.5 according to the DKK3-LRP5/6 binding sites. Seven tolerated peptides were chosen and their binding affinity and stability were improved by some logical amino acid substitutions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of peptide-LRP5/6 complexes were carried out using GROMACS package. After evaluation of binding free energies, stability, electrostatic potential and some physicochemical properties utilizing computational approaches, three peptides (PEP-I1, PEP-I3 and PEP-II2) demonstrated desirable features. However, all seven improved peptides could sufficiently block the Wnt-binding site of LRP6 in silico. In conclusion, we have designed and improved several small peptides based on the LRP6-binding site of CRD2 of DKK3. These peptides are highly capable of binding to LRP6 in silico, and may prevent the formation of active Wnt-LRP6-Fz complex.

Despite women's underrepresentation, we find little support for positive action measures, and in particular for legal gender quotas. Binary logit analyses show that support for the introduction of positive action measures is not affected by citizens' perceptions about the share of female members of parliament. However, experimental data reveal that receiving information about women's actual proportion in parliament has an impact on citizens' support for gender quotas, in particular among those who overestimate women's representation. Once they learn that the actual share is lower than they thought, they are more likely to support the introduction of quotas. This indicates that support for positive action measures can be changed through providing the correct information.

The current research studies how the immersion of Virtual Reality (VR) in architectural design studio affects spatial perception through the design process. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of using such environments on changing the way how to design for human experience: how it will improve students' spatial understanding of Three Dimensions (3D) volumes, and how it will enhance their imagination, enrich their creativity and promote their ability to experience their design's sensations. This study hypothesizes that using an immersive virtual environment in design studio will empower students' imaginations and give them the ability to understand and experience their ideas. It will give them the opportunity to check their design's validity with greater 3D exploration, understanding and comprehension of spatial volumes. Within a framework of an experimental design research, a series of experiments was conducted to evaluate what had been assumed. The research used teaching, monitoring, explanatory observation and evaluation methods. The results showed that VR can not only enhance spatial perception and improve the design, but also it can affect the design process and make changes in the architectural design way of thinking. It can help designers to incorporate human experience within the design process.

Yet, our memory is fragile and could be easily impaired, and the prevalence of memory disorders is increasing in correlation with the population's mean age. As expected, auxiliary memory devices (such as writing pads and computers) are abundant but are operated indirectly using significant effort compared with biological memory. We report a working prototype of a simplified, 4KB random-access memory (RAM) that can be written to or read from using thought and could be embedded more seamlessly than other artificial memory aids. The system analyses EEG signals to extract attention levels, which trained subjects can use to write messages into an RFID sticker, or read from it on a display. We describe basic modes of using memory by a single subject, emulate common forms of social communication using this system, and highlight new forms of social usage and allocation of memories that are linked to specific persons. This preliminary prototype highlights the technical feasibility and the possibilities of implantable thought-operated memory devices and could be developed further to provide seamless aid to people suffering from memory disorders in the near future.

Brief, embedded, spontaneous metacognitive talk indicates thinking like a physicist	PHYSICAL REVIEW SPECIAL TOPICS-PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH			English	Article							STUDENT EXPECTATIONS; SCIENCE; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK; EXAMPLES; CULTURE; DESIGN; LEARN	[This paper is part of the Focused Collection on Upper Division Physics Courses.] Instructors and researchers think "thinking like a physicist" is important for students' professional development. However, precise definitions and observational markers remain elusive. We reinterpret popular beliefs inventories in physics to indicate what physicists think thinking like a physicist entails. Through discourse analysis of upper-division students' speech in natural settings, we show that students may appropriate or resist these elements. We identify a new element in the physicist speech genre: brief, embedded, spontaneous metacognitive talk (BESM talk). BESM talk communicates students' in-the-moment enacted expectations about physics as a technical field and a cultural endeavor. Students use BESM talk to position themselves as physicists or nonphysicists. Students also use BESM talk to communicate their expectations in four ways: understanding, confusion, spotting inconsistencies, and generalized expectations.

One promising method to facilitate learners' higher-order thinking is to utilize a web map mind tool to assist learners in applying spatial thinking to cooperative problem solving. In this study, an environment is designed based on the theory of spatial thinking and developed to help learners engage in project-based learning that utilizes the proposed web map mind tool for tour planning. The participants were 66 college students, and a quasi-experimental research design was employed. This study examined the differences in the learning performance and project performance between participants using the web map mind tool (the experimental group) and ordinary Internet search engines (the control group). The results indicate the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group in terms of both learning performance and project performance. In addition, we found that the students in the two groups held a positive learning attitude toward the project activity of tour planning. In terms of students' attitude toward the use of a mind tool, this study only conducted a survey for the experimental group. The results indicated that learners in the experimental group held a positive attitude toward the use of the web map mind tool.

ASLIB PROCEEDINGS			English	Article						Electronic books; Academic staff; Students		Purpose - The purpose of this article is to report on a large-scale survey that was carried Out to assess academic users' awareness, perceptions and existing levels of use of e-books. The survey also seeks to find out about the purposes to which electronic books were put, and to obtain an understanding of the most effective library marketing and communication channels. Design/methodology/approach - An e-mail invitation to participate in the survey was distributed to all UCL staff and students (approximately 27,000) in November 2006, and 1,818 completions were received, an effective response rate of at least 6.7 per cent. Statistical analyses were carried out on the data using Software Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Findings - The survey findings point to various ways in which user uptake and acceptance of e-books may be encouraged. Book discovery behaviour, a key issue for publishers and librarians in both print and electronic environments, emerges as a critical focus for service delivery and enhancement. Originality/value - The survey is part of an action research project, CIBER's SuperBook, that will further investigate the issues raised in this initial benchmarking survey using deep log analysis and qualitative methods. The paper partly fills the gap in the literature on e-books which has mainly focused on usage and not the users.

Different tools exist to support the learning of CT, namely visual programming languages and tangible development platforms (TDP), which are widely used in extra-curricular activities. To date, few tools have been developed that consider both teachers' needs and the school context. We designed the Kniwwelino Classroom Kit (KCK) in order to support the teaching of CT in classrooms. This paper presents the results of a pilot study, in which the KCK was used in three primary and three secondary schools in Luxembourg. The KCK is based on Kniwwelino, a creative environment designed for children from 8 years old to learn about programming and electronics. The study explored the suitability of the KCK for teaching CT in primary and secondary schools, focusing on three research questions: (1) how the KCK supports teachers' pedagogical practices, (2) how the KCK fulfils the pedagogical objectives set by teachers, and (3) the user experience of the KCK (for teachers and pupils). To assess how the KCK meets the three above-mentioned objectives, we used a mixed method approach, combining semi-guided interviews, logbooks, and several questionnaires. We learned that the KCK is versatile enough to adapt to different environments, objectives, and pedagogical approaches, which responds to the first two research questions, and thus offers a great deal of freedom to teachers. The fun and tangible approach of the KCK introduces programming and enables pupils to develop both CT and soft skills such as communication and collaboration. Teachers' feedback on their user experience was positive, particularly concerning stimulation, novelty, and attractiveness. KCK was evaluated as interesting, valuable, and good, but it was noted that some improvements needed to be made to make it easier, more predictable, and faster. The pupils also rated their user experience positively, with values that were generally on a par with previous studies reported in the state of the art regarding the use of Scratch and BBC Micro:bit in school-based experiments for learning CT. Drawing from these learnings, we list several recommendations for the development of other similar TDP tools to support the teaching of CT in a classroom setting. These recommendations concern the material, programming interface, connection, educational material, and the creation of a community.

Firstly, the correlation strength between assembled parts is analyzed and evaluated based on multi-source correlation information including assembly structure, function and flows. Then, the weighted network is constructed for expressing correlation relationships between assembled parts in the assembly model. After that, a community detection algorithm upon greedy thought is given to discover communities in weighted network, thereby realizing the modularization of mechanical CAD assembly model. Finally, two CAD assembly models are employed to verify feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Berry, DA; Herbst, RS; Rubin, EH				Berry, Donald A.; Herbst, Roy S.; Rubin, Eric H.			Reports from the 2010 Clinical and Translational Cancer Research Think Tank Meeting: Design Strategies for Personalized Therapy Trials	CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							SIGNATURE; RECEPTOR	It has long been evident that cancer is a heterogeneous disease, but only relatively recently have we come to realize the extent of this heterogeneity. No single therapy is effective for every patient with tumors having the same histology. A clinical strategy based on a single-therapy approach results in overtreatment for the majority of patients. Biomarkers can be considered as knives that dissect the disease ever more finely. The future of clinical research will be based on learning whether certain therapies are more appropriate than others for biomarker-defined subsets of patients. Therapies will eventually be tailored to narrow biomarker subsets. The ability to determine which therapies are appropriate for which patients requires information from biological science as well as empirical evidence from clinical trials. Neither is easy to achieve. Here we describe some nascent approaches for designing clinical trials that are biomarker-based and adaptive. Our focus is on adaptive trials that address many questions at once. In a way, these clinical experiments are themselves part of a much larger experiment: learning how (or whether it is possible) to design experiments that match patients in small subsets of disease with therapies that are especially effective and possibly even curative for them.

We describe the current state of HTE and illustrate its speed and accuracy using an FTIR imaging system for oxidation of CO over metals. However, data is just information and not knowledge. In order to more effectively extract knowledge from HTE data, we propose a framework that, through advanced models and novel software architectures, strives to approximate the thought processes of the human expert. In the forward model the underlying chemistry is described as rules and the data or predictions as features. We discuss how our modeling framework-via a knowledge extraction (KE) engine-transparently maps rules-to-equations-to-parameters-to-features as part of the forward model. We show that our KE engine is capable of robust, automated model refinement, when modeled features do not match the experimental features. Further, when multiple models exist that can describe experimental data, new sets of HTE can be suggested. Thus, the KE engine improves (i) selection of chemistry rules and (ii) the completeness of the HTE data set as the model and data converge. We demonstrate the validity of the KE engine and model refinement capabilities using the production of aromatics from propane on H-ZSM-5. We also discuss how the framework applies to the inverse model, in order to meet the design challenge of predicting catalyst compositions for desired performance. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

On being informational: intertwining the communication and self-production flows	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Information science; Cells; Communication flow; Information model systems; Knowledge recombination; Scientomics; Self-production flow	SYSTEMS; EVOLUTION	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advocate a change of perspective in the development of information science. At stake is whether this science will be able to make sense of both the astounding new practices in the world of knowledge and the even more astounding social transformations that revolve around information technologies. Tentatively a new way of thinking could be articulated along the guidelines herein discussed. An initial and important aspect concerns the definition of information itself. Rather than continuing with the endless discussions on what is information, it will be proposed, first, that information is indefinable per se; and second, that a consensus notion(s) might be established on how information should be handled in the core fields - or at least in the analysis of some prototypical "informational entities". Design/methodology/approach - The research strategy proposed, naturalistic and empirically oriented, is based on the intertwining of self-production and communication flows as fundamental characteristics of informational entities - about "being in the world" in the informational way. Living cells, organisms (nervous systems), individuals, enterprises-markets, and societies would manifest these characteristics. In all of these existential realms, it is the collective action of communicating, self-producing agents or entities ("informational" ones, for short), connected in multiple, flexible ways, what makes possible the unfathomable complexity and adaptability emerging at all functional scales. Findings - Along this new perspective, meaning, knowledge, and intelligence may be approached rather consistently. The new conceptualizations may also be linked with the information revolution and the extraordinary expansion of knowledge in the times; a parallel with the knowledge-fundamentals of biological complexity will be suggested. Originality/value - Among the many problems to tackle for a renewed information science, a relevant matter concerns the way to organize the dialogue among so many different disciplinary perspectives dealing with information: it becomes an open question, indeed.

This paper reports the ease of adoption assessment methods we developed for this track, and the results of evaluating five clinical NLP system submissions. Materials and methods: A team of human evaluators performed a series of scripted adoptability test tasks with each of the participating systems. The evaluation team consisted of four "expert evaluators'' with training in computer science, and eight "end user evaluators'' with mixed backgrounds in medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and health informatics. We assessed how easy it is to adopt the submitted systems along the following three dimensions: communication effectiveness (i.e., how effective a system is in communicating its designed objectives to intended audience), effort required to install, and effort required to use. We used a formal software usability testing tool, TURF, to record the evaluators' interactions with the systems and 'think-aloud' data revealing their thought processes when installing and using the systems and when resolving unexpected issues. Results: Overall, the ease of adoption ratings that the five systems received are unsatisfactory. Installation of some of the systems proved to be rather difficult, and some systems failed to adequately communicate their designed objectives to intended adopters. Further, the average ratings provided by the end user evaluators on ease of use and ease of interpreting output are -0.35 and -0.53, respectively, indicating that this group of users generally deemed the systems extremely difficult to work with. While the ratings provided by the expert evaluators are higher, 0.6 and 0.45, respectively, these ratings are still low indicating that they also experienced considerable struggles. Discussion: The results of the Track 3 evaluation show that the adoptability of the five participating clinical NLP systems has a great margin for improvement. Remedy strategies suggested by the evaluators included (1) more detailed and operation system specific use instructions; (2) provision of more pertinent onscreen feedback for easier diagnosis of problems; (3) including screen walk-throughs in use instructions so users know what to expect and what might have gone wrong; (4) avoiding jargon and acronyms in materials intended for end users; and (5) packaging prerequisites required within software distributions so that prospective adopters of the software do not have to obtain each of the third-party components on their own.

Insulation for Daydreams: A Role for Tonic Norepinephrine in the Facilitation of Internally Guided Thought	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STIMULUS-INDEPENDENT THOUGHT; LOCUS-COERULEUS; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; EXECUTIVE-CONTROL; WANDERING MINDS; WORKING-MEMORY; ADAPTIVE GAIN; EXPERIENCE; ATTENTION; BRAIN	Although consciousness can be brought to bear on both perceptual and internally generated information, little is known about how these different cognitive modes are coordinated. Here we show that between-participant variance in thoughts unrelated to the task being performed (known as task unrelated thought, TUT) is associated with longer response times (RT) when target presentation occurs during periods when baseline Pupil Diameter (PD) is increased. As behavioral interference due to high baseline PD can reflect increased tonic activity in the norepinephrine system (NE), these results might implicate high tonic NE activity in the facilitation of TUTs. Based on these findings, it is hypothesised that high tonic mode NE leads to a generalised de-amplification of task relevant information that prioritses internally generated thought and insulates it from the potentially disruptive events taking place in the external environment.

J	Li, WQ; Li, Y; Wang, J; Liu, XY				Li, Wenqiang; Li, Yan; Wang, Jian; Liu, Xiaoying			The process model to aid innovation of products conceptual design	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Conceptual design; Innovative strategies; Process mapping; Extension reasoning; Mathematical model	SYSTEM; FRAMEWORK	Currently, designers often pay little attention to integrated innovation during the design process of products. In addition, the product assistance design systems mainly focus on the detailed design phrase and the construction function of mathematics models are often been neglected. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a conceptual design process model to aid multi-stage innovation of product design based on the integration of the essential rules of the Axiomatic Design (AD) model, Function-Behaviour-Structure (FBS) model, and the guideline of functional creative thinking logics. By utilising the function tree and functional structure tree as the mediums to express the design information and by applying the conflict solving strategies of Extensic theory, the conceptual design process is defined as an integrated system with five stages and four mappings. The integrated logical processes of this model are described with mathematical language. Thus, the whole transformation from design experiences to design principles and to mathematical model finally to aided design system is realized perfectly in the proposed process model. The meaningful exploration on the nature and practical processes of product conceptual design is carried out in this research. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evaluating the scope of digital media art education using the decision support system	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article; Early Access						Digital information; Creative thinking; Art learners; Graph Theory Matrix Approach	DESIGN; LITERACY	Our lives have been significantly changed by the development of numerous technologies and applications, such as computers and information and communication technologies. Due to these advancements, we are now living in the era of digital information, where the creation, distribution, and access to valuable information are very efficient and easy. People are now using these modern-day tools as an effective means for learning and teaching in various fields, including art-related subjects. The availability of intelligent media has enabled the creation of high-quality arts and their dissemination to a large segment of the population. The different digital technologies are employed by the teachers to enhance the creative thinking and cognitive abilities of the learners. In the proposed study, the existing modern media-based approaches implemented for the teaching and learning of the arts are discussed and analyzed. It was realized that art learners can create highly interactive and effective artworks due to the availability of smart and intelligent devices. The literacy of the teachers regarding these new tools is very essential for the creation of technology-grounded arts and to enhance the learners' skills by using information and communication technologies. After the analysis of the existing literature, various important characteristics were identified. Then, the most important ones are selected according to the most efficient ranking of the available alternatives. To perform the systematic and precise ranking of the accessible alternatives, an effective procedure named Graph Theory and Matrix Approach (GTMA) was employed. The study can assist the researchers in the development and design of beneficial paradigms in the field.

In the course of this development computing models have been extended from the initial abstract symbol manipulating mechanisms of stand-alone, discrete sequential machines, to the models of natural computing in the physical world, generally concurrent asynchronous processes capable of modelling living systems, their informational structures and dynamics on both symbolic and sub-symbolic information processing levels. Present account of models of computation highlights several topics of importance for the development of new understanding of computing and its role: natural computation and the relationship between the model and physical implementation, interactivity as fundamental for computational modelling of concurrent information processing systems such as living organisms and their networks, and the new developments in logic needed to support this generalized framework. Computing understood as information processing is closely related to natural sciences; it helps us recognize connections between sciences, and provides a unified approach for modeling and simulating of both living and non-living systems.

User-Centered Clinical Display Design Issues for Inpatient Providers	APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						electronic health records; data display; visualization; abstraction; information overload; clinician burnout	ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD; MEDICAL ICU CLINICIAN; INFORMATION NEEDS; INTERFACE DESIGN; PATIENT; CARE; PHYSICIANS; USABILITY; VISUALIZATION; TECHNOLOGY	Background Suboptimal information display in electronic health records (EHRs) is a notorious pain point for users. Designing an effective display is difficult, due in part to the complex and varied nature of clinical practice. Objective This article aims to understand the goals, constraints, frustrations, and mental models of inpatient medical providers when accessing EHR data, to better inform the display of clinical information. Methods A multidisciplinary ethnographic study of inpatient medical providers. Results Our participants' primary goal was usually to assemble a clinical picture around a given question, under the constraints of time pressure and incomplete information. To do so, they tend to use a mental model of multiple layers of abstraction when thinking of patients and disease; they prefer immediate pattern recognition strategies for answering clinical questions, with breadth-first or depth-first search strategies used subsequently if needed; and they are sensitive to data relevance, completeness, and reliability when reading a record. Conclusion These results conflict with the ubiquitous display design practice of separating data by type (test results, medications, notes, etc.), a mismatch that is known to encumber efficient mental processing by increasing both navigation burden and memory demands on users. A popular and obvious solution is to select or filter the data to display exactly what is presumed to be relevant to the clinical question, but this solution is both brittle and mistrusted by users. A less brittle approach that is more aligned with our users' mental model could use abstraction to summarize details instead of filtering to hide data. An abstraction-based approach could allow clinicians to more easily assemble a clinical picture, to use immediate pattern recognition strategies, and to adjust the level of displayed detail to their particular needs. It could also help the user notice unanticipated patterns and to fluidly shift attention as understanding evolves.

J	Dickinson, DL; Kakoschke, N				Dickinson, David L.; Kakoschke, Naomi			Seeking confirmation? Biased information search and deliberation in the food domain	FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE			English	Article						Food choice; Dietary behaviour; Confirmation bias; Information search; Decision making; Cognitive dissonance	COGNITIVE-DISSONANCE; SELECTIVE EXPOSURE; CHOICE QUESTIONNAIRE; TASTE ATTITUDES; HEALTH; NUTRITION; BEHAVIOR; OBESITY; VALUES; CONSUMPTION	Individuals are often confronted with choosing between competing food attributes (e.g., healthiness vs. tastiness). To promote healthier food choices, is it important to understand what drives these choices. One potential driver of food choices is a confirmation bias, namely, a systematic bias in our approach to seeking information related to food attributes. This bias may generate avoidance of belief-disconfirming information and/or discounting of the value of belief-disconfirming arguments, both of which are documented in other domains (e.g., politics, religion). This study aimed to examine the confirmation bias in the food domain. We conducted an online study with a large sample (N = 427) stratified by sex and body mass index. Our sample, hypotheses, and analysis plan were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework. We measured pro-health and pro-taste food related information aimed at directly testing the presence of the confirmation bias in the food domain. We also examined whether higher deliberation (indexed by higher amount of thought, lower sleepiness, and higher cognitive reflection) modulated this bias. Results showed that individuals avoided exposure to information that promoted the food attribute that they utilized less (i.e., healthiness or tastiness). Furthermore, arguments promoting less used food attributes were perceived as weaker, and this effect was enhanced for more alert individuals (i.e., less sleepy). To our knowledge, these findings provide the first evidence for a confirmation bias in the food domain and suggest that unlike other cognitive biases, higher deliberation may enhance this bias. Marketing could focus efforts on convincing consumers that healthy food is tasty, rather than convincing them to care more about health.

This paper offers analysis of additional qualitative data from first-year college students reflecting on their high school preparation, levels of confidence regarding research and specific information literacy (IL) skills and how academic research differed from their previous inquiry experiences. Findings of this study hold implications for the instructional design of IL and underscore the need for heightened preparation in research and IL skills at the high school level and particularly for moving beyond the mechanics of research toward a focus on the critical thinking aspects of inquiry. Based on these findings, the researchers offer a three-part taxonomy of IL skills: information management, critical thinking, and metacognitive skills that could be used to guide the instructional design of IL at both the high school and college levels.

J	Chen, YC; Terada, T				Chen, Ying-Chih; Terada, Takeshi			Development and validation of an observation-based protocol to measure the eight scientific practices of the next generation science standards in K-12 science classrooms	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING			English	Article						Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive (ICAP) framework; observation-based protocol; professional development; scientific practice; validity	TEACHER PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; EXPLORATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICE; STUDENTS DEVELOPMENT; INSTRUMENT; FRAMEWORK; KNOWLEDGE; VALIDITY; QUALITY	The eight scientific practices in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are significant theoretical constructs that reflect the nature of science; they are intended to guide science teaching and learning. Yet, operationalization of these practices in terms of student learning remains limited, and a measurement tool for the eight practices is needed. Using an Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive (ICAP) theoretical framework, this study develops such a protocol, entitled ICAP to Measure by Observation NGSS Science Practice Implementation in the Classroom (IONIC). This protocol can be applied in K-12 science classrooms to determine the level of student engagement with the eight practices. Data were collected from 152 video-recorded lessons obtained after a 3-year professional development (PD) program designed to engage teachers to better understand and use the NGSS practices. We examined validity (content, face, translation, and construct) and reliability (internal and interrater) of IONIC. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to verify three competing theoretical models: Parsimonious (three phases of knowledge development: Investigation, Sensemaking, and Evaluating and Communicating, merged with the eight NGSS practices), NGSS (the eight practices), and Comprehensive. The latter consists of an upper-level (Parsimonious) and a lower-level (NGSS). The results suggest the Comprehensive Model is the preferred model among the three. In the upper-level, the score for Phase 3, Evaluating and communicating, is significantly lower than the other two. In the lower-level, classroom scores for Practice 5, Using mathematics and computational thinking, Practice 7, Engaging in argument from evidence, and Practice 8, Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information, are significantly lower than most of the others. Results of regression analyses suggest that the number of years the teacher participated in PD can predict student IONIC scores. The findings suggest that IONIC is a valid and reliable observation-based protocol, facilitating an understanding of how students can effectively engage in scientific practices in the classroom.

Superior individuals of the population that were suitable for the environment were retained during the evolution, and consequently the tolerable solutions could be obtained in the end. Despite the excellent performance of DE algorithm, there were still some shortcomings. For example, the general performance of DE depended largely on mutation strategy and control parameters, how to design the appropriate control parameters and mutation strategy were difficult tasks. Here a novel DE variant was proposed to overcome these shortcomings. By incorporating the depth information of previous generations of populations, a better diversity of trial vector candidates could be secured during the evolution process. Moreover, the thought that successful parameters should be retained to guide the update of themselves during the evolution was also incorporated into the novel algorithm. The optimization performance of the new proposed DE variant was verified under CEC 2013 test suit containing 28 benchmarks, and the results showed its competitiveness with several state-of-the-art DE variants.

To overcome these limitations, the basic Internet architecture has unleashed an unprecedented wave of innovation over the past decade, and introduced a promising networking paradigm, software-defined networking (SDN), often referred to as a "radical new idea in networking." SDN offers numerous potential benefits such as enhanced configuration, improved performance, and encouraged innovation in network architectures and operations, while undergoing unprecedented challenges due to the lack of global network-wide information. Nowadays, the emerging data-driven thought opens the era of the fourth paradigm for science research and transfers the design philosophy of future networks, based on the large-scale data rather than the small-scale data. We argue that the existence of a data-driven information plane in SDN can address these challenges. In this article, we explicitly propose a data-driven information plane and extend the SDN architecture specifically. We first overview the evolution of SDN, and then illustrate a novel SDN paradigm by introducing a data-driven information plane into the commonly accepted SDN reference architecture. Finally, we outline emerging challenges and discuss future directions for further research triggered by a data-driven information plane.

In many applications, such models will give reasonable approximations. However, they will often be found not to be entirely correct when enough data are at hand. A property of classical optimal design methodology is that the amount of data does not influence the design when a fixed model is used. However, it is reasonable that a low dimensional model is satisfactory only if limited data is available. With more data available, more aspects of the underlying relationship can be assessed. We consider a simple model that is not thought to be fully correct. The model misspecification, that is, the difference between the true mean and the simple model, is explicitly modeled with a stochastic process. This gives a unified approach to handle situations with both limited and rich data. Our objective is to estimate the combined model, which is the sum of the simple model and the assumed misspecification process. In our situation, the low-dimensional model can be viewed as a fixed effect and the misspecification term as a random effect in a mixed-effects model. Our aim is to predict within this model. We describe how we minimize the prediction error using an optimal design. We compute optimal designs for the full model in different cases. The results confirm that the optimal design depends strongly on the sample size. In low-information situations, traditional optimal designs for models with a small number of parameters are sufficient, while the inclusion of the misspecification term lead to very different designs in data-rich cases.

However, the post occupancy evaluation suggests many GB cannot well fulfill the expected targets. To overcome the mismatch among GB's multiobjectives, this paper develops an efficient and intelligent hybrid method using BIM-DesignBuilder (BIM-DB), Grey wolf optimization (GWO), random forest (RF) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to achieve the optimization of design parameters. The BIM model and DB simulation tool were used to obtain data samples of envelope and air conditioning system design parameters, and their life cycle carbon emission (LCCE), economic cost (EC) and predicted mean vote (PMV). The RF model was used to achieve high precision prediction. The GWO was used in the hyper-parameter optimization. The NSGA-II algorithm was applied to multi-objective optimization to obtain optimal design parameters. A building case shows: (1) The RF model had an excellent prediction performance for LCCE, EC and PMV. (2) BIM-DB can be used to obtain low error and high reliability building simulation data sets. (3) The RF-NSGA-II intelligent algorithm can reduce the LCCE of the building in the entire cycle by 16.6%, reduce the EC per square meter by 2.0%, and greatly improve the thermal comfort by 18.3%, representing good application value. This research provides a way of thinking for the multiobjective optimization of green buildings from the perspective of data mining and guidance for the parameter selection of the envelopes and air conditioning systems of new and existing buildings to more scientifically and effectively design green buildings.

Gradual accumulation of information during acting increases the DM quality reachable by an agent exploiting it. The inspected accumulation way uses a parametric model forecasting observable DM outcomes and updates the posterior pd of its unknown parameter. In the thought multi-agent case, a neighbouring agent, moreover, provides a privately-designed pd forecasting the same observation. This pd may notably enrich the information of the focal agent. Bayes' rule is a unique deductive tool for a lossless compression of the information brought by the observations. It does not suit to processing of the forecasting pd. The paper extends solutions of this case. It:. refines the Bayes'- rule-like use of the neighbour's forecasting pd. deductively complements former solutions so that the learnable neighbour's reliability can be taken into account. specialises the result to the exponential family, which shows the high potential of this information processing. cares about exploiting population statistics.

J	Swiecki, Z; Ruis, AR; Gautam, D; Rus, V; Shaffer, DW				Swiecki, Zachari; Ruis, Andrew R.; Gautam, Dipesh; Rus, Vasile; Shaffer, David Williamson			Understanding when students are active-in-thinking through modeling-in-context	BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							AUTOTUTOR	Learning-in-action depends on interactions with learning content, peers and real world problems. However, effective learning-in-action also depends on the extent to which students are active-in-thinking, making meaning of their learning experience. A critical component of any technology to support active thinking is the ability to ascertain whether (or to what extent) students have succeeded in internalizing the disciplinary strategies, norms of thinking, discourse practices and habits of mind that characterize deep understanding in a domain. This presents what we call a dilemma of modeling-in-context: teachers routinely analyze this kind of thinking for small numbers of students in activities they create or customize for the needs of their students; however, doing so at scale and in real-time requires some automated processes for modeling student work. Current techniques for developing models that reflect specific pedagogical activities and learning objectives that a teacher might create require either more expertise or more time than teachers have. In this paper, we examine a theoretical approach to addressing the problem of modeling active thinking in its pedagogical context that uses teacher-created rubrics to generate models of student work. The results of this examination show how appropriately constructed learning technologies can enable teachers to develop custom automated rubrics for modeling active thinking and meaning-making from the records of students' dialogic work. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Many immersive educational technologies, such as digital games and simulations, enable students to take consequential action in a realistic context and to interact with peers, mentors and pedagogical agents. Such technologies help students to be active-in-thinking: engaging deeply with, reflecting on and otherwise making meaning of their learning experience. There are now many immersive educational technologies with integrated authoring tools that enable teachers to customize the learning experience with relative ease, reducing barriers to adoption and improving student learning. Educational technologies that support learning-in-action typically contain student models that operate in real-time to control the behavior of pedagogical agents, deliver just-in-time interventions, select an appropriate content or otherwise measure and promote active thinking, but these student models may not work appropriately if teachers customize the learning experience. Much as there are authoring tools that allow teachers to customize the curriculum of a given learning technology, there is a need for authoring tools that allow teachers to customize the associated student models as well. What this paper adds This paper presents a novel, rubric-based approach to develop automated student models for new activities that teachers develop in digital learning environments that promote active thinking. Our approach combines machine learning techniques with teacher expertise, allowing teachers to participate in the design of automated student models of active thinking that with further development could be scaled by leveraging their skills in rubric development. Our results show that a rubric-based approach can outperform a machine learning approach in this context. More importantly, in some cases, the rubric-based approach can produce reliable automated models based on the information that a teacher can easily provide. Implications for practice and/or policy If integrated into authoring tools, the rubric-based approach could allow teachers to participate in the design of automated models for educational technologies customized to their instructional needs. Through this design process, teachers could develop a better understanding of how the automated modeling system works, which in turn could increase the adoption of educational technologies that promote active thinking. Because the rubric-based approach enables teachers to identify key connections among concepts relevant to the pedagogical context, rather than general concepts or linguistic features, it is more likely to facilitate targeted feedback to help promote the development of active thinking.

The majority of researchers have used film-based simulations to capture superior performance. We combined eye movement recording and verbal reports of thinking to explore the processes underpinning skilled performance in a complex, dynamic, and externally paced representative volleyball task involving in situ data collection. Altogether, 27 female volleyball players performed as centre backcourt defenders in simulated sessions while wearing an eye-tracking device. After each sequence, athletes were questioned concerning their perception of the situation. The visual search strategies employed by the highly-skilled players were more exploratory than those used by skilled players, involving more fixations to a greater number of locations. Highly-skilled participants spent more time fixating on functional spaces between two or more display areas, while the skilled participants fixated on the ball trajectory and specific players. Moreover, highly-skilled players generated more condition concepts with higher levels of sophistication than their skilled counterparts. Findings highlight the value of using representative task designs to capture performance in situ.

The development and maintenance of libraries for these architectures is simply too complex to be amenable to conventional approaches to implementation. Attempts to employ traditional methodology have led, in our opinion, to the production of an abundance of anfractuous code that is difficult to maintain and almost impossible to upgrade. Having struggled with these issues for more than a decade, we have concluded that a solution is to apply a technique from theoretical computer science, formal derivation, to the development of high-performance linear algebra libraries. We think the resulting approach results in aesthetically pleasing, coherent code that greatly facilitates intelligent modularity and high performance while enhancing confidence in its correctness. Since the technique is language-independent, it lends itself equally well to a wide spectrum of programming languages (and paradigms) ranging from C and Fortran to C++ and Java. In this paper, we illustrate our observations by looking at the Formal Linear Algebra Methods Environment (FLAME), a framework that facilitates the derivation and implementation of linear algebra algorithms on sequential architectures. This environment demonstrates that lessons learned in the distributed-memory world can guide us toward better approaches even in the sequential world. We present performance experiments on the Intel (R) Pentium (R) III processor that demonstrate that high performance can be attained by coding at a high level of abstraction.

Through a design-based research framework, we developed a model-based assessment (MBA) and associated rubric as tools for teachers to understand and support students in their conceptualization of the flow of energy and matter within ecosystems. The MBA was piloted with four middle school students (n = 4) and implemented in two sixth grade student cohorts (n = 89 & n = 98). The MBA and rubrics went through several design iterations in order to best capture student understanding of complex systems. The design of the MBA allows students to express conceptual understanding while also capturing the transformation of their understanding as they are exposed to new information and experiences within the curricular content.

Integrating the Climate Science Modelling Language with geospatial software and services	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH			English	Article						climate; modelling; schema; standards; data; interoperability		Much consideration is rightly given to the design of metadata models to describe data. At the other end of the data-delivery spectrum much thought has also been given to the design of geospatial delivery interfaces such as the Open Geospatial Consortium standards, Web Coverage Service (WCS), Web Map Server and Web Feature Service (WFS). Our recent experience with the Climate Science Modelling Language shows that an implementation gap exists where many challenges remain unsolved. To bridge this gap requires transposing information and data from one world view of geospatial climate data to another. Some of the issues include: the loss of information in mapping to a common information model, the need to create 'views' onto file-based storage, and the need to map onto an appropriate delivery interface (as with the choice between WFS and WCS for feature types with coverage-valued properties). Here we summarise the approaches we have taken in facing up to these problems.

J	Syed, R; Dhillon, G; Merrick, J				Syed, Romilla; Dhillon, Gurpreet; Merrick, Jason			The Identity Management Value Model: A Design Science Approach to Assess Value Gaps on Social Media	DECISION SCIENCES			English	Article							VALUE-FOCUSED THINKING; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; NETWORKING SITES; SECURITY; IDENTIFICATION; TECHNOLOGY; PRIVACY; SELF; ELICITATION; PERSPECTIVE	Threats to the individual identity on social media are real and problematic. Yet, there is a paucity of research on online identity management. We posit that identity management on social media requires a value perspective to determine gaps between what social media users want from online identity management and what social media sites offer through their current security and privacy controls. Following the design science research paradigm, we present an Identity Management Value Model (IMVM). Based on multiple-objectives decision analysis technique, the value model explicates a hierarchy of fundamental identity management objectives and quantifies the achievement of objectives on a social media site. The emergent value scores and value gaps provide an understanding of how well a social media site manages users online identity. We demonstrate the application of the value model for Facebook and assess a set of measures to reduce the value gaps on Facebook. We conducted sensitivity analysis followed by deterministic analysis to evaluate the value model. The evaluation results indicate that the modeling outcome is robust to a range of individual values and preferences. By focusing on individual values, this study extends the research on values in the context of identity management on social media. Social media companies might find the model useful for instituting identity management measures. Individual users could use the model for strategizing about personal identity management. Our study also demonstrates the usefulness of a retrospective design approach, accounting for user values in a principled and comprehensive manner.

Research suggests active learning is an effective method for teaching and learning in the engineering classroom. Moreover, students continue to express increased satisfaction when taught using this experiential pedagogical approach. One approach to active learning gaining traction in the engineering classroom is the use of online discussions. The purpose of this paper is to offer a structured approach for engineering educators to develop online discussion prompts aimed to prepare engineering students for entering the workforce; this structure approach includes an intentional and purposeful focus on three core elements: (1) interdisciplinary viewpoints, (2) real-world and authentic experiences, and (3) information literacy applications. A mixed methods analysis provides evidence towards student exposure and awareness to the three core elements of interdisciplinary viewpoints, real world and authentic experiences, and information literacy applications. In addition, students reported a positive experience participating in online discussions, and improvements in student perception changes related to blended learning and self-regulated learning.

With the first and third dimensions in mind, we explore how AOT influences trust in public health experts, risk perceptions, and compliance with recommended behaviors aimed at slowing the spread and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using survey data from a nationally representative sample of Americans (N = 857), we tested whether AOT will lead people to place greater trust public health experts (H1). Because these experts have been consistently messaging that COVID-19 is a real and serious threat to public health, we also hypothesized that trust in experts would be positively associated with high perceived risk (H2), which should have a positive influence on (self-reported) compliance with CDC recommendations (H3). And because AOT is a self-directed thinking style, we also expected it to directly influence risk perceptions and, by extension, compliance (H4). Our results support all four hypotheses. We discuss the implications of these results for how risk communication and risk management efforts are designed and practiced.

The knowledge-learning model based on verbal instruction, used in traditional classrooms, does not make use of real-life situations that encourage students to engage in reflective learning. However, by implementing the Ubiquitous Situated Reflective Learning System (USRLS), learners can be provided with real situations, faced in daily life at any time, to encourage them to engage in reflective learning with regard to information pertinent to the class. This study adopted a quasi-experimental design to assess the efficacy of these two learning models. The research subjects were 52 students from two grade 5 classes in one elementary school in the middle part of Taiwan. The USRLS was used for teaching the experimental group, while the traditional oral teaching method was used for the control group. The learning content of fifth-grade life-science technology classes consists of units on burning and rusting in the context of the life sciences and technology. The research results showed that (1) the learning effectiveness of the USRLS is superior to that of the traditional oral teaching model and (2) students in the high-learning achievement (HLA) group are best suited to a text-based self-reflective learning strategy, while students in the low-learning achievement (LLA) group can obtain more help by using a text-based peer-reflective strategy. Students noted that the learning cycle of a situated reflective learning model encouraged them to consider lesson content, helped them review their answers, and enabled them to increase their focus on the concepts and information in the learning task.

The IPS-1-model is based on three studies, in which students in secondary and (post) higher education were asked to solve information problems, while thinking aloud. In-depth analyses of the thinking-aloud protocols revealed that the IPS-process consists of five constituent skills: (a) defining information problem, (b) searching information, (c) scanning information, (d) processing information, and (e) organizing and presenting information. Further, the studies revealed that regulation skills prove to be crucial for the on-going IPS-process. The IPS-1-model depicts the constituent skills, regulation skills, and important conditional skills. The model gives an initial impetus for designing IPS-instruction. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Baek, S; Kim, S				Baek, Suhyun; Kim, Sunah			Participatory Public Service Design by Gov.3.0 Design Group	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						participatory policy; citizen-centered; citizen participation; citizen orientation	GOVERNANCE	Citizen satisfaction levels with public service have become a key indicator in evaluating a nation's policy capability; as such, it has become important to realize citizen-centered public service that enhances the satisfaction of citizens. Governments need to adopt new and creative methods to respond to changes and redefine the conditions of their policy processes. This study reviews the effectiveness of utilizing open innovation by design thinking for policy processes, and aims to detail the conditions for a policy process geared towards citizen-centered public service. The study reviews open innovation as a means of overcoming the insular tendencies of organizations, and also reviews the advantages of design thinking in identifying the diversified needs of citizens and coordinating their interests. Based on those, we conducted a case study and applied open innovation by design thinking for policy processes. The results revealed that key conditions include cooperation among designers, the diversification of communication channels between internal and external organizations, the joining of citizen experiences, repeated verification of citizen needs, and visualization of the whole progression. Such conditions are principal factors that contribute to citizen orientation and participation, and are expected to play a conducive role in the realization of citizen-centered public service in the future.

To enable students to have more practicing time under the supervision of trainers in class, flipped learning has been adopted to shift the lecture time to the before-class stage, and hence more time is available for in-class practicing. Although flipped learning has been recognized by scholars as an effective teaching mode, researchers have also indicated the challenges of implementing it; in particular, many students have difficulty learning before the class on their own. In this research, a self-regulated flipped learning approach was proposed to cope with this problem by guiding students to set their learning goals, and supporting them in monitoring their learning status in five stages, namely, goal setting, flipped learning (including pre-class video-based instruction and in-class discussion), task sharing, self-evaluation, and self-regulation feedback. In addition, an experiment was conducted in a professional training program to examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach. From the experimental results, it was found that the approach significantly improved the students' learning achievement, self-efficacy, self-regulation, and critical thinking, which could be a good reference for future research related to flipped professional training.

Adopting an information processing perspective, it gathers objective and self-reported measures and investigates the relationships between them. Design/methodology/approach - An experiment was conducted with a sample of 174 individuals. The presence of a symbol recommending the product or signalling its popularity within the website was manipulated. Participants' need for cognition was measured. Findings - The presence of a product symbol positively influenced users' cognitive elaboration and perceptions of information diagnosticity. Significant differences of situational and individual characteristics, related to the type of symbol and the users' motivation to process information, were detected. Research limitations/implications - Dual information processing theories represent an adequate framework to analyse the ways in which online users perceive and process product symbols, and how they incorporate them into their diagnosticity perceptions. The presence and type of product symbols operate through different mechanisms depending on the user's need for cognition. Web designers should consider displaying these cues in online product presentations, given their potential to improve the quality of consumers' thoughts and diagnosticity perceptions. Originality/value - This is one of the first studies which examines how product symbols affect online users' information processing and evaluations. The paper offers a complete view of online information search behaviour by gathering users' objective and self-reported measures. In addition the paper stresses the importance of contextual variables related to the messages and individual's characteristics.

Essentially, we propose that researchers collect implementation data early in the research pipeline, in situations where they might not typically be thinking about implementation science. We describe three broad contextual scenarios through which the observational-implementation hybrid approach would most productively be applied. The first ap-plication is for observational cohorts that individually enroll participants-either for existing (to which im-plementation concepts could be added) or for newly planned studies. The second application is with routinely collected program data, at either the individual or aggregate levels. The third application is to the collection of data from study participants enrolled in an observational cohort study who are also involved in interventions linked to that study (e.g., collecting data about their experiences with those interventions). Examples of relevant implementation data that could be collected as part of observational studies include factors relevant to transportability, participant preferences, and participant/provider perspectives regarding interventions and implementation strategies. The observational-implementation hybrid model provides a practical approach to make the research pipeline more efficient and to decrease the time from observational research to health impact. If this approach is widely adopted, observational and implementation science studies will become more integrated; this will likely lead to new collaborations, will encourage the expansion of epidemiological training, and, we hope, will push both epidemiologists and implementation scientists to increase the public health impact of their work.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Understanding views on everyday use of personal health information: Insights from community dwelling older adults	INFORMATICS FOR HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE			English	Article						Healthy aging; older adults; personal health information management; stakeholder engagement; wellness	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; AGING IN-PLACE; INVISIBLE WORK; SYSTEM MODEL; MANAGEMENT; HOME; SUPPORT; ENVIRONMENT; TECHNOLOGY; ACCEPTANCE	Background: Older adults apply various strategies to pursue healthy aging, but we know little about their views and use of personal health information to accomplish those ends. Methods: As a first step in formulating the role of personal health information management (PHIM) in healthy aging, we explored the perspectives of older adults on health and health information used in their everyday lives through four focus groups with 25 community-dwelling adults aged 60 and over. Results: We found that the concept of wellness-the holistic and multidimensional nature of health and wellbeing-plays prominently in how older adults think about health and health information. Participants expressed wellness from a position of personal strength, rather than health-related deficits, by focusing on wellness activities for staying healthy through: (1) personal health practices, (2) social network support, and (3) residential community engagement. Conclusion: Although these themes involve personal health information, existing PHIM systems that focus on disease management are generally not designed to support wellness activities. Substantial opportunity exists to fill this wellness support gap with innovative health information technology designed for older adults. Findings carry implications for the design of PHIM tools that support healthy aging and methods for engaging older adults as co-producers of this critical support.	[Hartzler, A.

FOREWORD	HASTINGS CENTER REPORT			English	Editorial Material								How should we think about synthetic biologyabout the potential benefits and risks of these applications as well as the very idea of designed, extensively genetically modified organisms? The lead article in this report sets out our thinking, but the article is rounded out with nine commentaries that sometimes expand on and sometimes argue with our perspective. Jonathan Wolff, a philosopher at the University College of London and a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, and Mark Bedau, a philosopher at Reed College and a participant in several projects aimed at developing artificial cells, discuss the potential consequences of synthetic biology and suggest some reasons for a precautionary approach to deliberating about the consequences. Jane Calvert, reader in science, technology, and innovation studies at the University of Edinburgh and a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics working party on emerging biotechnologies, recommends, however, that deliberation about the governance of emerging technologies focus less on consequences than on aims and purposes.Gigi Gronvall, senior associate at the Center for Health Security in the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and David Relman, a microbiologist and immunologist at the Stanford School of Medicine, offer contrasting perspectives about a question we raise concerning the ethics of knowledgethe values at stake in generating and disseminating potentially dangerous information. Gaymon Bennett offers some ruminations on the questions we raise about how synthetic biology might change the human relationship to nature in morally significant ways. He argues, too, that we can think about the ethics of synthetic biology more effectively by getting upstream in another wayby sitting next to the bioengineers doing the work and studying their everyday practice rather than by paying attention only to what is thought and said about their work. Colleen Grogan, professor at the University of Chicago's School of Social Administration and an expert on democratic participatory processes in governance, builds on our comments about the challenge of creating a meaningful public dialog about synthetic biology. Jim Thomas, a researcher with the ETC Group, challenges our view of how the public debate about synthetic biology is trending. And Sarah Carter, a policy analyst with the J. Craig Venter Institute, puts our discussion about synthetic biology in the context of debates about other new products and technologies.

They have to allow detailed documentation and must be user-friendly. State-of-the-art applications for design permit clinicians themselves to create their own forms as needed, with the various variables presented in different ways depending on their intended use. Often, however, only aspects of clinical documentation are considered, with no thought being given to subsequent data retrieval. This article presents guidelines for the retrieval-oriented design of clinical forms. It discusses where anticipatory measures for structuring forms are easier to accomplish than complex data linkage at the time of retrieval and analysis.

Heuristic Thinking in Patient Care	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						heuristics; attribute substitution; operational performance; hospitals	LENGTH-OF-STAY; RISK-FACTORS; BOUNDED RATIONALITY; 30-DAY READMISSION; NEWSVENDOR PROBLEM; EXPERIENCE; CAPACITY; PSYCHOLOGY; ECONOMICS; LESS	This paper studies heuristic thinking and cognitive bias using a natural experiment from the field. The setting for the study is a set of acute care hospitals, where we examine the care process and discharge decisions for individual patients. Determining a patient's suitability for discharge is cognitively taxing, calling for the decision maker to draw on up-to-date clinical expertise and detailed information. We postulate that bounded rationality in decision making can lead the care provider to substitute clinical readiness for discharge, a more cognitively complex attribute, with the observed days spent in the hospital, a more easily accessible heuristic. Identifying the use of the heuristic is challenging, as patient readiness for discharge is often correlated with the time spent in the hospital. Our identification strategy, motivated by regression discontinuity design, exploits a discontinuity associated with the admission process at midnight. On the basis of more than 177,000 patient discharges spanning eight years, we find support for the use of the heuristic: 19.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) [14.6%, 23.8%]) of patients incur an increased length of stay by a day on average as a result of the heuristic. We also find that the reliance on the heuristic is associated with overtreatment; postmidnight patients on average cost $512 (95% CI [$100, $923]) more but without any corresponding improvement in healthcare outcomes. A counterfactual analysis shows that eliminating the heuristic lowers the bed capacity needed to maintain the same patient throughput. For example, for a hospital unit in our study with a bed capacity of 106, eliminating the heuristic would allow the hospital to maintain the same throughput with 1.61 fewer beds on average. These findings have a number of implications for policy formulation and managerial decision making.	[Diwas Singh, K.

Design Q-methodology approach alongside a think-aloud process. Using a vignette outlining a hypothetical trial, participants were asked to rank statements about informational items usually included in a participant information leaflet (PIL) on a Q-grid, while undertaking a real-time think-aloud process to elicit the underpinning decision processes. Analysis of quantitative data was conducted using descriptive statistics and qualitative data was coded using content analysis. Participants 20 participants (10 potential trial participants and 10 research nurses). Setting UK-based participants. Results Ten research nurses and 10 potential trial participants provided data for the study. Both stakeholder groups ranked similar statements in their top three most important statements, with What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?' featuring in both. However, considerable variability existed between the groups with regard to their ranking of statements of least importance. Participants identified that sufficient information to make a decision was secured using around 14 items. Participants also identified other items of importance not routinely included in PILs. Conclusions This study has provided a unique insight into how and why different trial stakeholder groups rank informational items currently contained within PILs. These results have implications for those developing future PILs and those who develop guidance on their content; PILs should focus most on the information items that potential trial participants want and need to make an informed choice about trial participation.

J	Hubbard, RJ; Sahakyan, L				Hubbard, Ryan J.; Sahakyan, Lili			Differential Recruitment of Inhibitory Control Processes by Directed Forgetting and Thought Substitution	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; forgetting; inhibition; memory	STOP-SIGNAL; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; MECHANISMS SUPPORT; UNWANTED MEMORIES; NEURAL MECHANISMS; SUPPRESSION; ERP; TESTS; BENEFITS; TUTORIAL	Humans have the ability to intentionally forget information via different strategies, included suppression of encoding (directed forgetting) and mental replacement of the item to encode (thought substitution). These strategies may rely on dif-ferent neural mechanisms; namely, encoding suppression may induce prefrontally mediated inhibition, whereas thought sub-stitution is potentially accomplished through modulating contextual representations. Yet, few studies have directly related inhibitory processing to encoding suppression, or tested its involvement in thought substitution. Here, we directly tested whether encoding suppression recruits inhibitory mechanisms with a cross-task design, relating the behavioral and neural data from male and female participants in a Stop Signal task (a task specifically testing inhibitory processing) to a directed forgetting task with both encoding suppression (Forget) and thought substitution (Imagine) cues. Behaviorally, Stop Signal task performance (stop signal reaction times) was related to the magnitude of encoding suppression, but not thought substi-tution. Two complementary neural analyses corroborated the behavioral result. Namely, brain-behavior analysis demonstrated that the magnitude of right-frontal beta activity following stop signals was related to stop signal reaction times and successful encoding suppression, but not thought substitution; and classifiers trained to discriminate successful and unsuccessful stop-ping in the Stop Signal task could also classify successful and unsuccessful forgetting following Forget cues, but not Imagine cues. Importantly, inhibitory neural mechanisms were engaged following Forget cues at a later time than motor stopping. These findings not only support an inhibitory account of directed forgetting, and that thought substitution engages separate mechanisms, but also potentially identify a specific time in which inhibition occurs when suppressing encoding.

Reflect-Express-Transform: Investigating Speech-Based Iterative Digital Design for Young Designers	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						computer-aided design; human computer interfaces/interactions; speech-based interface/interactions; iterative design; conceptual design	LANGUAGE; VERBALIZATION; CONVERSATION; METHODOLOGY; GENERATION; SKETCH	We investigate speech-based input as a means to enable reflective thinking for younger individuals (middle- and high-school students) during design iterations. Verbalization offers a unique way to externalize ideas in early design and could therefore lead to new pathways for exploration and iteration, especially for K-12 students who possess the creative potential but are not technically trained in the design process. Interactive design systems, however, by-and-large utilize sketching, multitouch, and gestural inputs. As a result, (1) there is little know-how regarding how to operationalize verbal inputs as a meaningful way to facilitate idea exploration and (2) there is little fundamental understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms for iteration through verbal communication. We take the initial steps toward these gaps by first designing and implementing the ShapOrator interface that takes verbal descriptions of geometric parameters (shape, size, instances) in a semi-natural language form and determines the appropriate transformations to a given design artifact modeled as a shape assembly. By using ShapOrator as our experimental setup, we conducted an in-depth observational study on ten middle- and high-school students tasked with designing spaceships. Our study revealed that participants were able to create a variety of designs while associating functional and topical contexts to their spaceships throughout the design iteration process.

J	Roberts, M; Allen, S; Coley, D				Roberts, Matthew; Allen, Stephen; Coley, David			Life cycle assessment in the building design process - A systematic literature review	BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Life cycle assessment; Building; Net zero carbon; Early-stage design; Environmental design; Whole life carbon	EMBODIED ENERGY; ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT; CARBON FOOTPRINT; CO2 EMISSIONS; EARLY-STAGE; LCA; BIM; IMPACTS; CONSTRUCTION	Buildings contribute a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions and have the potential for large-scale impact reductions. Reducing the whole-life impacts of buildings is critical for creating a net-zero carbon built environment. For this to be achieved, the whole-life carbon impacts of design decisions must be considered during the building design process. A systematic review of academic literature was conducted to assess how life cycle assessment (LCA) is incorporated at various stages of the building design process, and what improvements are needed to support net-zero carbon design. The review compiled 274 papers that were published up to the end of 2019, of which 108 were subject to detailed review following screening. The review found that LCA is generally used late in the design process, when it is too late to greatly influence the design. Incorporating LCA with either building information modelling or life cycle costing is seen to have the same challenges as undertaking a traditional LCA. Parametric methods show promise for design development, but tools and algorithms require further verification and regionalisation to be implemented throughout industry. The use of benchmarks, target values and other pre-populated information can be used to incorporate life-cycle thinking without the need to undertake a detailed LCA. The review has demonstrated that LCA continues to face barriers, in both methods and practice, preventing its ability to guide early-stage design decisions and have a large impact on the environmental performance of buildings.

Perspectives on context, design teams and diffusion of technological innovations in low-resource settings: A practical approach based on sub-Saharan African projects	TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Technological innovations; Sustainable development; Developing countries; Design teams; Poverty alleviation; Food and energy security	COUNTRIES	A human-centered design approach for creating science/engineering-driven solutions or innovations, referred to as "connect-the-dots," is presented. Dots symbolize the best questions and the connections reveal the best order in which these questions should be answered. In this approach, the number of customer or user behavioral changes are critically analyzed, revealing the overall context in which the solution or innovation will operate; especially to undergraduate students creating solutions to problems from settings that are less familiar, from cultural, economic, and geopolitical viewpoints. Solutions or innovations that result in minimal user behavior changes are preferred. Additional benefits include better incorporation of systems theory thinking, ease with which team multidisciplinarity and diversity can be identified, and seamlessly integrating design and research.

Since the practice of information education, the entire education environment is largely changed and the knowledge source is expanded to the more comprehensive and multiple computer multimedia network world. Rich resources and the importance of international tactic of oceans are extremely emphasised globally. Countries with sea power work hard on promoting the national education of marine resources, marine environment, and marine protection, expecting to root the marine education knowledge, sustainably develop marine ecological resources, and remain the life and growth of marine species. Taking students as the research subject, experimental design model is applied to the quasi-experimental research in this study. Total 238 college students in Guangdong Province are preceded the information teaching style experiment with computer multimedia for 16 weeks (3 h per week for total 48 h). The research results show positive effects of information teaching styles on ecological conservation knowledge and attitudes towards ecological conservation as well as significantly positive effects of ecological conservation knowledge on environmental value and environmental belief in attitudes towards ecological conservation. Suggestions are further proposed according to the results, expecting to promote the emphasis and implementation of domestic marine ecology education policies and deepen the citizens marine thinking, knowledge, and action to promote the overall national marine literacy.

Data sharing, management, use, and reuse: Practices and perceptions of scientists worldwide	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Background With data becoming a centerpiece of modern scientific discovery, data sharing by scientists is now a crucial element of scientific progress. This article aims to provide an in-depth examination of the practices and perceptions of data management, including data storage, data sharing, and data use and reuse by scientists around the world. Methods The Usability and Assessment Working Group of DataONE, an NSF-funded environmental cyberinfrastructure project, distributed a survey to a multinational and multidisciplinary sample of scientific researchers in a two-waves approach in 2017-2018. We focused our analysis on examining the differences across age groups, sub-disciplines of science, and sectors of employment. Findings Most respondents displayed what we describe as high and mediocre risk data practices by storing their data on their personal computer, departmental servers or USB drives. Respondents appeared to be satisfied with short-term storage solutions; however, only half of them are satisfied with available mechanisms for storing data beyond the life of the process. Data sharing and data reuse were viewed positively: over 85% of respondents admitted they would be willing to share their data with others and said they would use data collected by others if it could be easily accessed. A vast majority of respondents felt that the lack of access to data generated by other researchers or institutions was a major impediment to progress in science at large, yet only about a half thought that it restricted their own ability to answer scientific questions. Although attitudes towards data sharing and data use and reuse are mostly positive, practice does not always support data storage, sharing, and future reuse. Assistance through data managers or data librarians, readily available data repositories for both long-term and short-term storage, and educational programs for both awareness and to help engender good data practices are clearly needed.

The authors collaborated with university science instructors to design and integrate a news literacy curriculum into a set of learning activities to promote critical thinking and research skills. A qualitative analysis of 108 students' written essays presents empirical evidence of their perceptions of fake news in terms of content (what), purpose (why), and source (who). The results show that students primarily sought news from traditional sources, such as CNN, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and the New York Times, while working on their research assignments. They spent, on average, about 7 hours per week reading, watching, or listening to news while taking the online course. More than half the students indicated that they used mobile devices to browse news most of the time. The strategies and tools the students used to manage multiple news sources are discussed.

J	Ramírez, R				Ramírez, R			A model for rural and remote information and communication technologies:: a Canadian exploration	TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY			English	Article						model; rural; remote; ICTs; Canada; case studies; systems thinking	TELECOMMUNICATIONS; DIFFUSION; SOCIETY	While Canada boasts one of the most advanced information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures, its rural and remote areas are lagging behind. Rural and remote ICTs development is presented as an uncharted domain. A model for rural and remote ICTs is proposed describing the interrelationships among policy, organizational, community, and technological dimensions. The model served as a guide to prepare three case studies that are briefly described. Several principles are described as strategic policy and organizational insights into how rural and remote communities can harness ICTs. The article concludes with a hypothesis highlighting the role of mediating organizations to secure affordable and relevant ICT services and applications for rural and remote communities.

Existing research shows how descriptive norms that provide decision-makers with information about how others decide in a given context, can encourage more sustainable choices among users. Research described in this article shows that descriptive norms can encourage more sustainable choices among designers of civil infrastructure. We asked research participants to complete a simulated design exercise after randomly assigning them to either a modified version of the Envision rating system for sustainable infrastructure (with a positive descriptive norm reflecting high sustainability performance among other designers) or the current version of Envision (with no descriptive norm). Participants exposed to the positive descriptive norm set goals that resulted on average in 28% more sustainability points than a control group. A positive descriptive norm, in addition to being effective by itself, also added to the effect of other choice architecture interventions (defaults and role model project) known to increase sustainability goals. These results show a specific example and the potential for widespread use of descriptive norms in choice architecture interventions to support design for greater sustainability in civil infrastructure.

Building on a long disciplinary tradition of conceptualizing and studying 'nursing environment', the past twenty years has witnessing the establishment and refinement of explicitly geographical nursing research. This article - part one in a series of two - reviews the perspectives taken to date, ranging from historical precedent in classical nursing theory through to positivistic spatial science, political economy, and social constructivism in contemporary inquiry. This discussion sets up part two, which considers the potential of non-representational theory for framing future studies.

The involvement of end users throughout the design process of eIC is of utmost importance to improve the current informed consent process. Methods Using a provocative design, we conducted interviews with 30 clinical research participants. Provotypes were used as a starting base to discuss various aspects relevant to eIC. By providing a medium to encourage divergent thinking, participants' views and concerns were solicited. Thematic analysis was undertaken using NVivo. Results The majority of participants placed trust in the principal investigator or the hospital to perform the role of eIC hosting party. Differing opinions were reported on the amount of information required related to stakeholders' access to an eIC system, and thus, to participants' personal data, to enable trust in an eIC system. Nevertheless, this study indicates a general willingness of participants to share personal data with physicians and pharmaceutical companies on an international level, and to receive requests for new research studies via an eIC system. Participants suggested to tailor an eIC system based upon their preferences, for example, regarding whom they want to share their personal data with. Moreover, they expressed a desire to choose how they can contact the research team, and to indicate which study-related information they would like to receive electronically. In addition, positive opinions were voiced on the integration of a test to assess participants' understanding before providing their eIC. Conclusions Following a research through design approach, insights have been generated which inform the design of eIC. Provotypes were designed to help participants think beyond what is familiar to them. Study findings revealed that not all situations were perceived as provocative, because of participants' motivation to advance scientific research and the trust they place in the research team. Nevertheless, the use of provocative design resulted in additional insights, generated by clinical research participants, which could be considered in the further design of eIC.

J	Bigirimana, S				Bigirimana, Stanislas			Beyond the thinking and doing dichotomy: integrating individual and institutional rationality	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Information theory; Cybernetics; Dynamic and integrative epistemology; Insight; Institutional Rationality; Lonergan		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce a dynamic and integrative epistemology as a substitute to normative epistemology. Design/methodology/approach - A philosophical argument based on the critique of literature. Findings - Normative epistemology implies that knowing leads to certainty, and it has to be objective and universal because it is an accurate representation of reality. Dynamic and integrative epistemology uphold that knowing leads to accumulating insights though information processing. Knowing is a unified but fourfold process of experiencing, understanding, judging and acting (Lonergan, 1990). It occurs at four levels of consciousness: the empirical, the intellectual, the evaluative and the pragmatic (Lonergan, 1990). Dynamic and integrative epistemology extends rationality, knowledge and intelligence to non-humans because institutions have substantive, structural, behavior and teleological dimensions and processes that enable themto process information, i. e. to know. Research limitations/implications - Translating a conceptual paper into practical action, organizational structuring or product design can be difficult. Practical implications - Extending the concept of rationality to non-humans implies realizing that human abilities are limited and need to be augmented by proper institutional design and artificial tools. Social implications - The design of intelligent organizations, societies and artificial tools. Originality value - Normative epistemology which considers reason and faith, empirical (experience) and rational (understanding), positive (facts) and ideal (principles, representations or wishes), physical (objects) and "mental" (ideas or concepts), practice and theory, knowledge (episteme) and opinion (doxa), reflection and action as opposed and mutually exclusive can be replaced by a dynamic and integrative epistemology which puts emotional, intellectual, evaluative and pragmatic dimensions of human knowing in an order of succession through a unified but yet differentiated process which can be augmented by non-human "experts".

As a fast and nondestructive technique, NIR has been widely accepted. The diffuse reflection light is detected after interaction with sample. Generally, it is thought that the light carries the interior information of sample, but no one can definitely depict how much information of inner sample can be collected. In the present study, three kinds of flue-cured tobacco were used to design our tests. Each kind of tobacco was prepared in two forms, slice and powder. Then we got three slice tobacco samples and three powder tobacco samples. Every experimental sample consisted of one slice tobacco and one powder tobacco. The slice tobacco was put in the bottom of the sample-cup and the powder tobacco was placed on top of the slice tobacco. Combining different slice tobaccos with different powder tobaccos, the authors can get nine experimental samples. Every experimental sample was scanned from the bottom of the sample-cup for each sample using Bruker MPA FT-NIR instrument four times repeatedly, then we got 36 pieces of NIR spectra totally. In order to find the relationship between the deep light penetration and variance contribution rate of different principal components (PC) of NIR spectra, cluster analysis was carried out using different combination of PC. When the first and second PC were chosen, the samples were clustered according to the exterior slice tobacco; Using the third and fourth PC, the samples were clustered according to the interior powder tobacco. Combining the variance contribution rates of different PC, we could elementarily describe NIR spectra information composition according to the path length of the light penetration quantitatively. Results showed that the first and the second PC contained about 98% spectra information which represented the exterior information, and the third and the fourth PC contained about 1.5% which represented the interior information of the sample. These results can help us profoundly understand the importance of PC selection in NIR qualitative and quantitative analysis.

According to the on-line questionnaire, 80% of students in 2010-2012 replied that the lecture was useful for their future career. The task given to students was to design and realise an autonomous electronic information devices (so-called the IoT-gadgets') by themselves, and conduct a live demonstration in front of their colleagues. The device must have an input', output', and some information processing'. Being aware of the speed of technology evolution as well as the short hours of the lecture, the professor tried not to give direct answers to students' questions on how-to instantly build and program an information device. Instead, the students were told to beware of their methods'. This refers to the deductive thinking introduced by Rene Descartes, and in the lecture's context how students should behave in order to realise the device. In this study, the backgrounds of various associated topics are discussed, such as the UTokyo's educational system, the world's rapid prototyping movement, open hardware, course design, students' reactions, and future directions.

Copolymers represent a key example, where simple homopolymers have given rise to random, alternating, gradient, and block copolymers. Polymer physics has provided the insight needed to explore this monomer sequence parameter space. The future of polymer science, however, must contend with further increases in monomer precision, as this class of macromolecules moves ever closer to the sequence-monodisperse polymers that are the workhorses of biology. The advent of sequence-defined polymers gives rise to opportunities for material design, with increasing levels of chemical information being incorporated into long-chain molecules; however, this also raises questions that polymer physics must address. What properties uniquely emerge from sequence-definition? Is this circumstance-dependent? How do we define and think about sequence dispersity? How do we think about a hierarchy of sequence effects? Are more sophisticated characterization methods, as well as theoretical and computational tools, needed to understand this class of macromolecules? The answers to these questions touch on many difficult scientific challenges, setting the stage for a rich future for sequence-defined polymers in polymer physics.

J	Turgay, O				Turgay, Orkunt			The Meaning of Studio Practice Over Shadowed by Technology in Design Process	EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						design education; studio practice; design process; technology; virtual reality	REALITY	Design discipline can be defined as it has dynamic, technologic, socio-cultural features and its process changes constantly. The design problems in the design studio are mostly fictional; the virtual user, program and space become concrete by the requirement program that is specified according to research in this process. Although this designed virtual space has potential for construction, it is observed that it remains at conceptual format on paper and doesn't become reality. It is a stubborn fact that both conceptual and construction project provide essential contributions to design discipline and make references to different aspects of design. The final design artifact generated in the light of this information, is beyond being just the perceptions, opinions and technological advancements. It can be defined as the reflection of the existence of its designer. In this report it will be emphasized how is design realized, how are the concern of conceptual thinking, analyzing, synthesizing, evaluating and resulting processes attained, where is the place of intelligence in the perception of problems. The importance of intelligence in the solving the problems and the experiences of memory in this process will be represented as well. As a result of this the design process and studio practice can be recognized as an "experimental" process and the developments in technology provide various interfaces and data. One of the purposes of this report is the discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of technology in the construction phase, which is the continuation of cognitive process. Beside this, design as an "interface" of susceptibility of its designer will be examined whether it reflects the original identities with technological advancements or not. Within the scope of this study, the real-physical environments perceived by an individual and the "perceptional phychology of space" created in individual's mind is compared to the individual's spatial perception experiencing in the virtual environments. The idea of the digital space created by using the VR and AR virtual reality technologies have been researched about to what extent it might be involved with the perception of real human psychology in design education. The effective use of technological visualizing methodologies such as VR and AR will expose a new perspective in design education.

J	Hof, AR; Bright, PW				Hof, Anouschka R.; Bright, Paul W.			Quantifying the long-term decline of the West European hedgehog in England by subsampling citizen-science datasets	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Citizen science; Datasets; Population trends; Subsampling; West European hedgehog	DETECTION PROBABILITY; BRITISH BUTTERFLIES; ERINACEUS-EUROPAEUS; ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH; ABUNDANCE; CONSERVATION; HISTORY; RANGE; BIRDS	It is increasingly important to be aware of trends in species abundances in order to be able to act ahead of possible irrecoverable declines and extinctions. Long-term monitoring of species is generally used to determine how a species is faring, which is essential knowledge for conservation planning and design. However, monitoring programmes that encompass large areas and long timespans are rare or non-existent for the vast majority of species. Citizen-science-based datasets provide a wealth of data on past and present species' occurrences but are often biased to a large extent. We evaluate the potential use of such datasets by subsampling datasets collected over different time periods to detect trends in the long-term temporal abundance of West European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), a species which is thought to be in decline in parts of its geographic range. We used subsampling as a means to account for quantitative differences between two non-systematic datasets of West European hedgehog occurrences in England; one dataset was collected by the public between 1960 and 1975 and one was collected between 2000 and 2015. Here, we confirm and quantify previous anecdotal evidence of a long-term decline of the species throughout England. We find that although the West European hedgehog is still widespread in England, a 5.0 to 7.4 % decline in occupied grid cells was observed when comparing the 2000-2015 dataset to the previous survey in 1960-1975 after adjusting for differences in effort. This suggests that the decline of the relative abundance of West European hedgehogs is moderate in England, 25 % being an amber alert for birds of conservation concern in the UK. Importantly, we show that subsampling disparate citizen-science datasets is a useful tool for monitoring species population trends.

This issue was investigated by examining the interaction between ecological interface design (EID) and individual differences in the context of a process control microworld. A number of potential predictors of performance were investigated, including: demographic data, type of interface, type of instruction, and data from two cognitive style tests. Eight linear regression analyses were conducted to determine which variables were the strongest predictors of performance. The results indicate that the strongest and most consistent predictor of performance was the interaction between a holist cognitive style score and an interface based on the principles of EID. That is, individuals who used an EID interface and who had high holist scores were the best performers. It seems that these individuals have the relational thinking ability that is required to exploit the value of the higher-order functional information provided by an EID interface. This empirical result has practical implications for operator selection. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) partnering framework for public construction projects	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Public procurement; Building Information Modeling (BIM); BIM adoption; BIM partnering		Organizational and people centered issues pose the greatest challenge for Building Information Modeling (BIM) implementation. Studies showed that BIM implementation is still a challenge for the North American construction industry. The Canadian construction industry, in contrast, is well behind that of the U.S. in its BIM adoption rate. Maturity and adoption of BIM depends mainly on the client or the owner in construction projects. Public sector clients often think that the market is not ready for BIM and are afraid to increase project costs by limiting competition. Moreover, if the contractor is not integrated in the project in the design phase, BIM has limited power. This paper proposes a 'BIM partnering' based public procurement framework to ensure 'best value' in construction projects. The case study presented in the paper proved the feasibility of proposed BIM based procurement in publicly-funded construction projects. The suggested contractual arrangement for the project resulted in improved productivity, better coordination, and reduced error, and rework. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The primary outcomes include knowledge and skills, and the secondary outcomes include critical thinking ability, mental health, blended learning design, and nursing students' attitudes toward blended learning.Background: Blended learning combines the advantages of online learning and traditional face-to-face learning, and makes up for the disadvantages of simple online learning or traditional learning. The effects of blended learning on the knowledge, skills, critical thinking ability, and mental health of nursing students were unknown. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.Methods: The present systematic review and meta-analysis was applied according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Publications were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, ERIC, CINAHL and the Cochrane's Library before February 2023. Two researchers independently retrieved articles and evaluated quality. The meta-analysis was performed using Stata 12.0 software according to PRISMA guidelines. The risk of bias in the selected studies was evaluated using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. Heterogeneity was assessed by I2 and P statistics. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as effective indicators.Results: A total of 26 studies involving 2823 nursing students were included in the present study. The results showed that blended learning courses were designed based on learning theory. Blended learning was more effective on the knowledge (SMD = 0.73, 95%CI [0.37, 1.09]) and skills (SMD = 0.86, 95% CI [0.35, 1.37]) compared with non-blended learning for nursing students. Critical thinking ability improved significantly through BL (SMD = 2.23, 95% CI [0.85, 3.61]). In addition, blended learning had a positive impact on nursing students' mental health. Nursing students were very satisfied with blended learning.Conclusions: The results of this study indicated that blended learning had a positive impact on nursing students. In the future, the optimal ratio of online to offline learning in blended learning should also be explored.

They most frequently read trade and local business publications; few regularly read or receive health and safety materials. They select business -related materials that are specific to their business, give them new ideas, or have information that is easy to use. Insurance companies and business associations are the most frequently mentioned sources of health and safety information. The most important aspects of a prototype newsletter are sponsorship, color and graphics, length and relevance. Most are positive about a university logo, because it indicates a trusted source. The front page should have a table of contents with short descriptions of articles and catchy headlines. A newsletter should take no more than ten minutes to read. Owners did not like articles that were written in first person, used quotes, were too personal or gave no solutions. Owners think a newsletter will be successful if it is targeted to their industry, shows costs, includes case studies about local businesses, isn't too academic, focuses on a different topic with each issue, and gives readers an opportunity to provide feedback.

J	Urgo, K; Arguello, J				Urgo, Kelsey; Arguello, Jaime			Understanding the "Pathway" Towards a Searcher's Learning Objective	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Search-as-learning; learning objectives; learning pathways	TASK COMPLEXITY; INFORMATION; DIFFICULTY; CONTEXT	Search systems are often used to support learning-oriented goals. This trend has given rise to the "search-as-learning" movement, which proposes that search systems should be designed to support learning. To this end, an important research question is: How does a searcher's type of learning objective (LO) influence their trajectory (or pathway) toward that objective? We report on a lab study (N = 36) in which participants gathered information to meet a specific type of LO. To characterize LOs and pathways, we leveraged Anderson and Krathwohl's (A&K's) taxonomy [3]. A&K's taxonomy situates LOs at the intersection of two orthogonal dimensions: (1) cognitive process (CP) (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and create) and (2) knowledge type (factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive knowledge). Participants completed learning-oriented search tasks that varied along three CPs (apply, evaluate, and create) and three knowledge types (factual, conceptual, and procedural knowledge). A pathway is defined as a sequence of learning instances (e.g., subgoals) that were also each classified into cells from A&K's taxonomy. Our study used a think-aloud protocol, and pathways were generated through a qualitative analysis of participants' think-aloud comments and recorded screen activities. We investigate three research questions. First, in RQ1, we study the impact of the LO on pathway characteristics (e.g., pathway length). Second, in RQ2, we study the impact of the LO on the types of A&K cells traversed along the pathway. Third, in RQ3, we study common and uncommon transitions between A&K cells along pathways conditioned on the knowledge type of the objective. We discuss implications of our results for designing search systems to support learning.

However, the purposeful use of cartoons is notably absent in many areas of health care as is evidence of their acceptability to patients and lay others. This paper outlines the process used to develop and evaluate cartoons and their acceptability for a series of self-management guidebooks for people with inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods: Principles for a process to develop information and cartoons were developed. Cartoon topics were created using qualitative research methods to obtain lay views and experiences. The CKD guidebook was used to provide a detailed exemplar of the process. Focus group and trial participants were recruited from primary care CKD registers. The book was part of a trial intervention; selected participants evaluated the cartoons during in-depth interviews which incorporated think-aloud methods. Results: In general, the cartoons developed by this process depict patient experiences, common situations, daily management dilemmas, making decisions and choices and the uncertainties associated with conditions. CKD cartoons were developed following two focus groups around the themes of getting a diagnosis; understanding the problem; feeling that facts were being withheld; and setting priorities. Think-aloud interviews with 27 trial participants found the CKD cartoons invoked amusement, recognition and reflection but were sometimes difficult to interpret. Conclusion: Humour is frequently utilised by people with long-term conditions to help adjustment and coping. Cartoons can help provide clarity and understanding and could address concerns related to health literacy. Using cartoons to engage and motivate people is a consideration untapped by conventional theories with the potential to improve information to support self-management.

Such decisions are carried out under high pressure, with a lack of information, and in limited time. This research applies Causal Artificial Intelligence to high-stakes decisions, aiming to encode causal assumptions based on human-like intelligence, and thereby produce interpretable and argumentative knowledge. We develop a Causal Bayesian Networks model based on causal science using d-separation and do-operations to discover the causal graph aligned with cognitive understanding. Causal odd ratios are used to measure the causal assumptions integrated with the real-world data to prove the proposed causal model compatibility. Causal effect relationships in the model are verified based on causal P-values and causal confident intervals and approved less than 1% by random chance. It shows that the causal model can encode cognitive understanding as precise, robust relationships. The concept of model design allows software agents to imitate human intelligence by inferring potential knowledge and be employed in high-stakes decision applications.

J	Han, YL; Cook, K; Mason, G; Shuman, TR				Han, Yen-Lin; Cook, Kathleen; Mason, Gregory; Shuman, Teodora Rutar			Enhance Engineering Design Education in the Middle Years With Authentic Engineering Problems	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN			English	Article							CURRICULUM; STUDENTS	Engineering design has been a requirement in the curriculum for engineering accreditation since the mid-90 s. This emphasis on engineering design has introduced significant changes to engineering curricula in freshmen and senior years with many engineering programs offering capstone (senior) and/or cornerstone (freshmen) design courses. Yet design-related content and experiences in the second and third years of the engineering curricula remain less common due to the heavy emphasis on fundamental engineering science courses in the middle years. This study investigated the possibility of developing design ability (thinking, process, and skills) in one of these courses. The method used was to incorporate real world, open-ended problem solving, specifically authentic engineering problem centered learning (AEPCL), into a junior-level heat transfer course. AEPCL uses authentic engineering problems (AEPs) as the backdrop to develop students' design abilities through solving open-ended, ill-structured problems. Results indicate that students who experienced AEPCL showed better design abilities than comparable students who did not experience AEPCL. Through AEPCL, students learn how to collect better information, make more reasonable assumptions, engage in better processes, and arrive at a more plausible, error-free, and high-quality solution in engineering design.

Are intermediate constraint question formats useful for evaluating student thinking and promoting learning in formative assessments?	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Authoring tools and methods; Improving classroom teaching; Interactive learning environments; Teaching/leaming strategies; Assessment techniques	MULTIPLE-CHOICE; NATURAL-SELECTION; CLOZE PROCEDURE; TOOL; MISCONCEPTIONS; KNOWLEDGE; DESIGN; ESSAY; FOCUS	There is a broad movement in science classes to emphasize higher-order thinking and complex skills over simple accumulation of facts. A major barrier to making this shift is a lack of good assessment tools for evaluating higher-order thinking that can be used with low effort by instructors. Computerized assessments aid instructors and increase efficiency, and potentially allow for immediate feedback. But easily-used question formats tend to be highly constrained (e.g. multiple-choice) and thus less informative on student thinking, while low constraint open-response formats (e.g. essay questions) are difficult to grade automatically. This is particularly problematic for formative assessments where immediate feedback specific to a student's current understanding is important to their learning. Here we explore two question formats that are intermediate in degree of constraint between open-response and multiple-choice formats. Intermediate constraint formats have the potential to allow some response construction while still enabling automatic feedback. We examine 15 questions in the two formats, with data from student interviews as well as from use in dozens of classrooms (both high school and university) as part of their regular curriculum. We find that the intermediate constraint questions enable automatic scoring of answers into specific categories of understanding and confusion, thus allowing for specific feedback to each student; that the intermediate constraint formats do encourage students to construct their own answers to a greater degree than multiple-choice; that they are usable by students; and that questions in those formats can show similar ranges of student answers as open-response. Further, using a split-class design in high school classrooms, we show that intermediate constraint questions can impact student learning to a greater degree than short answer questions. We conclude that these two question formats, and by extension perhaps other question formats with intermediate levels of constraint, are a useful addition to the toolbox of the educational software developer, but because they require a higher effort to construct than other formats, they should be reserved for key points in an online lesson.

J	Kim, SJ; Lee, JH				Kim, Sun-Joong; Lee, Ji-Hyun			A study on metadata structure and recommenders of biological systems to support bio-inspired design	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Bio-inspired design; Biological system metadata modeling; Knowledge-based system; Recommendation system; Ontology	ANALOGIES; GENERATION; SIMILARITY	Bio-inspired design was introduced as an alternative method to encourage breakthrough innovations during design projects by stimulating analogical reasoning and thinking of designers. However, the method did not perform as well as researchers expected because most designers, who are novices in the fields of biology and ecology, cannot infer the proper analogue (i.e. biological system) from nature. To resolve this fundamental problem, a causal model based representation framework for 'analogical reasoning' - searching and selecting the biological systems to apply - have been developed. In addition, ontology based repository structures and retrieval systems have been proposed to support 'analogical thinking' of designers. Nevertheless, these systematic approaches still restrict the candidates and inevitably lose potential biological systems relevant to the design project, due to the 'physical relation' biased problem and the ambiguity of the indexing mechanism of both current representation frameworks and retrieval systems. For example, the causality based support system known as a robust representation framework for a single biological system, stores information of a biological system only by its internal 'physical relations' and retrieves biological systetabms only by the physical relevance. However, from the perspective of ecological thinking, the further relatedness of physical, biological, and ecological relations' composes the holistic concept used to identify an organism in the flow of evolution because the 'biological and ecological relations' are also involved in the traits that designers may be interested in. Therefore, the supplementary information for 'biological and ecological relations' must be added to index the biological and environmental interactions, and to use the connectivity among entire organisms in the retrieval process. In this research, a causality based holistic representation framework for biological systems and an 'all-connected' ontology based repository and retrieval system are developed as a knowledge-based recommendation system to support bio-inspired design. The knowledge-based system we developed allows engineering designers to search and select a particular biological system and extract design strategy without much biological knowledge. This effort provides more opportunities in a bio-inspired design process by adding potential biological systems that might previously not have been considered.

J	Morgan, JP				Morgan, JP			Properties of superimposed BIBDs	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE			English	Article						balanced incomplete block design; bottom-stratum orthogonality; recovery of interblock information; optimal design	DESIGNS	Superimposed designs in the sense to be considered in this paper arise in the following manner. First, a balanced incomplete block design is implemented to compare a set of treatments T-1. At some later time, it is desired to compare a second set of treatments T-2 using the same experimental units. If the effects of the treatments T-1 are thought to still be present, either in a direct fashion as part of an on-going experiment, or as residual effects of a prior experiment, then they effectively become another blocking factor to be accounted for in the estimation of contrasts for T-2. What then is the optimal assignment for the set T-2 to the units? Among the results proven here are (i) a BIBD for T-2 that achieves bottom-stratum orthogonality with respect to T-1 is optimal for the usual analysis, and (ii) most of the known BIBDs that achieve this orthogonality are also optimal for the analysis with recovery of interblock information, even if not achieving block-stratum orthogonality, provided the number of replicates is not too large.

Solving the puzzle: The effects of contextual information and feedback on the interpretation of a crime scene	JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE PSYCHOLOGY AND OFFENDER PROFILING			English	Article						contextual information; crime scene investigation; decision-making; feedback; reasoning	DECISION-MAKING; OBJECTS; MEMORY; PERCEPTION; SEARCH; FRUGAL; MODELS; EXPERT; WANT	In this study, we examined how the provision of contextual information and the ability to ask questions and obtain feedback affected mock investigators' interpretation of a crime scene. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions in a 2x2 design and assessed two photographs of the same crime scene. Participants were instructed to write a narrative about what they thought had happened at the scene. Results showed that the provision of contextual information and the ability to ask questions had no effect on the lengths of the narratives participants produced. However, participants who received contextual information wrote a more factual narrative containing more descriptions of actions before, during, and after the crime. Across all conditions, most of the questions were asked about persons who could in some way be involved in the crime. Results of this study indicate that the provision of contextual information helped participants to focus on the more factual, rather than speculative elements, of the crime.	[van den Eeden, Claire A.

To support the development of individual competency in visualization processing, it is important to ascertain if we can track users' progress or difficulties they might have while working with a given visualization. In this paper, we extend previous work on predicting in real time a user's learning curve-a mathematical model that can represent a user's skill acquisition ability-when working with a visualization. First, we investigate whether results we previously obtained in predicting users' learning curves during visualization processing generalize to a different visualization. Second, we study to what extent we can make predictions on a user's learning curve without information on the visualization being used. Our models leverage various data sources, including a user's gaze behavior, pupil dilation, and cognitive abilities. We show that these models outperform a baseline that leverages knowledge on user task performance so far. Our best performing model achieves good accuracies in predicting users' learning curves even after observing users' performance on a few tasks only. These results represent an important step toward understanding how to support users in learning a new visualization.

Instead, new education methods are used for innovative application. Therefore, the task-driven classroom teaching method is integrated into information technology teaching of junior middle school by designing specific cases. From the theoretical knowledge teaching and the comprehensive operational practice teaching, we explore the effect of using the task-driven classroom learning method on students' learning attitudes and learning effectiveness in an information technology course. The experimental results show that using the task-driven classroom teaching method has significant positive correlation on student learning performance, learning interest, and creative thinking. This idea can stimulate interest in learning and improve the comprehensive quality of students; thus, it can promote the reform of information technology education and curriculums. For a more detailed discussion, the results will be discussed in this paper.

J	Pouamoun, AN; Kocabas, I				Pouamoun, Abdel Naser; Kocabas, Ilker			Multi-agent-based hybrid peer-to-peer system for distributed information retrieval	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Broker-based peer-2-peer network; distributed information retrieval; multi-agent systems; score normalisation		With the increasingly huge amount of data located in various databases and the need for users to access them, distributed information retrieval (DIR) has been at the core of the preoccupations of a number of researchers. Indeed, numerous DIR systems and architectures have been proposed including the broker-based architecture. Moreover, providing DIR with more flexibility and adaptability has led researchers thinking to build DIR with software agents. Thus, this research proposes a design and an implementation of a novel system based on the broker-based architecture and the peer-to-peer (P2P) network called broker-based P2P network. The proposed architecture is implemented with a multi-agent system (MAS) where the main agent playing the role of the broker, receives query from a peer agent and forwards them to other peer agents each with their index and resources. Upon completing retrieval process at each peer agent, results are directly sent to the peer agent that initiated the query without using the broker agent. Java Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE) is used to implement the agents and, for experiments, TERRIER (TERabyte RetRIEveR) is extended and used as the search engine to retrieve the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) collections dataset notably TREC-6. The peer agent that originated the query progressively collects results coming from other peer agents, normalises and merges them and then proceeds with re-ranking. For normalisation, MinMax and Sum that are unsupervised normalisation methods are used.

Data-Based Considerations for Electronic Family Health History Applications	CIN-COMPUTERS INFORMATICS NURSING			English	Article						Family health history; Genomics; Nursing informatics	QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTION; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK; PUBLIC-HEALTH; PRIMARY-CARE; TOOL; ACCURACY; CANCER; INFORMATION; MEDICINE; GENOMICS	Family health history contains important information about the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to patterns of health and illness in families. Applications for collecting, managing, and analyzing family health history could be improved if their design were informed by an understanding of how consumers think about and report family health history. This article presents a descriptive analysis of themes from family health history interviews that have implications for development, selection, and use of family health history tools. Important themes included ways in which family is defined, including nonbiological family members and pets; ideas about health and disease, including degree of exposure and individual perceptions; and barriers to reporting family health history, including large biological families and uncertainty. Some themes identified (eg, uncertainty) have been recognized previously and continue to be important considerations. Other themes identified, such as perceptions about severity of illness or conditions and causal relationships, are newly recognized and may have implications for nurses and other providers designing, selecting, and using family health history applications.

OBJECTIVES: to describe women's perceptions, preconceptions, and information preferences regarding the breast cancer screening (BCS) programme paper and web information materials of the Agency for Health Protection of the Metropolitan Area of Milan (Lombardy Region, Northern Italy). DESIGN: qualitative, descriptive study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: participants' voluntary recruitment took place in the registration departments of three hospitals. Participants were purposively recruited based on sociodemographic characteristics of the target population of the programme (44 women aged 40-74 years, living in the Metropolitan Area of Milan). In each material type subgroup, different health literacy levels and age classes were included, until thematic saturation was reached. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: thematic analysis of qualitative data collected during think-aloud interviews. RESULTS: the thematic analysis identified 5 main themes: 1. validation of the information reported in the materials, according to the interviewees' personal experiences; 2. information preferences of particular subgroups of women, which led to a tailored approach for the web materials; 3. negativeemotions elicited while receiving information regarding BCS limits, which guided therewriting ofcertain definitions; 4. disproportioned risk perception, with greater weight attributed to the risk of false negative results than the risk of overdiagnosis; 5. organizational preferences regarding the type and frequency of the provided tests and the age limits of the programme. CONCLUSIONS: in the present sample of women living in the Metropolitan Area of Milan, knowledge and comprehension of overdiagnosis are scarce. The main reasons for distrust in the BCS programme rely on the preexisting beliefs regarding the most appropriate tests and age limits. These beliefs were established from previously received information, inconsistent with that officially provided by the programme.

Regrettably, laypeople often lack the required skills and intrinsic motivation to do so. In a 1 x 2 between-subjects design (training vs. no training), the present study investigated if training the members of a dyad on critical questioning individually promotes their critical questioning behavior in discourse and their subsequent argumentation behavior. Results of content analyses show corresponding beneficial effects of the training. Furthermore, analyses revealed a marginal positive effect of the training on general critical thinking scores. The training also succeeded in ensuring students' intrinsic motivation. Implications for developing further trainings to promote critical argumentation and critical thinking are discussed.

Scenario-Based Evaluation of Team Health Information Technology to Support Pediatric Trauma Care Transitions	APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						team health information technology; team cognition; scenario-based evaluation; pediatric trauma; care transitions	EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; PERCEPTIONS; AWARENESS; FAILURES; SYSTEM	Background Clinicians need health information technology (IT) that better supports their work. Currently, most health IT is designed to support individuals; however, more and more often, clinicians work in cross-functional teams. Trauma is one of the leading preventable causes of children's death. Trauma care by its very nature is team based but due to the emergent nature of trauma, critical clinical information is often missed in the transition of these patients from one service or unit to another. Teamwork transition technology can help support these transitions and minimize information loss while enhancing information gathering and storage. In this study, we created a large screen technology to support shared situational awareness across multiple clinical roles and departments. Objectives This study aimed to examine if the Teamwork Transition Technology (T (3) ) supports teams and team cognition. Methods We used a scenario-based mock-up methodology with 36 clinicians and staff from the different units and departments who are involved in pediatric trauma to examine T (3) . Results Results of the evaluation show that most participants agreed that the technology helps achieve the goals set out in the design phase. Respondents thought that T (3) organizes and presents information in a different way that was helpful to them. Conclusion In this study, we examined a health IT (T (3) ) that was designed to support teams and team cognition. The results of our evaluation show that participants agreed that T (3) does support them in their work and increases their situation awareness.	[Hoonakker, Peter L.

J	Liu, K				Liu, Kai			Analysis of the Conflict between Car Commuter's Route Choice Habitual Behavior and Traffic Information Search Behavior	SENSORS			English	Article						route choice; habitual behavior; habit strength; traffic information; experiment	RATIONAL USER EQUILIBRIUM; DECISION-MAKING; BOUNDED RATIONALITY; TRAVEL BEHAVIOR; CONTEXT CHANGE; MODE CHOICE; FIELD; DISCONTINUITY; ASSIGNMENT; PROVISION	Motivated by the conflict between travelers' habitual choice behavior and traffic information search behavior, in this paper, a behavioral experiment under different types of traffic information (i.e., per-trip traffic information and en-route traffic information) was designed to obtain data regarding car commuters' daily route choices. Based on the observed data, participants' route choices, habit strength, response time, and information search behaviors were analyzed. It is concluded that, in the beginning, the traffic information had a great influence on the habit participants' route choices, let them think more, and made most of them switch from habit route to the best route (as recommended by traffic information); however, as time went on, the impact of traffic information declined, and several features of habits, such as automatically responding and repeated behavior, would reappear in some participants' decision-making. Meanwhile, the different way of traffic information search behaviors (i.e., in active performance or in passive reception) could cause different information compliance ratios. These results would help to understand the interrelationship between car commuters' daily route choice behaviors and traffic information search behaviors in short-term and in long-term, respectively, and provide an interesting starting point for the development of practical traffic information issuing strategies to enhance the impact of traffic information to alleviate traffic congestion during morning commuting.

This pilot study used functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), while capturing conscious cognition using Think Aloud (TA) during an incremental paced cycling exercise. Methods: A mixed design was implemented with cycling expertise (untrained vs. trained) as the between groups variable and incremental self-paced stage (5 stages of increasing effort) and site (12 optodes across the PFC) as the within groups variables. Dependent measures were the changes in cortical O(2)Hb, and physiological indicators (% heart rate max (%HRmax), average power output (APO), peak power output (PPO), rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and blood lactate (Bla)) over time. Participants used TA throughout their second interval trial. Results: Trained cyclists had higher APO and maximum power output (MPO) from stages 2-5, in addition to a greater increase in PPO over the whole trial. There were significant main effects of stage on %HRmax, Bla and RPE. Differences in cortical haemodynamics were found specifically in areas in the mid left and right PFC. TA data demonstrated that untrained participants verbalised more irrelevant information and feelings of pain and fatigue, in addition to both groups verbalising significantly more motivation-related thoughts during the final stage. Conclusion: This pilot is the first to capture changes in Cox, physiological measures and conscious cognition through the use of TA. We demonstrate the potential role of mid- PFC, and how conscious cognition may change over time. This study has implications for coaches and sport psychologists who may want to understand the cognitions of their athlete during an event and support low level athletes in developing a better understanding of the own cognitions.

J	Makri, S; Buckley, L				Makri, Stephann; Buckley, Lily			Down the rabbit hole: Investigating disruption of the information encountering process	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SERENDIPITY; SEEKING; MODEL; ENGAGEMENT	Information encountering (IE) often occurs during active information seeking and involves passively finding unsought, unexpected information that is subjectively considered interesting, useful, or potentially useful. While the idealized IE process involves engaging with information after noticing it (for example, by examining it, conducting follow-up seeking to determine usefulness, then using or sharing it), the process can be disrupted-resulting in missed opportunities for knowledge and insight creation. This study provides a detailed understanding of when and why the process can be disrupted. Think-aloud observations and Critical Incident Interviews were conducted with 15 web users, focusing on examining when they encountered information but did not engage with it. Factors that discouraged engagement and simultaneously encouraged participants to return to active, goal-directed information seeking by disrupting the IE process were identified. These factors individually and collectively demonstrate that IE can instigate a highly uncertain cost-benefit trade-off, sometimes resulting in encounterers being cautious by returning to "less risky" active seeking. Design suggestions are made for reducing the uncertainty of deciding whether to engage with encountered information and making it easier to return to the active seeking task if disruption occurs.

We present an exploratory study of children solving a spatial puzzle task. We investigate how the affordances of physical, graphical and tangible interfaces may facilitate the development of thinking skills including mental visualisation, problem space exploration and collaboration. We utilise the theory of complementary actions taken from embodied cognition to develop a video coding methodology that allows us to classify behavioural activity and make inferences about thinking skills development. Our findings indicated that the combination of direct hands-on input style with audio-visual feedback facilitated by the tangible user interface enabled a dynamic task completion strategy, which supports the development of mental skills with a slight time cost. The mouse and graphical user interface supported a trial and error approach, which may limit skills development. The physical cardboard puzzle enabled effective task completion but provided less support for social interaction and problem space exploration. We conclude with design recommendations.

Conceptual developments in our understanding of knowledge are merging with machine-learning methods for making sense of data. This creates new, and interesting ways in which we can document and analyse knowledge, and conceptual change. Problem . Currently, the study of conceptual change is often limited to small sample sizes because of the laborious nature of existing, purely qualitative approaches. Method . We present Association Rule Mining to better measure and understand changes in students' thinking at the classroom level, based on data collected while implementing a constructionist learning activity in a US college classroom. Association Rule Mining is used on a set of qualitatively coded student responses. We then look at changes in the association rules between students' responses before and after a learning activity to better understand students'conceptual change at the classroom level. Results . We find that students converge on a more complete and accurate set of causal claims in their post-responses. Finding these changes would have been difficult or impossible without Association Rule Mining, or a similar approach. This suggests that Association Rule Mining is a potentially fruitful approach to analysing conceptual change at the classroom level. Constructivist content .

Young Children Can Learn Scientific Reasoning with Teachable Agents	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Computer-assisted instruction; teachable agents; instructional design; science curriculum; science education	CLASS-INCLUSION; PARADIGM	A teachable agent (TA) is an instructional technology that capitalizes on the organizing metaphor of teaching another, in this case, a computer agent. As one instance, students teach their agents by creating concept maps that connect nodes with relational links. TAs use simple artificial intelligence to draw conclusions based on what they have been taught and to trace the path of their reasoning visually. TAs literally make thinking visible, with the goal of helping children learn to reason. TAs also provide interactive feedback and engender in students a sense of responsibility toward improving their agents' knowledge. We describe, in detail, a TA designed to teach hierarchical reasoning in science, and then present a 2-year research study using this TA with 153 fourth-grade children learning about organisms, taxonomies, and ecosystems. We show that the TA improved learning from the standard curriculum as measured by the curriculum's accompanying tests. The TA also helped children learn hierarchical reasoning, as measured by researcher-designed tests. The research indicates that, contrary to some theoretical positions, it is possible to help younger children learn scientific modes of reasoning, specifically by means of TA software.

The development and clinical evaluation of a "traffic-light' design dermatology outpatient discharge information checklist	BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY			English	Article							DECISION-MAKING; FOLLOW-UP; CONSENSUS; GUIDELINES; CRITERIA; DELPHI; READINESS	BackgroundAlthough multiple factors influence discharge decisions, there is no structured guidance to assist clinicians in making informed decisions. A discharge information checklist might improve the appropriateness of dermatology clinicians' discharge decisions. ObjectivesTo generate consensus among dermatologists on the content of an outpatient discharge checklist, to create one and to seek clinicians' opinions on its usefulness. MethodsSeventeen consultant dermatologists from five National Health Service trusts completed a 72-item Delphi questionnaire. A five-point Likert scale was used to rate each item for importance in contributing to a high-quality discharge decision. Eighteen clinicians completed a questionnaire evaluating checklist use. ResultsConsensus was determined when 75% of consultants rated an item very important' or important'. There was strong inter-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=0958) and fair inter-rater agreement (Fleiss kappa=0269). There were 26 consensus-agreed items, condensed to 13 that formed the traffic-light' checklist. These are disease-related issues (diagnostic certainty, disease severity, treatment appropriateness, patient manageable in primary care, patient's benefit from follow-up), patient empowerment issues (understanding diagnosis and treatment outcome, having a clear plan, treatment side-effects, ability to self-manage) and addressing concerns (patient concerns, easy reaccess to secondary care, whether patient and clinician are happy with the decision). Twelve clinicians (67%) found the checklist useful, 11 (61%) wanted to use it in future, 10 (56%) thought it was useful for training and three (17%) said it helped their thinking. Clinicians suggested its use for auditing and for training clinicians and administrators. ConclusionsItems were identified to create an outpatient discharge information checklist, which demonstrated high acceptability.	[Harun, N. A.; Finlay, A.

In particular, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) possess a high theoretical capacity (820 mAh g(-1) and 5855 mAh cm(-3)) and low anode potential (-0.76 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode), owing to the bivalent ion migration and the high stability of zinc metal in water, resulting in a relatively satisfactory energy density for practical applications. However, AZIBs still face some challenges, such as zinc dendrite growth, narrow voltage window, active materials dissolution, poor zinc ion insertion/extraction kinetics, and so forth, largely impeding the continued progress of AZIBs. Nanostructure design strategies provide a powerful and broad research thought to effectively solve the above problems, owing to unique properties at the nanoscale. Herein, we demonstrate an overview of recent progress in AZIBs from the perspective of nanostructure design, and focus on the nanostructure engineering of cathode materials, zinc anodes and flexible gel electrolytes, giving rise to an excellent electrochemical performances of AZIBs. Finally, a brief summary for nanostructure design strategies applied in AZIBs is presented, and next research directions are proposed to inspire suggestive instructions for further research into AZIBs.

Although a large number of studies have been made on the human performance, little is known about the similarity effect in human performance. The purpose of this paper is to propose and validate the quantitative and predictive model on the human response time in the user interface with the concept of similarity. However, it is not easy to explain the human performance with only similarity or information amount. We are confronted by two difficulties: making the quantitative model on the human response time with the similarity and validating the proposed model by experimental work. We made the quantitative model based on the Hick's law and the law of practice. In addition, we validated the model with various experimental conditions by measuring participants' response time in the environment of computer-based display. Experimental results reveal that the human performance is improved by the user interface's similarity. We think that the proposed model is useful for the user interface design and evaluation phases.

With designers using probabilistic reliability assessment concepts, Monte Carlo techniques and databases as tools, a reconstruction of the present standards can be expected. This paper addresses one possible alternative for qualitative changes in design standards and corresponding reengineering of the entire reliability assessment procedure. This includes introducing a probability of failure as a measure of structural reliability, developing a new generation of "hybrid" standards (basic and secondary standards, databases and software mutually interconnected using information nets), expressing variable input data as histograms and using simulation techniques to analyze the complex probabilistic interrelationships between load effects, material properties, and other quantities affecting reliability. The significance of the transition from a deterministic to probabilistic "way of thinking" is emphasized in terms of both education and design practice. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Educational Technologies in Problem-Based Learning in Health Sciences Education: A Systematic Review	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Review						systematic review; educational technologies; problem-based learning; medical education; health sciences; software; digital learning object; interactive whiteboard; learning management system	MEDICAL-EDUCATION; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; VIRTUAL PATIENTS; STUDENTS LEARN; ONLINE; ENVIRONMENT; INQUIRY; EXPERIENCES; CURRICULUM; KNOWLEDGE	Background: As a modern pedagogical philosophy, problem-based learning (PBL) is increasingly being recognized as a major research area in student learning and pedagogical innovation in health sciences education. A new area of research interest has been the role of emerging educational technologies in PBL. Although this field is growing, no systematic reviews of studies of the usage and effects of educational technologies in PBL in health sciences education have been conducted to date. Objective: The aim of this paper is to review new and emerging educational technologies in problem-based curricula, with a specific focus on 3 cognate clinical disciplines: medicine, dentistry, and speech and hearing sciences. Analysis of the studies reviewed focused on the effects of educational technologies in PBL contexts while addressing the particular issue of scaffolding of student learning. Methods: A comprehensive computerized database search of full-text articles published in English from 1996 to 2014 was carried out using 3 databases: ProQuest, Scopus, and EBSCOhost. Eligibility criteria for selection of studies for review were also determined in light of the population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) guidelines. The population was limited to postsecondary education, specifically in dentistry, medicine, and speech and hearing sciences, in which PBL was the key educational pedagogy and curriculum design. Three types of educational technologies were identified as interventions used to support student inquiry: learning software and digital learning objects; interactive whiteboards (IWBs) and plasma screens; and learning management systems (LMSs). Results: Of 470 studies, 28 were selected for analysis. Most studies examined the effects of learning software and digital learning objects (n = 20) with integration of IWB (n = 5) and LMS (n = 3) for PBL receiving relatively less attention. The educational technologies examined in these studies were seen as potentially fit for problem-based health sciences education. Positive outcomes for student learning included providing rich, authentic problems and/ or case contexts for learning; supporting student development of medical expertise through the accessing and structuring of expert knowledge and skills; making disciplinary thinking and strategies explicit; providing a platform to elicit articulation, collaboration, and reflection; and reducing perceived cognitive load. Limitations included cumbersome scenarios, infrastructure requirements, and the need for staff and student support in light of the technological demands of new affordances. Conclusions: This literature review demonstrates the generally positive effect of educational technologies in PBL. Further research into the various applications of educational technology in PBL curricula is needed to fully realize its potential to enhance problem-based approaches in health sciences education.

Thinking styles and doctors' knowledge and behaviours relating to acute coronary syndromes guidelines	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article							INFORMATION-PROCESSING STYLES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ATTITUDE-CHANGE; CARE; PERSONALITY; MESSAGES; COMMUNICATION; PERSPECTIVE; PREDICTORS; PREVENTION	Background: How humans think and make decisions is important in understanding behaviour. Hence an understanding of cognitive processes among physicians may inform our understanding of behaviour in relation to evidence implementation strategies. A personality theory, Cognitive-Experiential Self Theory (CEST) proposes a relationship between different ways of thinking and behaviour, and articulates pathways for behaviour change. However prior to the empirical testing of interventions based on CEST, it is first necessary to demonstrate its suitability among a sample of healthcare workers. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between thinking styles and the knowledge and clinical practices of doctors directly involved in the management of acute coronary syndromes. Methods: Self-reported doctors' thinking styles (N = 74) were correlated with results from a survey investigating knowledge, attitudes, and clinical practice, and evaluated against recently published acute coronary syndrome clinical guidelines. Results: Guideline-discordant practice was associated with an experiential style of thinking. Conversely, guideline-concordant practice was associated with a higher preference for a rational style of reasoning. Conclusion: Findings support that while guidelines might be necessary to communicate evidence, other strategies may be necessary to target discordant behaviours. Further research designed to examine the relationships found in the current study is required.

J	Lu, LD; Xu, J; Lu, ZG; Wei, JC				Lu, Liangdong; Xu, Jia; Lu, Zhenggang; Wei, Jiuchang			Estimating the crisis information coverage model in the internet communities	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Internet; Diffusion; Crisis; Obsolescence; Coverage	SYSTEM THINKING SKILLS; GROWTH-MODELS; MANAGEMENT; EDUCATION; NEWS	Purpose In this study, the process of crisis information communication is viewed as a systems-based concept. An integrated and systematic three-phase model has been constructed to describe the process of crisis information coverage on the internet. By analyzing factors in the three stages that affect the coverage ratio and speed, this study aims to explore the law of information communication in this process and provide useful evidence for crisis managers to make informed decisions. Design/methodology/approach A complete information communication model has been constructed including the following three stages: crisis information release, crisis information diffusion and crisis information reception. The effects of important factors and variables in the model have been studied, including the crisis information release quantity, crisis information release mode, crisis information diffusion speed and crisis information obsolescence speed. Findings The quantitative analysis shows that crisis information release quantity and diffusion speed are positively correlated with coverage ratio; crisis information obsolescence speed is negatively correlated with coverage ratio; and crisis information release mode affects the speed of coverage but does not affect the final coverage ratio.

Yet, all too often, technology policy is written with primarily mainstream populations in mind. In this article, drawing on Value Sensitive Design and discount evaluation methods, we introduce a new methodDiverse Voicesfor strengthening pre-publication technology policy documents from the perspective of underrepresented groups. Cost effective and high impact, the Diverse Voices method intervenes by soliciting input from experiential expert panels (i.e., members of a particular stakeholder group and/or those serving that group). We first describe the method. Then we report on two case studies demonstrating its use: one with a white paper on augmented reality technology with expert panels on people with disabilities, people who were formerly or currently incarcerated, and women; and the other with a strategy document on automated driving vehicle technologies with expert panels on youth, non-car drivers, and extremely low-income people. In both case studies, panels identified significant shortcomings in the pre-publication documents which, if addressed, would mitigate some of the disparate impact of the proposed policy recommendations on these particular stakeholder groups. Our discussion includes reflection on the method, evidence for its success, its limitations, and future directions.

They are becoming much more involved in business-related issues. When defining computing curriculums, this trend needs to be taken into consideration, for example, by proposing courses on business and IT integration. This paper presents a transdisciplinary, problem-based learning course that addresses business and IT. The target audience is computer science and software engineering students. The course has three modules: a competitive game to illustrate business thinking, role-playing to practice IT requirement analysis, and an IT integration project to present how modern off-the-shelf technologies contribute to IT system realization. Each module has several sections comprising experiential learning and traditional ex cathedra lectures. The originality of the course lies in the combination of breadth of the subject and depth on what is taught. The goals of the course and its detailed contents are presented: the emphasis is on the process-related/technical and emotional learning experience by the students and on the author's experiences gained from teaching that course.

Emotional design in products plays a key role in enhancing user experience and inducing user emotional resonance. In recent years, based on the user's emotional experience, the design concept of strengthening product emotional design has become a new direction for most designers to improve their design thinking. In the emotional interaction design, the machine needs to capture the user's key information in real time, recognize the user's emotional state, and use a variety of clues to finally determine the appropriate user model. Based on this background, this research uses a deep learning mechanism for more accurate and effective emotion recognition, thereby optimizing the design of the interactive system and improving the user experience. First of all, this research discusses how to use user characteristics such as speech, facial expression, video, heartbeat, etc., to make machines more accurately recognize human emotions. Through the analysis of various characteristics, the speech is selected as the experimental material. Second, a speech-based emotion recognition method is proposed. The mel-Frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) of the speech signal is used as the input of the improved long and short-term memory network (ILSTM). To ensure the integrity of the information and the accuracy of the output at the next moment, ILSTM makes peephole connections in the forget gate and input gate of LSTM, and adds the unit state as input data to the threshold layer. The emotional features obtained by ILSTM are input into the attention layer, and the self-attention mechanism is used to calculate the weight of each frame of speech signal. The speech features with higher weights are used to distinguish different emotions and complete the emotion recognition of the speech signal. Experiments on the EMO-DB and CASIA datasets verify the effectiveness of the model for emotion recognition. Finally, the feasibility of emotional interaction system design is discussed.

A univocally recognized definition and a dedicated regulation for this emerging food category is lacking, and a gap exists between the technological and the nutritional viewpoints. Involved actors speak different languages, thus impinging the progression towards an integrated approach for functional food development. A holistic approach to rationalize functional food development was here proposed, i.e., the "Functional Food Development Cycle". First regulation and definitions were reviewed. The technological approaches for functional food design were then described, followed by the efficacy evaluation ones. Merging the technological and the evaluation viewpoints, by identifying the best compromise between quality and functionality, is pivotal to develop effective functional foods. Finally, delivering functional food on the market requires dedicated communication strategies. These in turn can provide information about consumer needs, thus representing an input for regulatory bodies to drive the development of functional food, feeding it within an iterative and virtuous holistic cycle.

However, there is a growing interest to widen the sustainability concept to include the social and ethical information of the fishery and aquaculture industry and to go further from the voluntary approach on the labeling of these aspects in FAPs. For this reason, using data from 2021 Eurobarometer and using machine learning techniques, we disentangle the characteristics of the FAP buyers that consider the importance of environmental impact, ethical, and social information appearing on FAP labeling. The results confirmed that most of the consumers who consider environmental, social, and ethical aspects when buying FAPs also think that this information should be labeled. In line with other works, young, educated, and environmentally aware consumers in high-income countries are more likely to request this information in the FAP label. One interesting finding of the study relates with the asymmetric impact of the variables and the important group of respondents who do not consider these aspects but also advocate to include them in the FAP label. The study outcomes can be beneficial for policymakers to design future public policies regarding FAP labeling, as well as to be taken into consideration in the marketing policies of fishery and aquaculture producers and retailers.

Using Co-design in Mobile Health System Development: A Qualitative Study With Experts in Co-design and Mobile Health System Development	JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH			English	Article						co-design; mHealth; guidelines; qualitative study; mobile phone	MHEALTH; THINKING; CARE	Background: The proliferation of mobile devices has enabled new ways of delivering health services through mobile health systems. Researchers and practitioners emphasize that the design of such systems is a complex endeavor with various pitfalls, including limited stakeholder involvement in design processes and the lack of integration into existing system landscapes. Co-design is an approach used to address these pitfalls. By recognizing users as experts of their own experience, co-design directly involves users in the design process and provides them an active role in knowledge development, idea generation, and concept development. Objective: Despite the existence of a rich body of literature on co-design methodologies, limited research exists to guide the co-design of mobile health (mHealth) systems. This study aims to contextualize an existing co-design framework for mHealth applications and construct guidelines to address common challenges of co-designing mHealth systems. Methods: Tapping into the knowledge and experience of experts in co-design and mHealth systems development, we conducted an exploratory qualitative study consisting of 16 semistructured interviews. Thereby, a constructivist ontological position was adopted while acknowledging the socially constructed nature of reality in mHealth system development. Purposive sampling across web-based platforms (eg, Google Scholar and ResearchGate) and publications by authors with co-design experience in mHealth were used to recruit co-design method experts (n=8) and mHealth system developers (n=8). Data were analyzed using thematic analysis along with our objectives of contextualizing the co-design framework and constructing guidelines for applying co-design to mHealth systems development. Results: The contextualized framework captures important considerations of the mHealth context, including dedicated prototyping and implementation phases, and an emphasis on immersion in real-world contexts. In addition, 7 guidelines were constructed that directly pertain to mHealth: understanding stakeholder vulnerabilities and diversity, health behavior change, co-design facilitators, immersion in the mHealth ecosystem, postdesign advocates, health-specific evaluation criteria, and usage data and contextual research to understand impact. Conclusions: System designers encounter unique challenges when engaging in mHealth systems development. The contextualized co-design framework and constructed guidelines have the potential to serve as a shared frame of reference to guide the co-design of mHealth systems and facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration at the nexus of information technology and health research.

J	Li, SX; Liu, L; Peng, CH				Li, Shaoxiong; Liu, Le; Peng, Changhai			Energy strategy pattern for climate responsive architecture: workflow in the early stages of design	ARCHITECTURAL SCIENCE REVIEW			English	Article						Energy strategy pattern; system boundary; synergy mechanism; climate responsive design; workflow	PERSPECTIVE; BUILDINGS; FIELD	Climate responsive design has been a topic of widespread concern and discussion over the past period of time. This paper integrates the thinking heuristic method based on energy strategy pattern with visualization digital technology in a new design framework. Describes an early stage workflow with energy-saving design and real-time analysis simulation. This method divides the real world into several nested energy levels and identifies the energy subsystems in the region. The matter information in the design boundary is translated into the corresponding energy boundary by descriptive language. A series of optimization objectives and multiple constraints are coupled in each energy strategy model. The heuristic rules implied in the pattern guide the designer to complete the decision-making process with the help of modelling, simulation and optimization tools. An office building in hot summer and warm winter area is used as an empirical case. Studies have shown that strategy patterns are more directional in multi-level energy responsive design than traditional design flows. A comprehensive design approach that combines analysis and quantitative metrics assessments not only provides the design team with more solutions, but also ensures consistency between the conceptual and performance objectives.

Most research examines creation/evolution among liberal arts majors, general public adults, or, infrequently, middle or high school science teachers. Thus, research truncates the range of ersatz science thinking and the samples it studies. We examined diverse beliefs, e.g., extraterrestrials, magic, Biblical creation, and evolution, among 540 female and 123 male future teachers, including 325 elementary education majors. We study how these cognitions related to education major and, because popular media often present pseudoscience "information", student media use. Future elementary educators most often rejected evolution and endorsed "creationism" or Intelligent Design. Education majors held similar beliefs about astrology, UFO landings, or magic. Compared with other education students, elementary education majors watched less news or science television and read fewer popular science magazines. However, religious and media variables explained more variation in creation/evolution beliefs than education major. We discuss implications of our findings for elementary school science education and how teacher educators may be able to affect pseudoscience beliefs among their elementary education students.

Design Space Characterization for Meeting Cost and Carbon Reduction Goals Smart Irrigation Controllers in the Southwestern United States	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						carbon dioxide (CO2); design for environment; industrial ecology; information and communication technology; life cycle thinking; water consumption		P>Smart irrigation controllers (SICs) can save water by adapting watering schedules to climate and soil conditions. The potential benefit of SICs is particularly high in southwestern U.S. states, where the arid climate makes water scarcer and increases watering needs of landscapes. A number of studies have tested the ability of SICs to save water in residential and small commercial settings. Results generally show overall savings, but there is substantial variability, including cases of increased water use. Though there are many controllers on the market, we argue there is a further need for optimization of design and field performance. To inform the technology development process, we develop a design for environment method, which overlays economic and environmental performance parameters under different operating conditions. This method is applied to characterize design goals for controller price and water savings that SICs must meet to yield life cycle carbon dioxide reductions and economic savings in southwestern U.S. states, accounting for regional variability in electricity and water prices and carbon overhead. Results from applying the model to SICs in the Southwest suggest that some areas are significantly easier to design for. One concept to realize improved design in practice is to build out the controller market in a staged set of niches, starting from a more favorable area then moving toward more challenging conditions.

Conceptual model of a future farm management information system	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						System boundary; Future farm; ICT; Information systems	DECISION-MAKING; CROP MANAGEMENT; METHODOLOGY; ADOPTION; PERSPECTIVES; AGRICULTURE; SIMULATION; THINKING; SUPPORT; CIM	Future and even current European farmers are experiencing that the managerial tasks for arable farming are shifting to a new paradigm, requiring increased attention to economic viability and the interaction with the surroundings. To this end, an integration of information systems is needed to advise managers of formal instructions, recommended guidelines and documentation requirements for various decision making processes. In the EU funded project FutureFarm, a new model and prototype of a new Farm Information Management System (FMIS) which meets these changing requirements will be developed. The aim of the work presented in this paper is to define and analyse the system boundaries and relevant decision processes for such a novel FMIS as a prerequisite for a dedicated information modelling. The boundaries and scope of the system are described in terms of actors and functionalities, where actors are entities interfacing with the system (e.g. managers, software, databases). In order to analyse the complex and soft systems situations of how to develop an effective FMIS, which effectively meets farmers' changing needs a conceptual model was developed based on soft systems methodology (SSM) and based on information derived from four pilot farms representing diverse conditions across the EU that are partners of the FutureFarm project. The system components were depicted as part of rich pictures and linked to the subsequent derived conceptual model of the overall system as an outline for the development of the specific FMIS requirements. This research has shown the benefit of using dedicated system analysis methodologies as a preliminary step to the actual design of a novel farm management information system compared with other more rigid and activity oriented system analysis methods.

A feasibility study in Switzerland	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						infodemic; critical health literacy; argumentation skills; scientific literacy; critical thinking	SCIENCE; PERSPECTIVE; VALIDATION; MOOD	ObjectivesWe aimed to develop and test the feasibility of a critical health literacy (CHL) and science literacy (SL) training course targeting secondary school students in Switzerland.MethodsUsing a community-based participatory approach, we developed a two-block training program, the first centered on argumentation skills and the second on scientific skills. We combined an ex-cathedra and a flipped-classroom approach, providing students with a deep understanding of CHL and SL concepts and the translational capability of implementing theoretical notions to real case scenarios. The feasibility study was designed as a one-group pretest-posttest quasi-experiment. Beyond socio-demographics, questionnaires included measures of CHL, SL, trust in science, and perceived quality of the course.ResultsThe curriculum was feasible and well-accepted by the target groups, teachers, and students. Students convincingly specified their perceived personal benefits associated with a positive change in CHL and SL scores after the training course.ConclusionTraining CHL and SL in secondary school students is feasible and can improve their competencies. Results from present study can inform a large-scale study.

But in general, programming learning has been focused on programming language features and it also gave a heavy cognitive load to learners. Therefore, this paper proposes a programming activity process to improve novice programming learners' algorithmic thinking efficiently. An experiment was performed to measure the effectiveness of the proposed programming activity process. After the experiment, the learners' perception on programming was shown to be changed, to effective activity in improving problem solving.

The Sunrise Research Laboratory at RMIT was given a brief in 1992 to awaken awareness within the university community of the opportunities which. exist in the presence of personal, portable computing. This project has involved 70 academics in discovering ways of making the curriculum more flexible and open, as well as more global and personal. New ways of teaching and presenting material for students to learn have evolved and the general attitude towards more student control of their educational process has changed at least in perception, and often also in practice. In addition, the use of the portable computer as a communications device which gives access to multimedia, interactive material has been fostered to raise awareness of the ways in which educational institutions can shift their base from their own local, institutionally owned facilities to public, internationally distributed facilities. The support service providers at RMIT, for instance the library, have started to develop new forms of services for students and staff, and new ways of thinking about the management of teaching and learning are being generated as new possibilities are critically evaluated within the educational framework. In this paper, I take the opportunity to describe some of the highlights of the journey, and attempt to provide a critical commentary which will help others endeavouring to undertake similar journeys.

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to establish the extent to which managing processes, rather than functions and units, as technology based innovation initiatives monitored by lean approach, impacts the improvement of picking performance. In this case, a realistic experiment was conducted in a company that adopted process and lean way of thinking in replacing RF scanning with voice technology. For the purpose of the research, apart from the data collected from the company, six participants were employed for the experiment. The results suggest that process innovation monitored by lean in adopting voice technology optimized order picking performance, leading to better efficiency, productivity and accuracy.

Design/Methodology/approach: An exploratory case study was conducted on 'Agricultural Knowledge Centers' (AKCs) in four offices of agriculture in South Wollo zone, Ethiopia. AKCs are access points for online and offline information sources. Data were collected using in-depth interviews, and a structured questionnaire, which we analyzed using descriptive statistics and the three concepts of the Theory of Planned Behavior: attitude, social norms, and perceived behavioral control. Findings: In the study site, young male extension experts with university education predominantly used ICTs. Extension experts had a favorable attitude towards the usefulness of ICTs for personal benefits. However, they saw little use of ICTs for searching agricultural information because they thought the printed agricultural knowledge resources at their offices are sufficient for their needs. The main factors that contributed to experts' use of ICTs are, the existing extension approach, the opinion of supervisors and the internet speed. Practical implications: While access to ICTs is a prerequisite, there is no guarantee that they will be used professionally to improve services. Users' perceived needs, skills and knowledge, and the organizational environment which encourages use should be considered when introducing ICTs. Theoretical implication: This paper contributes to the theoretical debate on the importance of users' perception of technologies like ICTs to achieve their full potential in agricultural extension. Originality/Value: This paper connects empirical findings on use of ICTs in agricultural extension with the literature on the contribution of behavioral factors when using technology.

Translating episodic future thinking manipulations for clinical use: Development of a clinical control	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ENERGY-INTAKE; PROSPECTION; PSYCHOTHERAPY; POWERFUL; PLACEBO	Many studies support that Episodic Future Thinking (EFT) reduces maladaptive health behaviors and how much individuals devalue the future (steepness of delay discounting). In order to understand the clinical utility of EFT, a control procedure that equates groups in non-specific treatment factors (e.g., expectancy of change, perceived connection of content to health behavior) is needed. The present research evaluated the effects of EFT relative to a novel control (health information thinking; HIT), which was designed to be structurally similar to EFT while incorporating elements from existing clinical controls. In a sample of Amazon Mechanical Turk workers (N= 254), we found that EFT reduced discounting relative to the HIT procedure and a standard EFT control. There were some affective differences across groups and differences in adherence to the intervention content, but these were unrelated to discounting. Delay discounting was not equivalent across the control groups, but this may not be a necessary condition to fulfill for a clinical control. Future research will need to identify whether the HIT procedure serves as a good control for other dependent variables when studying EFT and develop controls analogous to usual care or a "wait-list" in clinical contexts.

The case study of alternative bread supply chains in France	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Integrative design; Life cycle assessment; Eco-design; Longitudinal LCA; Alternative food supply chains	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; FOOD NETWORKS; SYSTEMS; SUSTAINABILITY; TRANSITIONS; CHALLENGES; THINKING	LCA studies reveal emission hotspots along the whole product value chain allowing the researcher to identify opportunities for improvements. Its combination with integrative design offers an opportunity to substantially improve the eco-efficiency. We describe the multi-stakeholder design process that was followed to provide reductions in resource use and emissions from two alternative bread supply chains in France. Case studies of alternative bread were selected because of strong motivation to improve environmental performance and the limited number of actors along the supply chain: farmers are also processors, distributors and retailers. The structured process of integrative design was supported by the use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as an evaluation and information support tool. To avoid any potential burden shifting, environmental impacts were tracked for 13 impact categories. Results of LCA with highlights of processes responsible for the largest share of environmental impacts were disclosed to experts during the collaborative design workshop. Stakeholders included sustainability experts, plant breeders, agronomists and representatives of farmers associations. In the next step, generated improvement scenarios were donsulted with farmers on a feedback loop basis. Despite the low acceptance of expert suggestions, the supply of environmental information allowed farmers to find some innovative design solutions. Conservative modelling of approved improvement scenarios revealed 47% potential reduction in the global warming potential in one of the value chains and 40% for aquatic eutrophication potential in the other one. Results of these case studies suggest that in addition to biophysical limitations, some producers may suffer from the lack of innovation, suboptimal management and the lack of access to reliable environmental information. Integrative approaches coupled with systematic, science based assessment tools such as LCA can be effective in overcoming some of these barriers and improving eco-efficiency. More research is needed to understand the social factors driving the life-cycle based eco-innovation on farms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Through an atomic-layered component architecture, GAV Flash provides a collection of interactive geographic and information visualization representations for exploring high-dimensional spaces that are extended with motion behaviour. Versatile interaction methods are drawn from many data visualization research areas and optimized for dynamic web visualization of spatio-temporal and multivariate data. Based on layered-component thinking and the use of programming interface mechanism, the GAV Flash architecture is open and facilitates the creation of new or improved versions of existing components so that ideas can be tried out or optimized rapidly in a fully functional environment. GAV Flash is not only a tool for interactive visualization, it also supports storytelling around visual analytics in which visual representations serve not only as a discovery tool for individuals but also as a means to share stories among users fostering a social style of collaborative data analysis. A mechanism 'snapshot' for saving the explorative results of a reasoning process is introduced, which aids collaboration and publication of gained insight and knowledge embedded as dynamic visualizations in blogs or web pages with associative metadata or 'storytelling'.

J	Wang, JK; Li, Y				Wang, Jiakun; Li, Yun			Research on the propagation and governance of public opinion information under the joint action of internal and external factors	ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Public opinion information; Propagation; Online social networks; Internal factors; External factors; Governance strategy	DYNAMICS; NETWORKS; MEDIA; MODEL	Purpose Under the new media environment, while enjoying the convenience brought by the propagation of public opinion information (referred to as public opinion), learning the evolution process of public opinion and strengthening the governance of the spreading of public opinion are of great significance to promoting economic development and maintaining social stability as well as effectively resisting the negative impact of its propagation. Design/methodology/approach Thinking about the results of empirical research and bibliometric analysis, this paper focused on introducing key factors such as information content, social strengthening effects, etc., from both internal and external levels, dynamically designed public opinion spreading rules and netizens' state transition probability. Subsequently, simulation experiments were conducted to discuss the spreading law of public opinion in two types of online social networks and to identify the key factors which influencing its evolution process. Based on the experimental results, the governance strategies for the propagation of negative public opinion were proposed finally. Findings The results show that compared with other factors, the propagation of public opinion depends more on the attributes of the information content itself. For the propagation of negative public opinion, on the one hand, the regulators should adopt flexible guidance strategy to establish a public opinion supervision mechanism and autonomous system with universal participation. On the other hand, they still need to adopt rigid governance strategy, focusing on the governance timing and netizens with higher network status to forestall the wide-diffusion of public opinion. Practical implications The research conclusions put forward the enlightenment for the governance of public opinion in management practice, and also provided decision-making reference for the regulators to reasonably respond to the propagation of public opinion. Originality/value Our research proposed a research framework for the discussion of public opinion propagation process and had important practical guiding significance for the governance of public opinion propagation.

By treating such developments as critically informed social systems, this paper offers an alternative viewpoint. Firstly, a theoretical justification for such an approach is offered, drawing on developments in Critical Management Science, themselves based on a strand of Critical Social Theory. Secondly, an action research-based intervention is detailed, demonstrating the practical applicability of such an approach, an applicability that has hitherto been questioned. The outcome is a synthesised approach to operational and strategic information systems development, within a critical framework, which, it is argued offers a greater potential for success than the currently promoted approaches.

Horses, saddles and riders: Applying the science	EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION			English	Editorial Material							EQUINE; KINEMATICS; LAMENESS	An enthusiastic crowd of 400 people gathered at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, UK on 29 November 2014 for the second International Saddle Research Trust Conference on the theme of Horses, Saddles and Riders: Applying the Science. The conference was organised under the auspices of the Saddle Research Trust (SRT) which is a charitable organisation based in the UK established with the intention of stimulating and supporting research into the influence of saddles on the welfare, performance and safety of horses and riders using objective scientific methods. The SRT aims to provide a coordinated, focused approach to research in these areas, to facilitate publication of the findings in scientific journals and dissemination of the results to the equestrian world. This approach allows the SRT to act as a link between research, education and the industry. The trust supports research into all aspects of the interaction between the horse, saddle and rider. Areas of specific recent interest include studying welfare, performance and safety issues related to the use of a saddle, the role of the saddle in equine and human back problems, characterising behavioural issues of horses associated with saddle-related discomfort, assessing the effects of saddle design on rider performance and health and designing saddles for disabled riders. Further information about the SRT is available on the website . Sponsors of the conference were World Horse Welfare, a practical and forward-thinking charity that believes in using scientific evidence to help guide its work, Amerigo saddlers, a company that advocates research as a basis for improving product design, the British Equestrian Federation (BEF) and Horse and Hound.

J	Schlager, T; Hildebrand, C; Häubl, G; Franke, N; Herrmann, A				Schlager, Tobias; Hildebrand, Christian; Haubl, Gerald; Franke, Nikolaus; Herrmann, Andreas			Social Product-Customization Systems: Peer Input, Conformity, and Consumers' Evaluation of Customized Products	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						conformity; electronic commerce; information processing; product customization; similarity-attraction theory; social impact theory; social networks; thinking styles	USER COMMUNITIES; SIMILARITY; ONLINE; DESIGN; SATISFACTION; CONTRIBUTE; THOUGHT; IMPACT; MEDIA; TESTS	Many product-customization systems enable consumers to obtain input from their peers during the customization process. The design characteristics of these customization systems vary significantly, and some systems provide consumers with the opportunity to receive peer input only privately (i.e., unobservable to fellow consumers) while others allow consumers to receive peer input publicly (i.e., observable to other consumers). Building on prior research on thinking styles and social impact theory, the current work examines the interplay between user, social network, and system design characteristics in social product-customization systems as drivers of whether consumers conform to input received from others on their customized products and of their evaluation of these products. Evidence from one field study and four experiments shows that consumers with more holistic (vs. analytic) thinking styles make more conforming product modifications when receiving public rather than private peer input, and this greater conformity to peer input boosts (vs. diminishes) consumers' evaluation of customized products when they feel close (vs. distant) to input providers. These findings offer novel insights into how the design of social product-customization systems affects consumers' evaluation of customized products.

Also, sustainability in the building sector is important since this business has a big influence on the environment and contributes significantly to socioeconomic growth specifically in Commercial Building. In terms of building sustainability, environmental issues are important issues in the early design stage, in which the principles of safety of structures, probabilistic reliability and durability are involved. A new integrated-design method that permits building analysis from a multi-performance view is regarded necessary to advance the sustainability. In this scenario, the environmental methodologies and footprint schemes for determining building sustainability are investigated using only a decision-making (DM) process on the basis of sustainable triple bottom line structure, which incorporates economic efficiency, resource conserving, and design for human adaption. The framework would enable design teams to achieve an optimal balance between social, environmental, and economic challenges, altering the path of construction practitioners' thought about the information used while appraising building projects, thereby aiding the sustainability of building industry. Finally, the technique of DM utilized in those decisions would influence the final building design, and hence the project's environmental, economic and social results.

As Computer Science (CS) Education is undergoing curricular reforms worldwide, the present study addresses the case of a Digital Education reform that included ER as a means to teach core CS concepts. Approximately 350 teachers from the first four grades of primary school participated in a mandatory two-year continuing professional development (CPD) program. The first year of the program was dedicated to CS and introduced teachers to CS Unplugged (CSU) and Robotics Unplugged (RU) activities. As such, we analyse the interplay between these activities and focus on teachers' voluntary adoption of the proposed content in classrooms. This is complemented by an analysis of their perception and recommendation of ER. The findings highlight three main points. Firstly, ER benefits from the integration in the CS CPD, as this provides the necessary traction to introduce ER into teacher practices (the teachers freely devoted 2275 h to ER activities in their classrooms, over two years). Secondly, the presence of ER activities in the CS-CPD allows a higher proportion of teachers to adopt the CS content, as there are teachers that favour one type of activity over the other. Finally, the globally positive perception of ER registered in this study is relevant for two reasons: teachers were not voluntarily participating in the CPD, and results did not differ between pioneers and novices.

Context-sensitive thinking influences judgments of expected satiation from combinations of foods: The role of individual and cultural variations	JOURNAL OF SENSORY STUDIES			English	Article							ENERGY-INTAKE; PORTION-SIZE; MEAL-SIZE; PERCEPTION; SELECTION; THOUGHT; WEIGHT; STYLES; MEN	Prior research has suggested the influence of thinking styles in judgments of foods, with individual and cultural differences. Here, we tested whether context sensitivity may influence judgments of a food's basic characteristics (e.g., expected satiation) in the presence of other foods in the surrounding context. Given their greater sensitivity to contextual information, participants from Singapore (compared with the USA) perceived central/focal food items as more satiating when surrounded by other foods that were low (vs. high) in expected satiation-a tendency positively correlated with measures of holistic and interdependent thinking styles (Study 1). Judgments of a central food were influenced by the foods surrounding it when participants had been experimentally primed into high context sensitivity (vs. low context sensitivity) (Study 2). These findings reveal that context-sensitivity may contribute to the emergence of individual and cultural diversity in consumers' perceptions and judgments about multiple foods that are encountered together. Practical Applications Although context sensitivity is well known for its implications on perceptions and judgments, rarely has it been extended to judgments of food-a domain of everyday life with numerous health implications. We demonstrate how context sensitivity may guide food judgments in the presence of multiple discrete food items in the surrounding context (e.g., a multi-food meal or display). We show that context sensitivity, both as a tendency that varies across cultures and as a situationally malleable style of cognition, may lead to evaluations of a focal food item in a group being influenced by perceived characteristics of surrounding foods. Given its cultural variance and situational malleability, context sensitivity may be a promising consumer-oriented target when designing food-related environments (e.g., food displays or mealscapes), especially in cultures which place greater emphasis on contextual information as a routine in daily thought.

Age, mental health status and childlessness are the factors known to mostly affect women's levels of grief. OBJECTIVES: To assess the levels of grief among women who experienced perinatal loss and the changes in their ruminative thought styles over the first year after their loss. DESIGN AND SETTING: One-year follow-up study carried out in a university hospital in Turkey. METHODS: The study population included 70 women who experienced loss of pregnancy in the hospital. The sample size was calculated using G*Power V3.1. Data were collected at 48 hours, at the third month, at the sixth month and at one year after pregnancy loss, between June 2018 and June 2019. A personal information form, the Perinatal Grief Scale and the Ruminative Thought Style Questionnaire were used for data collection. RESULTS: The women's highest levels of grief and ruminative thought style were in the first 48 hours. Their tendency towards grief and ruminative thought styles decreased over the repeated measurements during the follow-up. Women aged 20-29 years had the highest levels of grief at the third month after perinatal loss. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing assessments regarding grief and ruminative thought style over the first 48 hours after perinatal loss should be integrated into nursing care for these women. Grief follow-up programs for these women can be developed through nursing research.

Subsequently, it examines how participation in the course influences pre-service teachers' dispositions and knowledge of computational thinking concepts and the ways in which such knowledge can be combined with content and pedagogy to promote meaningful student outcomes. Data were collected from a self-reported survey and case reports focusing on the design, implementation, and outcomes of computational thinking related lessons in K-8 classrooms. Results indicated that the course positively influenced pre-service teachers' knowledge of computational thinking concepts, tools, and practices. Yet, some participants demonstrated only surface understanding of computational thinking and were unable to design lessons that meaningfully integrated computational thinking concepts and tools with disciplinary content and pedagogy. Findings have implications for the design of teacher education experiences that help prepare pre-service teachers develop technological pedagogical content knowledge in relation to computational thinking concepts and practices.

Designing a persuasive physical activity application for older workers: understanding end-user perceptions	BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Persuasive system design; behaviour change support system; physical activity application; older workers; design requirements	SELF-EFFICACY; HYPERTENSION	Among the factors known to encourage healthy ageing is routine physical activity, a behaviour that is not common among the older age group. A Persuasive System Design (PSD) model offers guidelines for designing and evaluating systems aimed at reinforcing, changing or shaping underlying human behaviour and attitudes. The objective of this study was to investigate the perceptions of older workers towards persuasive principles of PSD that was integrated into an application specifically designed to encourage physical activity. Ten older workers aged 50-64 years with different physical activity levels participated in this study. Using a think-aloud technique, the participants interacted with a physical activity application, while verbally expressing their perceptions towards the persuasive elements. The results indicated that the older worker participants had positive views towards persuasive design principles that fell under the categories of primary task, dialogue support and credibility support. However, the persuasive principle of the social support category received contradictory views. Further, it was discovered that the personalisation of persuasive principles, the credibility of tailored contents and the establishment of a sense of similarity are imperative in the designing of effective persuasive physical activity applications targeting older workers.

Sharing treatment-related information and communicating among different PPC professionals is critical to ensure good quality of care. In Germany, this communication is mostly paper-based and prone to errors. Therefore, an electronic cross-facility health record (ECHR) was participatorily designed with users, wherein information can be shared and PPC professionals can communicate with each other. As this form of electronic health record differs from existing models in Germany, there is a need for successful implementation to ensure a positive impact. Therefore, the facilitators and barriers to the implementation of ECHR in PPC were examined. Using the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR), transcripts of 32 interviews, 3 focus groups, and 20 think-aloud studies with PPC professionals were analyzed. CFIR indicated that the ECHR-design was viewed positively by users and can be a facilitator for implementation. Barriers exist, mainly due to the fact that the implementation is not planned, the use of the ECHR involves effort, costs are not covered, and all users must be motivated to use the ECHR for functionality. CFIR helps uncover the crux of the issues that need to be considered when planning ECHR implementation to improve care in PPC.

As a result, a comprehensive understanding of their sexual reproduction is of great interest. Central to this is the identification of the reproductive strategies used by morels. Sexual reproduction in fungi is controlled by mating-type (MAT) genes and morels are thought to be mainly heterothallic with two idiomorphs, MAT1-1 and MAT1-2. Genomic sequencing of black (Elata clade) and yellow (Esculenta clade) morel species has led to the development of PCR primers designed to amplify genes from the two idiomorphs for rapid genotyping of isolates from these two clades. To evaluate the design and theoretical performance of these primers we performed a thorough bioinformatic investigation, including the detection of the MAT region in publicly available Morchella genomes and in-silico PCR analyses. All examined genomes, including those used for primer design, appeared to be heterothallic. This indicates an inherent fault in the original primer design which utilized a single Morchella genome, as the use of two genomes with complementary mating types would be required to design accurate primers for both idiomorphs. Furthermore, potential off-targets were identified for some of the previously published primer sets, but verification was challenging due to lack of adequate genomic information and detailed methodologies for primer design. Examinations of the black morel specific primer pairs (MAT11L/R and MAT22L/R) indicated the MAT22 primers would correctly target and amplify the MAT1-2 idiomorph, but the MAT11 primers appear to be capable of amplifying incorrect off-targets within the genome. The yellow morel primer pairs (EMAT1-1 L/R and EMAT1-2 L/R) appear to have reporting errors, as the published primer sequences are dissimilar with reported amplicon sequences and the EMAT1-2 primers appear to amplify the RNA polymerase II subunit (RPB2) gene. The lack of the reference genome used in primer design and descriptive methodology made it challenging to fully assess the apparent issues with the primers for this clade. In conclusion, additional work is still required for the generation of reliable primers to investigate mating types in morels and to assess their performance on different clades and across multiple geographical regions.

Reducing ethnic and racial disparities by improving undertreatment, control, and engagement in blood pressure management with health information technology (REDUCE-BP) hybrid effectiveness-implementation pragmatic trial: Rationale and design	AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL			English	Article							CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; UNCONTROLLED HYPERTENSION; CLINICAL INERTIA; CARE; INTERVENTION; ADHERENCE; POPULATION; PHYSICIAN; ADOPTION; IMPACT	Background While racial/ethnic disparities in blood pressure control are documented, few interventions have successfully reduced these gaps. Under-prescribing, lack of treatment intensification, and suboptimal follow-up care are thought to be central contributors. Electronic health record (EHR) tools may help address these barriers and may be enhanced with behavioral science techniques. Objective To evaluate the impact of a multicomponent behaviorally-informed EHR-based intervention on blood pressure control. Trial Design Reducing Ethnic and racial Disparities by improving Undertreatment, Control, and Engagement in Blood Pressure management with health information technology (REDUCE-BP) (NCT05030467) is a two-arm cluster-randomized hybrid type 1 pragmatic trial in a large multi-ethnic health care system. Twenty-four clinics ( >350 primary care providers [PCPs] and >10,000 eligible patients) are assigned to either multi-component EHR-based intervention or usual care. Intervention clinic PCPs will receive several EHR tools designed to reduce disparities delivered at different points, including a: (1) dashboard of all patients visible upon logging on to the EHR displaying blood pressure control by race/ethnicity compared to their PCP peers and (2) set of tools in an individual patient's chart containing decision support to encourage treatment intensification, ordering home blood pressure measurement, interventions to address health-related social needs, default text for note documentation, and enhanced patient education materials. The primary outcome is patient-level change in systolic blood pressure over 12 months between arms; secondary outcomes include changes in disparities and other clinical outcomes. Conclusion REDUCE-BP will provide important insights into whether an EHR-based intervention designed using behavioral science can improve hypertension control and reduce disparities.

Residents Think in the "Now" and Supervisors Think Ahead in the Operating Room. A Survey Study About Task Perception of Residents and Supervising Surgeons	JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Surgical education; Intraprocedural variation; Workplace-based learning and teaching; Faculty development	EXPERTISE; MODEL	OBJECTIVE: Progressive autonomous task performance is the cornerstone of teaching residents in the operating room, where they are entrusted with autonomy when they meet their supervisors' preferences. To optimize the teaching, supervisors need to be aware of how residents experience parts of the procedure. This study provides insight into how supervisors and residents perceive different tasks of a single surgical procedure. DESIGN: In this qualitative survey study a cognitive task analysis (CTA) of supervisors and residents for the 47 tasks of an uncemented total hip arthroplasty was executed. Both groups rated the level of attention they would assign to each task and were asked to explain attention scores of 4 or 5. SETTING: University Medical Centre Groningen (the Netherlands) and its 5 affiliated teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen supervising surgeons and 21 residents. RESULTS: Normal attention (median attention score 3) was assigned by supervisors to 34 tasks (72.3%) and by residents to 35 tasks (74.5 %). Supervisors rated 12 tasks (25.6%) and residents 9 tasks (19.1%) with a median attention score of 4. In general, supervisors associated high attention with patient outcome and prevention of complications, while residents associated high attention with "effort." CONCLUSIONS: Supervisors and residents assigned attention to tasks for different reasons. Supervisors think ahead and emphasize patient outcome and prevention of complications when they indicate high attention, while residents think in the "now" and raise attention to execute the tasks themselves. The results of this study allow residents and supervisors to anticipate preferences: residents are able to appreciate why supervisors increase attention to specific tasks, and supervisors obtain information on which tasks require individual guidance of residents. This information can contribute to improve the learning climate in the operating room and task-specific procedural training.

J	Jemine, G; Pichault, F; Dubois, C				Jemine, Gregory; Pichault, Francois; Dubois, Christophe			The politics behind design projects: when space, organization, and technology collide	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Design process; New ways of working; NWoW; NWW; Triple design; Project management; Organizational change; Organizational politics	INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT; WORKPLACE; THINKING; SCIENCE; ENVIRONMENTS; INNOVATION; TYPOLOGY; EXPLORATION; RETHINKING	Purpose While more and more organizations commit to transformation projects with the aim of redesigning simultaneously their workspaces, work organization, and technologies, the design process supporting such projects remains largely understudied. This paper examines the political tensions that occur when such processes unfold as well as their implications for project management. By doing so, the paper counterbalances the prescriptive and normative literature on "New Ways of Working" which largely overlooks the political complexity of such projects. Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on a qualitative study of a triple design process in a media company. Data collection mainly consists of a nine-month process of non-participant observation of weekly meetings held by the strategic group in charge of the project. Semi-structured interviews with members of the executive committee have also been conducted. Findings The analysis illustrates how space, organization and technology are gradually designed and structured. Four interconnected and often concealed mechanisms that support triple design processes are identified: political tensions, unexpected twists, conflicting temporalities and arbitration measures. Originality/value The originality of the paper lies in breaking down the concept of design in three separate objects - organization, space and technology - and examining how these objects were conjointly problematized by an organization in transformation, whereas existing studies often investigate organization design, space design or technology design in isolation.

J	Giachelle, F; Dosso, D; Silvello, G				Giachelle, Fabio; Dosso, Dennis; Silvello, Gianmaria			Search, access, and explore life science nanopublications on the Web	PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Nanopublication; Scientific data; Graph exploration; Data search; Data citation; Data exploration; Data access	KEYWORD-BASED SEARCH; DATABASES; NEXTPROT	Nanopublications are Resource Description Framework (RDF) graphs encoding scientific facts extracted from the literature and enriched with provenance and attribution information. There are millions of nanopublications currently available on the Web, especially in the life science domain. Nanopublications are thought to facilitate the discovery, exploration, and re-use of scientific facts. Nevertheless, they are still not widely used by scientists outside specific circles; they are hard to find and rarely cited. We believe this is due to the lack of services to seek, find and understand nanopublications' content. To this end, we present the NanoWeb application to seamlessly search, access, explore, and re-use the nanopublications publicly available on the Web. For the time being, NanoWeb focuses on the life science domain where the vastest amount of nanopublications are available. It is a unified access point to the world of nanopublications enabling search over graph data, direct connections to evidence papers, and scientific curated databases, and visual and intuitive exploration of the relation network created by the encoded scientific facts.

Research into other belief systems suggests that the endorsement of non-evidence based beliefs, such as the paranormal or conspiracy theories, can be reduced when people think more analytically. The purpose of this study was to explore whether an intervention designed to elicit analytical thinking was effective in altering the gambling beliefs and simulated gambling behaviour of 178 regular electronic gaming machine (EGM) gamblers (102 males, 76 female). Participants were randomly allocated to complete either an analytic or a neutral priming task, followed by completion of belief measures (erroneous and protective) and play on a simulated EGM game. Results failed to show that priming for analytical thinking changed betting on an EGM; including features of bet size, bet change, persistence and theoretical losses. Contrary to expectations, results suggest that priming analytical thinking using generalised interventions does not appear to be effective in altering peoples' simulated gambling involvement or gambling beliefs. In fact, priming people to think more critically might be counterproductive by contributing to greater positive expectations about gambling outcomes. The results further suggested that the number of times a player alters their bet is a good indicator of theoretical gambling losses and is associated with irrational gambling cognitions. Interventions designed to promote safer thinking in gamblers should be implemented with care, as results from our study suggest that encouraging critical thinking in at-risk or problem gamblers may not be effective in reducing risky gambling.

Design Ideator: A Conceptual Design Toolbox	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							GENERATION; FIXATION	Computer tools for embodiment and detailed engineering design (computer-aided design (CAD)) evolved rapidly in the past 35 years and are now pervasive throughout the industry. But todays commercial CAD is geometry-centric, not appropriate for early stages of design when detailed geometry and dimensions are not known. This paper describes a framework and a set of interconnected tools for conceptual design. In this system, a broad range of intuitive and experiential concept generation methods have been operationalized and implemented as databases, artifact repositories, knowledge bases, and interactive procedures to promote divergent thinking. The so-called "Design Ideator" includes methods for flexible and dynamic design problem formulation, re-formulation, and restructuring in the form of hierarchical and re-configurable morphological charts. This tool has been continuously enhanced through three phases of user studies and feedback. The main contributions of this work are as follows. First, this research has created a holistic framework with interlaced knowledge bases from a wide range of methods, as opposed to past research that have relied on single experiential only method. Second, we have formulated algorithms to support several intuitive methods, such as contextual shifting, analogical reasoning, provocative stimuli, and combinatorial play.

The current generation of teenagers has grown up in a networked world where everyone is immersed in technology-based gadgets in everyday life. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate video game-based academic and information literacy (IL) learning of teenagers of private schools of Lahore city. Lahore is the capital city of the province of Punjab. Literary works highlighted the importance of video games in developing academic and IL skills; therefore, the current research aims to reveal this fact in local context. Design/methodology/approach The present study adopted qualitative research design and utilized phenomenological research method to achieve study's objectives. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews. The study participants were teenagers (aged 13-19 years) of elite economic class of private schools where students normally owned latest video game gadgets. Findings Based on the study findings, it is elucidated that playing video games has a positive impact on teenagers' learning, and it promotes quick thinking. The participants exert effort to achieve goals, take up challenges for completing different points at various stages of games and interact with online competitors. It enhanced their social communication, problem-solving and IL (searching/locating and evaluating) skills. Research limitations/implications The present study has some limitations. First, sample is limited to elite economic private schools of Lahore. Second, the lack of availability of regular video game players has limited the sample size, as Pakistan is a developing country and limited numbers of teenagers use and can afford gaming gadgets. Lastly, the results of this study are based on students' perceptions, so there is a need to measure actual learning with assessments. Originality/value The results of the study are beneficial for the game developers, teachers, librarians and parents. The education sector may support video games usability as learning tools.

Sanitary Sewer Design Using EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM)	COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						SWMM; sanitary sewer; hydraulic model		Traditional sanitary sewer design uses detailed design tables that contain all the necessary information to complete the design. An alternative approach is to use modeling software, such as the EPA SWMM model. This paper details the application of the EPA SWMM model to design the sanitary sewer system of a proposed 62 lot development. Typically SWMM is thought of almost exclusively as a storm water system analysis tool, but this application shows how it can also be used for sanitary sewer analysis and design. The paper details how the SWMM model parameters were set to handle infiltration and inflow as well as base residential sanitary flows. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals: Inc.

Using scenario-based testing with think-aloud protocols, we evaluated the usability of portals for parents of children with cystic fibrosis, diabetes or arthritis. Design: Sixteen parents used a prototype and test data to complete 14 tasks followed by a validated satisfaction questionnaire. Three iterations of the prototype were used. Measurements: During the usability testing, we measured the time it took participants to complete or give up on each task. Sessions were videotaped and content-analyzed for common themes. Following testing, participants completed the Computer Usability Satisfaction Questionnaire which measured their opinions on the efficiency of the system, its ease of use, and the likability of the system interface. A 7-point Likert scale was used, with seven indicating the highest possible satisfaction. Results: Mean task completion times ranged from 73 (+/- 61) seconds to locate a document to 431 (+/- 286) seconds to graph laboratory results. Tasks such as graphing, location of data, requesting access, and data interpretation were challenging. Satisfaction was greatest for interface pleasantness (5.9 +/- 0.7) and likeability (5.8 +/- 0.6) and lowest for error messages (2.3 +/- 1.2) and clarity of information (4.2 +/- 1.4). Overall mean satisfaction scores improved between iteration one and three. Conclusions: Despite parental involvement and prior heuristic testing, scenario-based testing demonstrated difficulties in navigation, medical language complexity, error recovery, and provider-based organizational schema. While such usability testing can be expensive, the current study demonstrates that it can assist in making healthcare system interfaces for laypersons more user-friendly and potentially more functional for patients and their families.

J	Burford, S				Burford, Sally			Complexity and the Practice of Web Information Architecture	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								This article describes the outcomes of research that examined the practice of web information architecture (IA) in large organizations. Using a grounded theory approach, seven large organizations were investigated and the data were analyzed for emerging themes and concepts. The research finds that the practice of web IA is characterized by unpredictability, multiple perspectives, and a need for responsiveness, agility, and negotiation. This article claims that web IA occurs in a complex environment and has emergent, self-organizing properties. There is value in examining the practice as a complex adaptive system. Using this metaphor, a pre-determined, structured methodology that delivers a documented, enduring, information design for the web is found inadequate - dominant and traditional thinking and practice in the organization of information are challenged.

How do people in China think about causes of their back pain? A predominantly qualitative cross-sectional survey	BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Lumbar; Pain beliefs; Pain perception; China; Cultural sensitivity; Discourse analysis; Thinking patterns; Psychosocial; Rehabilitation; Disability	FEAR-AVOIDANCE BELIEFS; GLOBAL BURDEN; DISABILITY; PREVALENCE; COUNTRIES; MEDICINE; EFFICACY; DISC; CARE	Background Low back pain (LBP) is the second highest cause of health burden in China. Delayed recovery, poor clinical outcomes and persistence of LBP are associated with negative pain beliefs about LBP. Chinese philosophies are nested into the daily life of people in China, which is likely to influence pain beliefs. However, there is lack of knowledge about people's discourses regarding their LBP in China. The primary aim of this study was to explore the discourses underlying the beliefs of people in China about what causes their persistent or recurrent LBP. The secondary aim was to investigate the sources of these pain beliefs. Methods People (n = 152) from South Central, East and North Mainland China with LBP completed an online survey about what they believed caused their persistent or recurrent LBP and where these understandings came from. Potential causes of persistent or recurrent LBP were explored qualitatively using discourse analysis. The sources of these discourses were assessed by descriptive statistics with conventional content analysis. Results Five discourses were identified to underpin participants' beliefs about what caused their persistent or recurrent LBP, namely: (1) biomedical problems (66.4%), (2) unbalanced lifestyle (48.7%), (3) menstruation and 'kidney' status (9.2%), (4) the 'Five Elements' imbalance (7.9%), and (5) energy status (5.9%). Most participants responded that their pain beliefs were based on information derived from healthcare professionals (59.2%), followed by the internet (24.3%) and family (23.0%). Conclusions People from moderately and well-developed parts of Mainland China think predominantly in line with a Western biomedical viewpoint about their LBP. Traditional Chinese medicine related pain beliefs mainly to the concept of 'balance' were evident on contemporary Chinese society's understandings of LBP. These cultural beliefs could be relevant to consider in LBP management and involve healthcare professionals, family and patient in this process.

Among the most used pedagogical methods in the educational field is the collaborative learning. The general objective of the present investigation is to know the performance and academic development of the term "collaborative learning" in the documents collected in the Web of Science database. The research method developed was based on a bibliometric study, identifying academic performance and conceptual development, through a co-word analysis. Particularly, we have pursued four main objectives: (a) To determine the degree of performance of documents collected from collaborative learning; (b) to identify the scientific development of so-called collaborative learning; (c) to analyze the most incidental aspects of collaborative learning; and (d) to value the most representative authors who are experts in the use of collaborative learning. The total number of manuscripts studied is 3295. The results show the manuscripts are written mainly in English by researchers who belong from the United States. The main area of knowledge is Education Educational Research. As a conclusion, it can be said that the collaborative learning pedagogical method is at a turning point in the scientific field. Its scientific evolution, focused on its principles in the students themselves, has extended to other branches. At present, studies are oriented towards technological resources, co-regulation, and the academic achievements of students. Furthermore, in the coming years the terms innovation, design, patterns, collaboration, and communication will probably be the new lines of study in this scientific field.

Motivating Adherence to Exercise Plans Through a Personalized Mobile Health App: Enhanced Action Design Research Approach	JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH			English	Article						adherence; mobile health; motivation; personality; MBTI; action design research; mobile phone	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; MERE EXPOSURE; REPETITION; INFORMATION; SMOKING; IMPACT; ATTRACTIVENESS; EXPERTISE; FREQUENCY; MESSAGES	Background: Physical inactivity is a global issue that affects people's health and productivity. With the advancement of mobile technologies, many apps have been developed to facilitate health self-management. However, few studies have examined the effectiveness of these mobile health (mHealth) apps in motivating exercise adherence. Objective: This study aims to demonstrate the enhanced action design research (ADR) process and improve the design of mHealth apps for exercise self-management. Specifically, we investigate whether sending motivational messages improves adherence to exercise plans, whether the motivational effect is affected by personality, the impact of message type and repetition, and the process of involving a field experiment in the design process and learning new design principles from the results. Methods: This formative research was conducted by proposing an enhanced ADR process. We incorporated a field experiment into the process to iteratively refine and evaluate the design until it converges into a final mHealth app. We used the Apple ResearchKit to develop the mHealth app and promoted it via trainers at their gyms. We targeted users who used the app for at least two months. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the 12 groups in a 2 & times;3 & times;2 factorial design and remained blinded to the assigned intervention. The groups were defined based on personality type (thinking or feeling), message type (emotional, logical, or none), and repetition (none or once). Participants with different personality types received tailored and repeated messages. Finally, we used the self-reported completion rate to measure participants' adherence level to exercise plans. By analyzing users' usage patterns, we could verify, correct, and enhance the mHealth app design principles. Results: In total, 160 users downloaded the app, and 89 active participants remained during the 2-month period. The results suggest a significant main effect of personality type and repetition and a significant interaction effect between personality type and repetition. The adherence rate of people with feeling personality types was 18.15% higher than that of people with thinking types. Emotional messages were more effective than logical messages in motivating exercise adherence. Although people received repeated messages, they were more likely to adhere to exercise plans. With repeated reminders, the adherence rates of people with thinking personality types were significantly improved by 27.34% (P<.001). Conclusions: This study contributes to the literature on mHealth apps. By incorporating a field experiment into the ADR process, we demonstrate the benefit of combining design science and field experiments. This study also contributes to the research on mHealth apps. The principles learned from this study can be applied to improve the effectiveness of mHealth apps. The app design can be considered a foundation for the development of more advanced apps for specific diseases, such as diabetes and asthma, in future research.

J	Kramer, W; Skinner, D				Kramer, William; Skinner, David			AN EXASCALE APPROACH TO SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE DESIGN	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING APPLICATIONS			English	Article						software design; operating systems; performance measurement; resiliency; I/O		For the past 10-15 years, horizontal layers of software and hardware design and development have been the de facto standard of creating high-performance computing (HPC) software. The horizontal design approach leads to the development of discrete components in the software stack and independent hardware components-all developed with different methods, requirements and quality dominated by plug-and-play componentization that is focused on horizontal functionality and portability. The horizontal software paradigm will break down at the exascale due to the system scale and complexity. The vertical approach needed for the exascale should include resilience (reliability and fault tolerance); performance; programmability; computational models; I/O; consistency and verification; resource management; and power management/total cost of ownership. To make the exascale an effective reality, instead of thinking of integration as the final step in defining and developing an exascale system, it will have to be the first step.

J	Moulin, P; Wang, Y				Moulin, Pierre; Wang, Ying			Capacity and random-coding exponents for channel coding with side information	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						arbitrarily varying channels; broadcast channels; capacity; channel coding with side information; data hiding; error exponents; maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoding; method of types; random binning; randomized codes; reliability function; universal coding and decoding; watermarking	ARBITRARILY VARYING CHANNELS; ADDITIVE NOISE CHANNELS; ERROR EXPONENTS; WATERMARKING SYSTEMS; DUALITY; STATES; GAME	Capacity formulas and random-coding exponents are derived for a generalized family of Gel'fand-Pinsker coding problems. These exponents yield asymptotic upper bounds on the achievable log probability of error. In our model, information is to be reliably transmitted through a noisy channel with finite input and output alphabets and random state sequence, and the channel is selected by a hypothetical adversary. Partial information about the state sequence is available to the encoder, adversary, and decoder. The design of the transmitter is subject to a cost constraint. Two families of channels are considered: 1) compound discrete memoryless channels (CDMC), and 2) channels with arbitrary memory, subject to an additive cost constraint, or more generally, to a hard constraint on the conditional type of the channel output given the input. Both problems are closely connected. The random-coding exponent is achieved using a stacked binning scheme and a maximum penalized mutual information decoder, which may be thought of as an empirical generalized maximum a posteriori decoder. For channels with arbitrary memory, the random-coding exponents are larger than their CDMC counterparts. Applications of this study include watermarking, data hiding, communication in presence of partially known interferers, and problems such as broadcast channels, all of which involve the fundamental idea of binning.

Polymers and Cross-Linking: A CORE Experiment To Help Students Think on the Submicroscopic Level	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						First-Year Undergraduate; Laboratory Instruction; Analogies/Transfer; Inquiry-Based Learning; Constructivism; Hands-On Learning/Manipulatives	PAPER CLIPS; CHEMICAL-EQUILIBRIUM; ANALOGIES; CHEMISTRY; SCIENCE; BORAX; POLYVINYL-ALCOHOL); KNOWLEDGE; MODELS; MATTER	The Polymers and Cross-Linking experiment is presented via a new three phase learning cycle: CORE (Chemical Observations, Representations, Experimentation), which is designed to model productive chemical inquiry and to promote a deeper understanding about the chemistry operating at the submicroscopic level. The experiment is built on two familiar activities often used in public outreach: mixing solutions of poly(vinyl alcohol) and sodium borate, producing the substance known as "slime", and linking paper clips as an analogy to represent polymers. In phase 1 of the CORE experiment, students prepare slime, and explore the properties of the separate solutions and slime. In phase 2, students use analogical reasoning to think about a representation for considering the chemistry at the submicroscopic level. The analogy activity includes using an Analog to Target Worksheet to carefully consider similarities and differences between the analog (paper clip chains) and target (polymers). Phase 3 begins with pairs of students designing experiments in response to this question: How do different proportions of the two reactants, poly(vinyl alcohol) and sodium borate, affect the material properties of the new polymer that is formed? In a recent JCE paper, we report the capacity for students to engage in using analogical reasoning when conducting the Polymer and Cross-Linking experiment. In this paper, we include an analysis of a postlab question, asking students to propose an alternative analogy that could be used in the lab experiment. Detailed analysis of a subset (23 out of 312) of student-generated alternative analogies is provided in Supporting Information. Together with the previously published paper, the data provides insight into student thinking about using analogical reasoning in the Polymers and Cross-Linking CORE experiment.	[Bruce, Mitchell R.

Most often, incomplete or imprecise information on the deposit must be used to decide to continue or not with the development and implementation of a project. This paper presents a diagnostic methodology to deal with gold projects at the preliminary stages. We have developed "lntelliGold"-an expert system for gold process design. A knowledge base on gold mineralogy and processing is used to provide the user with feasibility information on a given gold ore. Decision-makers can have a preliminary, yet reliable view of the mineral processing project, based on lab results supported by mineralogical characteristics, operational issues and economic analysis.

However, educators, especially K-12 teachers and researchers, have not clearly identified how to teach it. In this study, a meta-review of the studies published in academic journals from 2006 to 2017 was conducted to analyze application courses, adopted learning strategies, participants, teaching tools, programming languages, and course categories of CT education. From the review results, it was found that the promotion of CT in education has made great progress in the last decade. In addition to the increasing number of CT studies in different countries, the subjects, research issues, and teaching tools have also become more diverse in recent years. It was also found that CT has mainly been applied to the activities of program design and computer science, while some studies are related to other subjects. Meanwhile, most of the studies adopted Project-Based Learning, Problem-Based Learning, Cooperative Learning, and Game-based Learning in the CT activities. In other words, such activities as aesthetic experience, design-based learning, and storytelling have been relatively less frequently adopted. Most of the studies focused on programming skills training and mathematical computing, while some adopted a cross-domain teaching mode to enable students to manage and analyze materials of various domains by computing. In addition, since the cognitive ability of students of different ages varies, the CT ability cultivation methods and content criteria should vary accordingly. Moreover, most studies reported the learners' CT performance and perspectives, while their information society ability was seldom trained. Accordingly, the research trends and potential research issues of CT are proposed as a reference for researchers, instructors, and policy makers.

However, many people still harbour concerns about them or oppose their use(4,5). In a nationally representative sample of US adults, we find that as extremity of opposition to and concern about genetically modified foods increases, objective knowledge about science and genetics decreases, but perceived understanding of genetically modified foods increases. Extreme opponents know the least, but think they know the most. Moreover, the relationship between self-assessed and objective knowledge shifts from positive to negative at high levels of opposition. Similar results were obtained in a parallel study with representative samples from the United States, France and Germany, and in a study testing attitudes about a medical application of genetic engineering technology (gene therapy). This pattern did not emerge, however, for attitudes and beliefs about climate change.

Comparing Diagnostic Performance and the Utility of Clinical Vignette-Based Assessment Under Testing Conditions Designed to Encourage Either Automatic or Analytic Thought	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article							EDUCATIONAL-STRATEGIES; EXAMINATION SCORES; MEDICAL EXPERTISE; PRIMARY-CARE; ERROR; ASSOCIATION; VALIDITY	Purpose Although decades of research have yielded considerable insight into physicians' clinical reasoning processes, assessing these processes remains challenging; thus, the authors sought to compare diagnostic performance and the utility of clinical vignette-based assessment under testing conditions designed to encourage either automatic or analytic thought. Method This 2011-2012 multicenter randomized study of 393 clinicians (medical students, postgraduate trainees, and faculty) measured diagnostic accuracy on clinical vignettes under two conditions: one encouraged participants to give their first impression (FI), and the other led participants through a directed search (DS) for the correct diagnosis. The authors compared accuracy, feasibility, reliability, and relation to United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) scores under each condition. Results A 2 (instructional condition) x 2 (vignette complexity) x 3 (experience level) analysis of variance revealed no difference in accuracy as a function of instructional condition (F[1,379] = 2.44, P = .12), but demonstrated the expected main effects of vignette complexity (F[1,379] = 965.2, P < .001) and experience (F[2,379] = 39.6, P < .001). Pearson correlations revealed greater associations between assessment scores and USMLE performance in the FI condition than in the DS condition (P < .001). Spearman-Brown calculations consistently indicated that alpha 0.75 could be achieved more efficiently under the FI condition relative to the DS condition. Conclusions Instructions to trust one's first impres-sions result in similar performance when compared with instructions to consider clinical information in a systematic fashion, but have greater utility when used for the purposes of assessment.

J	ComynWattiau, I; Akoka, J				ComynWattiau, I; Akoka, J			Logistics information system auditing using expert system technology	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd World Congress on Expert Systems	FEB 05-09, 1996	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA					This paper brings together two methodological strands of thinking, These are the managerial problem solving methodology of Logistics Information System auditing and the structured development of expert system technology. The investment being made in logistics in organizations is enormous and, although much effort has been devoted to creating structured methods to aid the development of information systems to support these organizations' logistics, the area of logistics Information System auditing remains less developed. The major aim of this paper is to provide a systemic approach of the application of expert system technology to Logistics Information System auditing, Taking a strategic view of Management Information System (MIS) in logistics, this paper describes the application of INFAUDITOR, an audit expert system, to logistics information systems auditing. INFAUDITOR has two fundamental features. First, it covers all domains of information systems, managerial (like logistics) as well as technical aspects. Secondly, it helps to determine, in a given audit situation, the respective importance that should be given to the different audit domains and tests of control. INFAUDITOR can be viewed as consisting of several expert systems as in blackboard systems. Its fact bases include the characteristics of the enterprise, its logistics information system and the audit objectives, Its rule bases encompass the audit criteria represented as a hierarchical tree. INFAUDITOR is used to assess the ability of a Logistics Information System (LIS) to provide decision makers with relevant, timely information for designing, planning and maintaining an efficient production system, for securing materials necessary for production, and for facilitating achievement of low operating and maintenance costs, We present and discuss results obtained by using INFAUDITOR in auditing the logistics Management Information System of a large European company.

Use of the informed health choices educational intervention to improve secondary students' ability to think critically about health interventions in Uganda: A cluster-randomized trial	JOURNAL OF EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						critical health literacy; critical thinking; randomized trial; secondary school; teaching and learning resources		Aim:The aim was to evaluate the effect of the Informed Health Choices (IHC) educational intervention on secondary students' ability to assess health-related claims and make informed choices.Methods:In a cluster-randomized trial, we randomized 80 secondary schools (students aged 13-17 years) in Uganda to the intervention or control (usual curriculum). The intervention included a 2-day teacher training workshop, 10 lessons accessed online by teachers and delivered in one school term. The lesson plans were developed for classrooms equipped with a blackboard or a blackboard and projector. The lessons addressed nine prioritized concepts. We used two multiple-choice questions for each concept to evaluate the students' ability to assess claims and make informed choices. The primary outcome was the proportion of students with a passing score (& GE;9 of 18 questions answered correctly).Results:Eighty schools consented and were randomly allocated. A total of 2477 students in the 40 intervention schools and 2376 students in the 40 control schools participated in this trial. In the intervention schools, 1364 (55%) of students that completed the test had a passing score compared with 586 (25%) of students in the control schools (adjusted difference 33%, 95% CI 26%-39%).Conclusions:The IHC secondary school intervention improved students' ability to think critically and make informed choices. Well-designed digital resources may improve access to educational material, even in schools without computers or other information and communication technology (ICT). This could facilitate scaling-up use of the resources and help to address inequities associated with limited ICT access.

We examined the processes supporting skilled performance in a complex film-based volleyball task using a representative simulated environment. Participants were presented a complex, game-like volleyball task. We combined eye movement recording with immediate retrospective verbal reports of thinking in fifteen elite female volleyball players, ranked into skilled and less skilled groups. Skilled players employed longer fixations than their less skilled counterparts, and spent a greater amount of time fixating the receiver and functional spaces between two or more players. Skilled participants generated significantly more condition concepts, and presented a superior level of sophistication in their verbal reports. Data suggests that it is relevant to use tasks that simulate real-life environments. The definition of functional spaces, aiming for locations that stimulate retrieving information from more than one cue at a time, affords researchers to use eye-tracking devices to analyze peripheral vision. Based on collection of verbal reports researchers could assess if those functional spaces were relevant for the subjects. Researchers need to be thoughtful when designing representative tasks in order to accurately simulate competitive contexts.

This paper takes a multidisciplinary view of BPR and focuses upon a number of the emergent issues. These include the role of strategy making, the promotion of communication and creativity, the role of statistics, and the effective use of performance measurement systems within a learning environment. The paper develops a framework that capitalises on the role of modelling in MS/OR as well as the various disciplines of the authors. As such, the framework draws on recent advances, as well as established thinking, in the areas of strategy development, information systems, quality management and statistical science, More importantly, the framework also provides an iterative approach to BPR enabling organisations to design, implement and monitor progress on an ongoing basis. Emphasis is placed on building effective communications, developing an organisational memory and supporting organisational learning.

A smart bench that invites passers-by to sit close. These and others are smart things, part of the Internet of Things (IoT) and people's lives. However, people are mainly IoT consumers and rarely given the possibility of becoming IoT creators. This paper presents a case study concerning the design of smart things for outdoor environments, with end users as the main creators. Ideas of smart things were collaboratively conceptualised by child end-users with a card-based board game. Their ideas were taken up in the form of inspiration cards within a bachelor's first-year course, by students coming from different high schools. Students started from children's ideas as inspiration triggers and collaboratively evolved some of them into interactive smart-thing prototypes. The paper concludes by reflecting on its results and drawing lessons for future editions of cross-generational workshops related to IoT design with end users.

An evaluation model for science curricula that analyses learning outcomes through five lenses	CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article							ORGANIC-CHEMISTRY; SYSTEMS THINKING; HIGHER-EDUCATION; STUDENTS; SKILLS; STRATEGIES; UNIVERSITY; LANGUAGE; ERRORS; TEACH	Science is rapidly changing with vast amounts of new information and technologies available. However, traditional instructional formats do not adequately prepare a diverse population of learners who need to evaluate and use knowledge, not simply memorize facts. Moreover, curricular change has been glacially slow. One starting goal for curricular change can be identifying the features of a current curriculum, including potential areas for improvement, but a model is needed to accomplish that goal. The vast majority of studies related to curricular change have been conducted in K-12 environments, with an increasing number in post-secondary environments. Herein, we describe a model for science curriculum evaluation that we designed by integrating a number of different approaches. That model evaluates the intended, enacted, and achieved components of the curriculum, anchored by analyzing learning outcomes through five lenses: (i) a scientificFrameworkreported by the US National Research Council, (ii) systems thinking, (iii) equity, diversity, and inclusion, (iv) professional skills, and (v) learning skills. No curriculum evaluation models to date have used the five learning outcomes lenses that we describe herein. As a proof of principle, we applied the evaluation model to one organic chemistry course, which revealed areas of strength and possible deficiencies. This model could be used to evaluate other science courses or programs. Possible deficiencies may be addressed in other courses, in the course at hand, or may not be deemed necessary or important to address, demonstrating the potential for this evaluation to generate areas for discussion and ultimately, improvements to post-secondary science education.

To address this circumstance, we have developed and implemented a geospatial curriculum approach to promote teachers' professional growth with curriculum-linked professional development (PD) to support the adoption of socio-environmental science investigations (SESI) in an urban school environment that includes reluctant learners. SESI focus on social issues related to environmental science. The pedagogy is inquiry-driven, with students engaged in map-based mobile data collection and subsequent analysis with Web-based dynamic mapping software to answer open-ended questions. Working with four science and social studies teachers, we designed and implemented a sequence of three locally oriented, geospatial inquiry projects that were implemented with 140 9th grade students. We investigated how the geospatial curriculum approach impacted the teachers' geospatial pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), their cartographic practices, and promoted geospatial thinking and analysis skills with their students. Findings revealed strong growth in teachers' geospatial PCK, increased map use by teachers, use of maps as media for inquiry and not didactic instruction, and modeling to guide students' geospatial analysis using GIS. Implications for PD to promote teachers' geospatial PCK and in-class cartographic practices are discussed.

Design: Pooled cross-sectional survey data. Setting: Health Information National Trends Survey. Participation: Data included 6 iterations of U.S. adults (Pooled: N = 19,496; 2007: N = 3,593; 2011: N = 3,959; 2013: N = 3,185; FDA 2015: N = 3,738; 2017: N = 3,285; and FDA 2017: N = 1,736). Measures: Outcome variables were health information seeking, high confidence, and high trust of health information from several sources. Independent variables were education and income group, controlling for other sociodemographic variables. Analysis: Weighted descriptive and multivariate logistic regression for the pooled sample assessed associations by education and income. Fully interacted models with education/income-survey year interactions compared differences in outcomes between years. Results: We found information seeking, confidence, and trust were associated with income and education, which supported previously reported findings. Additionally, our findings indicated low-and medium-income groups had significantly lower odds of seeking health information compared to those in a high-income group. Regarding trust of information, a high school education was associated with higher odds of trust in family and friends. We also found that, over time, information seeking, confidence, and trust behavior differed by income and education, with some differences persisting. Conclusion: Disparities by income and education in trust of information sources remained across time.

J	Xu, Y; Zhu, QX				Xu, Yuan; Zhu, Qunxiong			A NEW DESIGN METHOD FOR ENERGY SAVING AND CONSUMPTION REDUCING OF PROCESS INDUSTRY BASED ON EXTENSION THEORY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Extension theory; Scheme design; Energy saving and consumption reducing; PTA solvent system	AZEOTROPIC DISTILLATION	Energy saving and consumption reducing in process industry have recently become an urgent issue with common concern. Under the certainty of production device and technical condition, a reasonable and effective design scheme for operation conditions becomes the key part in reducing the consumption of energy and material. In actual production process, the operating variables are massive and the relation among them is complex, so that traditional design methods based on practice experience or case-based reasoning (CBR) technology have not met the demand. In the paper, a new intelligent design method based on extension theory is proposed, in which matter-element model is used to the deep design representation, rhombus thinking method is applied to the reasoning and analyzing in the design process including design transformation and design evaluation. Through the actual application in purified terephthalic acid (PTA) solvent system of a chemical plant, cases studies and comparison show that the proposed method uniformly presents the matter, formally describes the human thinking, and successfully provides the design scheme for operating conditions, which solves the contradiction between design goal and design conditions, gives the decision-making support for operation regulation, brings economic profit for enterprise, thus exploits a new and efficient way to the scheme design for enemy saving and consumption reducing in process industry.

S	Christian, P		Aversa, E; Manley, C		Christian, P			6-D, a process framework for the design & development of web-based systems	ASIST 2001: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 64TH ASIST ANNUAL MEETING, VOL 38, 2001	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASIST ANNUAL MEETING		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	64th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-Information-Science-and-Technology	NOV 03-08, 2001	WASHINGTON, D.C.	Amer Soc Informat Sci Technol				The 6-D framework is a process by which web-based design and development projects may be envisioned and structured, beginning with a design situation, and ending with an artifact. It was initially created as a result of a Job Task Analysis performed during 1998 in America and Europe by our team. The goal of the job task analysis was to understand exactly how web-based application design and development was being planned, what the inputs and outputs were for each phase of the process, and what the deliverables were for each phase. These meetings included representatives from academia, professional education, and practitioners. Further, it was our long-range goal to provide designers and developers a framework, or container, within which many methodologies and models could be employed. The results were carefully monitored and the result was a process framework agreed upon by all as a best-practices approach to web design and development. By the end of that analysis, we had a very clear understanding of how practitioners and academicians were thinking about and conducting the design and development of web-based applications. From this a process framework was created that included objectives, deliverables, and the roles involved for each phase. This process framework became known as 6-D, standing for the phases of web design and development. They are Discovery, Definition, Design, Development, Delivery, and (post) Delivery. This framework. is not offered as a methodology, but as a process container to hold any particular methodology or set of methodologies that an organization has adopted. There are several reasons for its importance and for its existence. Chief among them is the need for rigor and a more robust underlying program of structure and discipline that informs the design and development process. As we move into the 21st century our application needs are more complex than ever. And, that complexity demands a more thorough approach to web-based application development and delivery. Complicating this issue is the shortfall of skilled practitioners in the field. Web-based systems can be seen as representing a class of complex, artificial systems and, therefore, must be seen in context of a system, or, as Benathy suggests, "a configuration of parts connected by a web of relationships." In addition almost any framework that guides the design thinking of complex applications could benefit from a more systemic approach (Christian, 99). This paper will explore how the 6-D framework can form the core of a comprehensive systemic strategy and help provide a supporting structure for more robust design and development while allowing organizations to support whatever methods and models best suit their purpose. I will discuss the frameworks' application in the educational arena and in practice with particular attention to our experience incorporating various models into the framework. Further, I will review the framework in light of other work in methods, models, theories, and systemic thinking applied to web-based information systems.

In order to achieve the research goal, we conducted a qualitative study by observing 13 participants when they endeavored to make sense of three unfamiliar visualizations (i.e., a parallel-coordinates plot, a chord diagram, and a treemap) that they encountered for the first time. We collected data including audio/video record of think-aloud sessions and semi-structured interview; and analyzed the data using the grounded theory method. The primary result of this study is a grounded model of NOvice's information Visualization Sensemaking (NOVIS model), which consists of the five major cognitive activities: 1 encountering visualization, 2 constructing a frame. 3 exploring visualization, 4 questioning the frame. and 5 floundering on visualization. We introduce the NOVIS model by explaining the five activities with representative quotes from our participants. We also explore the dynamics in the model. Lastly, we compare with other existing models and share further research directions that arose from our observations.

J	Grinnell, F; Dalley, S; Reisch, J				Grinnell, Frederick; Dalley, Simon; Reisch, Joan			High school science fair: Experiences of two groups of undergraduate bioscience students	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GROUNDED THEORY; PARTICIPATION	Science fairs offer potential opportunities for students to learn first-hand about the practices of science. Over the past six years we have been carrying out voluntary and anonymous surveys with regional and national groups of high school and post high school students to learn about their high school science fair experiences regarding help received, obstacles encountered, and opinions about the value and impact of science fair. Understanding what students think about science fairs will help educators make science fairs more effective learning opportunities. In this paper, we focus on the findings with two national groups of post high school students-undergraduate research fellows (SURF students) who did research at UT Southwestern Medical Center during 2014-2019 and undergraduates biology students attending the 2019 Howard Hughes Medical Institute Science Education Alliance (SEA) summer symposium. About 25% of the students who completed surveys indicated that they had participated in high school science fair, but more than half attended high schools where science fairs were unavailable. Effectively, 6 out of every 10 students participated in science fair if available. Students who could have participated in high school science fair but chose not to do so identified not enough time and coming up with their project idea as major reasons why not. About half the SURF students favored requiring non-competitive science fair regardless whether they themselves had participated in science fair. On the other hand, less than 1 in 5 thought that competitive science fair should be required. Introduction to the scientific process and general learning were mentioned most frequently as the reasons to require non-competitive science fair; these reasons were mentioned rarely in connection with competitive science fair. Unlike the national cohort of high school students we surveyed previously, who mostly did science fair in 9(th) and 10(th) grades, SURF students participated in science fair throughout high school and were twice as likely as high school students to have carried out science fair more than once. In conclusion, our findings suggest that participation of the undergraduate bioscience majors in high school science fairs occurs far more frequently than recognized previously and provide insights into how these successful college students (gauged by the fact that they are doing summer science research) view science fairs. The findings emphasize further the importance of incentivizing rather than requiring science fair participation, especially in 9(th) and 10(th) grades, and the potential value of developing non-competitive science fairs.

J	KISHI, Y				KISHI, Y			A METHOD TOWARDS DESIGN INTELLIGENCE MODELING	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article								One purpose of design is said to think and make artificial things that have never existed in the world. It is, however, very difficult to make such an ideal software system currently. In this report, to answer problems such as -what kinds of design information to be treated -what operations to be adopted -how to derive numerical values and -how to certify the reality of results for the ideal system, a computing model is described from a total view of Design Intelligence, which means balanaced thought and practice in design. It has four sequencial parts, which are (1) idea-occurring to get ideas, (2) Knowledge-binding to modify knowledge, (3) Constraint-solving to get numerical values and (4) Conceptual-forming to certify shapes and their movement. Adding to this, a simple parallel approach is tested using an AND Parallel Prolog for concurrent communications among software modules.

Augmented Reality for Identifying Maintainability Concerns during Design	ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							BUILDING INFORMATION; IMPLEMENTATION; OPERATION; FRAMEWORK	In a building context, decisions made early in the design phase can have a major impact on maintainability of the resulting facility. Effectively leveraging the knowledge of facility management teams in the design stage can lead to improved maintainability in the operation phase, but this feedback can be challenging to elicit during the design stage because facility management teams may not be formed by the time of design. This requires designers, who may not have facility management experience, to think like facility managers in order to consider the needs of the maintenance teams. This paper examines the extent to which different visualization media may be able to enable individuals without prior maintenance experience to identify maintainability concerns in a design model. Student participants, without prior maintenance experience, were randomly assigned to explore a design to assess maintainability concerns with either augmented reality (AR) or a traditional computer screen for viewing a Building Information Model (BIM). Their perceptions, behaviors, and statements were recorded and analyzed. Results indicate that BIM supports better identification of potentially problematic areas, but AR allows users to more consistently determine why an area is problematic. This suggests an opportunity to use a hybrid BIM/AR approach for identifying and resolving maintainability considerations during the design phase. The findings from this work provide evidence to illustrate how AR and BIM may enable individuals with limited experience to be able to effectively think like facility managers in order to make better maintainability decisions during design to lead to a better building during operation.

J	Mittal, S; Shukla, D				Mittal, Shriyaa; Shukla, Diwakar			Maximizing Kinetic Information Gain of Markov State Models for Optimal Design of Spectroscopy Experiments	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B			English	Article							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; CONFORMATIONAL DYNAMICS; TRYPTOPHAN FLUORESCENCE; DISTANCE MEASUREMENTS; VARIATIONAL APPROACH; STRUCTURAL INSIGHTS; PROTEIN-STRUCTURE; SIMULATIONS; ACTIVATION; SEQUENCE	Spectroscopic techniques such as Trp-Tyr quenching, luminescence resonance energy transfer, and triplet-triplet energy transfer are widely used for understanding the dynamic behavior of proteins. These experiments measure the relaxation of a particular labeled set of residue pairs, and the choice of residue pairs requires careful thought. As a result, experimentalists must pick residue pairs from a large pool of possibilities. In the current work, we show that molecular simulation datasets of protein dynamics can be used to systematically select an optimal set of residue positions to place probes for conducting spectroscopic experiments. The method described in this work, called Optimal Probes, can be used to rank trial sets of residue pairs in terms of their ability to capture the conformational dynamics of the protein. Optimal probes ensures two conditions: residue pairs capture the slow dynamics of the protein and their dynamics is not correlated for maximum information gain to score each trial set. Eventually, the highest scored set can be used for biophysical experiments to study the kinetics of the protein. The scoring methodology is based on kinetic network models of protein dynamics and a variational principle for molecular kinetics to optimize the hyperparameters used for the model. We also discuss that the scoring strategy used by Optimal Probes is the best possible way to ensure the ideal choice of residue pairs for experiments. We predict the best experimental probe positions for proteins lambda-repressor, beta(2) adrenergic receptor, and villin headpiece domain. These proteins have been well-studied and allow for a rigorous comparison of Optimal Probes predictions with already available experiments. Additionally, we also illustrate that our method can be used to predict the best choice for experiments by including any previous experiment choices available from other studies on the same protein. We consistently find that the best choice cannot be based on intuition or structural information such as distance difference between few known stable structures of the protein. Therefore, we show that incorporating protein dynamics could be used to maximize the information gain from experiments.

These technologies are commonly assessed in terms of their effectiveness in modifying human behaviour. Nevertheless, the multifaceted social and psychological long-term consequences of these kinds of artifacts are often forgotten. To explore their design space, we involved 48 students asking them to envision and design future behaviour change systems. Following the recent interest in design fictions, which present 'fantasy prototypes' in plausible near futures, we investigated how designs might help people think of the presuppositions and implications of technology. Then, we analyzed four design fictions to explore themes that are often forgotten in the current behaviour change debate. We finally discussed the empirical and methodological outcomes of our study and presented a series of design considerations and research questions that could stimulate further reflections on behaviour change technologies and the method we employed.

Learning Bridge: Curricular Integration of Didactic and Experiential Education	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						student learning; introductory pharmacy practice experience; pharmaceutical sciences	PROFESSIONAL SOCIALIZATION; PHARMACY; DESIGN	Objectives. To assess the impact of a program to integrate introductory pharmacy practice experiences with pharmaceutical science topics by promoting active learning, self-directed learning skills, and critical-thinking skills. Design. The Learning Bridge, a curriculum program, was created to better integrate the material first-year (P1) students learned in pharmaceutical science courses into their introductory pharmacy practice experiences. Four Learning Bridge assignments required students to interact with their preceptors and answer questions relating to the pharmaceutical science material concurrently covered in their didactic courses. Assessment. Surveys of students and preceptors were conducted to measure the effectiveness of the Learning Bridge process. Feedback indicated the Learning Bridge promoted students' interaction with their preceptors as well as development of active learning, self-directed learning, and critical-thinking skills. Students also indicated that the Learning Bridge assignments increased their learning, knowledge of drug information, and comprehension of relevant data in package inserts. Conclusion. The Learning Bridge process integrated the didactic and experiential components of the curriculum, enhancing student learning in both areas, and offered students educational opportunities to interact more with their preceptors.

Are Opinions Based on Science: Modelling Social Response to Scientific Facts	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVOLUTION; PHYSICS; PERCEPTIONS; ATTITUDES	As scientists we like to think that modern societies and their members base their views, opinions and behaviour on scientific facts. This is not necessarily the case, even though we are all (over-) exposed to information flow through various channels of media, i.e. newspapers, television, radio, internet, and web. It is thought that this is mainly due to the conflicting information on the mass media and to the individual attitude (formed by cultural, educational and environmental factors), that is, one external factor and another personal factor. In this paper we will investigate the dynamical development of opinion in a small population of agents by means of a computational model of opinion formation in a co-evolving network of socially linked agents. The personal and external factors are taken into account by assigning an individual attitude parameter to each agent, and by subjecting all to an external but homogeneous field to simulate the effect of the media. We then adjust the field strength in the model by using actual data on scientific perception surveys carried out in two different populations, which allow us to compare two different societies. We interpret the model findings with the aid of simple mean field calculations. Our results suggest that scientifically sound concepts are more difficult to acquire than concepts not validated by science, since opposing individuals organize themselves in close communities that prevent opinion consensus.

While InfoVis has become a buzz topic in the digital humanities, skepticism remains about how effectively it integrates into and expands on traditional humanities research approaches. From an InfoVis perspective, we lack case studies that show the specific design challenges that make literary studies and humanities research at large a unique application area for information visualization. We examine these questions through our case study of the Speculative W@nderverse, a visualization tool that was designed to enable the analysis and exploration of an untapped literary collection consisting of thousands of science fiction short stories. We present the results of two empirical studies that involved general-interest readers and literary scholars who used the evolving visualization prototype as part of their research for over a year. Our findings suggest a design space for visualizing literary collections that is defined by (1) their academic and public relevance, (2) the tension between qualitative vs. quantitative methods of interpretation, (3) result- vs. process-driven approaches to InfoVis, and (4) the unique material and visual qualities of cultural collections. Through the Speculative W@nderverse we demonstrate how visualization can bridge these sometimes contradictory perspectives by cultivating curiosity and providing entry points into literary collections while, at the same time, supporting multiple aspects of humanities research processes.

Game-based Learning (GBL) is one of such aids that it can be successfully integrated to improve teaching and learning in diverse courses. In computer science courses, the concept of programming is found confusing and difficult to understand by students. This study is conducted to investigate and analyze the disposition of 5th grade primary school students on programming through a digital game-play. Sixty-three 5th grade primary school students, with little or no programming knowledge, performed various activities through a digital game framework. The study is based on a descriptive survey model and was carried out by using convergent mixed method design for data collection process. The data were collected through quantitative and qualitative approaches consecutively after the students were experimenting on the given digital game-based activity. The findings indicated that digital game-play helped the students to understand the concept of programming and it is observed that students have developed positive disposition towards programming through game-based activities even if they can have preconceptions.

This system was intended to solve problems caused by cognitive gaps between designer and reviewer in the design review process. Along with considering information technology, the most important issue for the system's development has been the logicalization of literal building codes. Therefore, to enhance the reliability and performance of the CCS, this study uses the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) on the basis of design thinking and communication theory to investigate the semantic difference and cognitive gaps among participants in the design review process and to propose the direction of system development. Our empirical results lead us to recommend grouping multi-stage screening and weighted assisted logicalization of non-quantitative building codes to improve the operability of CCS. Furthermore, CCS should integrate the Expert Evaluation System (EES) to evaluate the design value under qualitative building codes.

In developing organs, positional information can be idealized as a local coordinate system that arises from morphogen gradients controlled by organizers at key locations. This offers a plausible mechanism for the integration of the molecular networks operating in individual cells into the spatially coordinated multicellular responses necessary for the organization of emergent forms. Understanding how positional cues guide morphogenesis requires the quantification of gene expression and growth dynamics in the context of their underlying coordinate systems. Here, we present recent advances in the MorphoGraphX software (Barbier de Reuille et al., 2015?) that implement a generalized framework to annotate developing organs with local coordinate systems. These coordinate systems introduce an organ-centric spatial context to microscopy data, allowing gene expression and growth to be quantified and compared in the context of the positional information thought to control them.

Design A stratified cluster randomized controlled trial with data on 270 children collected longitudinally. Setting Fifteen school nurse-led community enuresis clinics in Leicestershire, UK. Main outcome measures The outcome measures were becoming and remaining dry and time to dry, non-attendance and dropout rates. The psychological measures completed by children were the impact of bedwetting and Coopersmith self-esteem scales. Parents completed the maternal tolerance scale. Results No significant intervention effect was found for any of the outcome measures recorded during treatment, at discharge or six-months post discharge. Conclusions Multimedia educational programs and written leaflets are widely used to enable children to learn more about their health-related conditions. However, our result suggests that multimedia is no more effective than traditional materials at effecting health-related behavioural change.

Rethinking the role and impact of health information technology: informatics as an interventional discipline	BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Biomedical research; Informatics; Research design	CLINICAL DECISION-SUPPORT; MEDICINE; SYSTEMS; RECORD; CARE	Recent advances in the adoption and use of health information technology (HIT) have had a dramatic impact on the practice of medicine. In many environments, this has led to the ability to achieve new efficiencies and levels of safety. In others, the impact has been less positive, and is associated with both: 1) workflow and user experience dissatisfaction; and 2) perceptions of missed opportunities relative to the use of computational tools to enable data-driven and precise clinical decision making. Simultaneously, the "pipeline" through which new diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents are being developed and brought to the point-of-care or population health is challenged in terms of both cost and timeliness. Given the confluence of these trends, it can be argued that now is the time to consider new ways in which HIT can be used to deliver health and wellness interventions comparable to traditional approaches (e.g., drugs, devices, diagnostics, and behavioral modifications). Doing so could serve to fulfill the promise of what has been recently promoted as "precision medicine" in a rapid and cost-effective manner. However, it will also require the health and life sciences community to embrace new modes of using HIT, wherein the use of technology becomes a primary intervention as opposed to enabler of more conventional approaches, a model that we refer to in this commentary as "interventional informatics". Such a paradigm requires attention to critical issues, including: 1) the nature of the relationships between HIT vendors and healthcare innovators; 2) the formation and function of multidisciplinary teams consisting of technologists, informaticians, and clinical or scientific subject matter experts; and 3) the optimal design and execution of clinical studies that focus on HIT as the intervention of interest. Ultimately, the goal of an "interventional informatics" approach can and should be to substantially improve human health and wellness through the use of data-driven interventions at the point of care of broader population levels. Achieving a vision of "interventional informatics" will requires us to re-think how we study HIT tools in order to generate the necessary evidence-base that can support and justify their use as a primary means of improving the human condition.

Based on the evaluation results of the diagnostic test, instructors may suggest or give students additional material on the subject area for students who do not meet the requirements. The S-P (Student-Problem) model has been used for this purpose for a long time. However, the current S-P model pays little attention to a student's response time for each test item or for the entire question set during the test. The student's response time for each test item can be an important factor for instructors wanting to diagnose each student's individual ability in problem solving. Also, there are few computerized diagnostic test analysis systems available that are designed to support both text-diagram-based and/or multimedia-based presentation test items. In this research, we incorporate the response time, difficulty index, and discriminatory index of each test item into an S-P model during the analysis. Specifically, we employ two terms: 1) the nimbleness of thinking of a student, which can be measured based on the response time for answering each test item, and 2) the problem solving ability of a student, which can be measured based on the student's ability to solve adaptive type questions with various difficulty levels and discrimination powers. With the incorporation of these parameters, an enhanced S-P model is presented. It can be used to diagnose both time dependent information and problem solving abilities with respect to test items and test-takers. A web-based computerized system was designed and implemented based on the enhanced S-P model for both text-diagram type presentation test items and multimedia type presentation test items. Practical examples were investigated and experimental studies conducted using the cognitive diagnostic computerized system to demonstrate the rationality and applicability of the proposed enhanced S-P model.

Product images, a vital aspect of the system interface, play a significant role in shaping users' first impressions, facilitating seller-buyer infor-mation interaction, and ultimately enhancing users' decisions making in the system. Across a series of studies, this research investigates the effect of cultural differences (thinking style: holistic vs. analytic) on image back-ground and reveals the underlying mechanism. Results show that online consumers from cultures characterized by holistic thinking style (Chinese sample) are more prone to purchase products presented with contextual backgrounds than those with white backgrounds, while this effect is absent for online consumers from cultures that tend to think in an analytic way (American sample). This effect is also observed when the thinking style is primed within the culture in separate samples from the United States and China. Study 3 employs eye-tracking technology and shows that holistic thinking, compared to analytic thinking, results in an asymmetry in cognitive effort to purchase the same products framed with contextual and white background images. Specifically, contextual (vs. white) background information greatly assists holistic thinking consumers in understanding the product, enabling them to spend less cognitive effort on product information processing. Instead, the cognitive effort that analytic thinking consumers spare in the product information is not affected by the background. Finally, we discuss theoretical contributions and practical insights for CBEC retailers and system designers that the findings indicate.

Their potential impact is particularly germane to the biology of pregnancy and perinatal medicine, where limited improvement in health outcomes for women and children has remained a global challenge. We assembled a group of experts to establish a Pregnancy Think Tank to discuss a broad spectrum of major gestational disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes that affect maternal-infant lifelong health and should serve as targets for leveraging the many recent advances. This report reflects avenues for future effects that hold great potential in 3 major areas: developmental genomics, including the application of methodologies designed to bridge genotypes, physiology, and diseases, addressing vexing questions in early human development; gestational physiology, from immune tolerance to growth and the timing of parturition; and personalized and population medicine, focusing on amalgamating health record data and deep phenotypes to create broad knowledge that can be integrated into healthcare systems and drive discovery to address pregnancy-related disease and promote general health. We propose a series of questions reflecting development, systems biology, diseases, clinical approaches and tools, and population health, and a call for scientific action. Clearly, transdisciplinary science must advance and accelerate to address adverse pregnancy outcomes. Disciplines not traditionally involved in the reproductive sciences, such as computer science, engineering, mathematics, and pharmacology, should be engaged at the study design phase to optimize the information gathered and to identify and further evaluate potentially actionable therapeutic targets. Information sources should include noninvasive personalized sensors and monitors, alongside instructive "liquid biopsies" for noninvasive pregnancy assessment. Future research should also address the diversity of human cohorts in terms of geography, racial and ethnic distributions, and social and health disparities. Modern technologies, for both data-gathering and data-analyzing, make this possible at a scale that was previously unachievable. Finally, the psychosocial and economic environment in which pregnancy takes place must be considered to promote the health and wellness of communities worldwide.

By using the heuristic thinking mode, people automatically process information that tends to be invariant across days, whereas by using the explicit thinking mode people explicitly process information that tends to be variant compared to typical previously learned information patterns. Previous studies on creativity found an association between creativity and the brain regions in the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the default mode network and the executive network. However, which neural networks contribute to the explicit mode of thinking during idea generation remains an open question. We employed an fMRI paradigm to examine which brain regions were activated when participants (n = 16) mentally generated alternative uses for everyday objects. Most previous creativity studies required participants to verbalize responses during idea generation, whereas in this study participants produced mental alternatives without verbalizing. This study found activation in the left anterior insula when contrasting idea generation and object identification. This finding suggests that the insula (part of the brain's salience network) plays a role in facilitating both the central executive and default mode networks to activate idea generation. We also investigated closely the effect of the serial order of idea being generated on brain responses: The amplitude of fMRI responses correlated positively with the serial order of idea being generated in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is part of the central executive network. Positive correlation with the serial order was also observed in the regions typically assigned to the default mode network: the precuneus/ cuneus, inferior parietal lobule and posterior cingulate cortex. These networks support the explicit mode of thinking and help the individual to convert conventional mental models to new ones. The serial order correlated negatively with the BOLD responses in the posterior presupplementarymotor area, left premotor cortex, right cerebellum and left inferior frontal gyrus. This finding might imply that idea generation without a verbal processing demand reflecting lack of need for new object identification in idea generation events. The results of the study are consistent with recent creativity studies, which emphasize that the creativity process involves working memory capacity to spontaneously shift between different kinds of thinking modes according to the context.

Digital storytelling for enhancing student academic achievement, critical thinking, and learning motivation: A year-long experimental study	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Improving classroom teaching; Learning communities; Media in education; Secondary education; Teaching/learning strategies	TECHNOLOGY; LEARNERS	The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of Digital storytelling (DST) on the academic achievement, critical thinking, and learning motivation of senior high school students learning English as a foreign language. The one-year study adopted a pretest and posttest quasi-experimental design involving 110 10th grade students in two English classes. The independent variable was information technology-integrated instruction (ITII) on two different levels - lecture-type ITII (comparison group) and DST (experimental group). Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected, including English achievement and critical thinking scores, questionnaire responses for learning motivation, as well as recordings of student and teacher interviews for evaluating the effectiveness of DST in learning. Descriptive analysis, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), and qualitative content analysis was used for evaluating the obtained data. Our findings indicate that DST participants performed significantly better than lecture-type ITII participants in terms of English achievement, critical thinking, and learning motivation.

Museum program design supports parent-child engineering talk during tinkering and reminiscing	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Parent-child relations; Museums; Communication; Learning; Memory; Narrative	SCIENCE; MEMORY; CONVERSATIONS; ENVIRONMENTS; KNOWLEDGE; BEHAVIOR; THINKING; STYLE	This study focused on tinkering, a playful form of open-ended problem solving that is being widely adopted in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education as a way of encouraging children's engagement in disciplinary practices of engineering. Nevertheless, the design of exhibits and programs and the nature of children's interactions with adults can determine whether and to what extent tinkering engenders participation in engineering practices such as testing and redesign. Researchers and museum practitioners worked together using design-based research methods to develop and test tinkering programs that could best support engineering learning. Two of the programs specified what families' engineering projects should do and provided exhibit spaces for testing and iterating the design (i.e., function-focused programs), and two programs did not. A total of 61 families with 6 to 8 year-old children (M-age = 7.07 years; 25 female) were observed during one of the programs and when reminiscing immediately after tinkering. Parent-child interaction patterns associated with understanding and remembering events-parent-child joint hands-on engagement and joint talk-and engineering design process talk were measured. All four programs were similar in terms of parent-child joint engagement. Compared with families who did not participate in function-focused programs, families who did talked more about the engineering design process during tinkering and when reminiscing. Parent-child engineering talk during tinkering mediated the association between the program design and engineering talk when reminiscing. Implications for research on children's learning and museum practice are discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Part I: Fitness for use	HERITAGE SCIENCE			English	Article						Heritage management; Conservation; Heritage values; Fitness for use; Psychometrics; Statistical experimental design (DOE)	DESIGN	Background: In heritage science literature and in preventive conservation practice, damage functions are used to model material behaviour and specifically damage (unacceptable change), as a result of the presence of a stressor over time. For such functions to be of use in the context of collection management, it is important to define a range of parameters, such as who the stakeholders are (e.g. the public, curators, researchers), the mode of use (e.g. display, storage, manual handling), the long-term planning horizon (i.e. when in the future it is deemed acceptable for an item to become damaged or unfit for use), and what the threshold of damage is, i.e. extent of physical change assessed as damage. Results: In this paper, we explore the threshold of fitness for use for archival and library paper documents used for display or reading in the context of access in reading rooms by the general public. Change is considered in the context of discolouration and mechanical deterioration such as tears and missing pieces: forms of physical deterioration that accumulate with time in libraries and archives. We also explore whether the threshold fitness for use is defined differently for objects perceived to be of different value, and for different modes of use. The data were collected in a series of fitness-for-use workshops carried out with readers/visitors in heritage institutions using principles of Design of Experiments. Conclusions: The results show that when no particular value is pre-assigned to an archival or library document, missing pieces influenced readers/visitors' subjective judgements of fitness-for-use to a greater extent than did discolouration and tears (which had little or no influence). This finding was most apparent in the display context in comparison to the reading room context. The finding also best applied when readers/visitors were not given a value scenario (in comparison to when they were asked to think about the document having personal or historic value). It can be estimated that, in general, items become unfit when text is evidently missing. However, if the visitor/reader is prompted to think of a document in terms of its historic value, then change in a document has little impact on fitness for use.

However, this view restricts the contribution of forensic science to one function and results in lost opportunities as investigative and intelligence roles are often overlooked. A change of perspective and expansion of the contributions of forensic science is required to take advantage of the benefits of abductive and inductive thought processes throughout the investigative and intelligence functions. One forensic discipline that has the potential to broaden its traditional focus is handwriting examination. Typically used in investigations that are focused on both criminal and civil cases, the examination procedure and outcome are time consuming and subjective, requiring a detailed study of the features of the handwriting in question. Traditionally, the major handwriting features exploited are characteristics that are often considered individual (or at least highly polymorphic) and habitual. However, handwriting can be considered as an information vector in an intelligence framework. One such example is the recognition of key elements related to the author's native language. This paper discusses the traditional method generally used around the world and proposes a theoretical approach to expand the application of handwriting examination towards gaining additional information for intelligence purposes. This concept will be designed and tested in a future research project. (C) 2017 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

New Graduate Nurses' Perceptions of the Effects of Clinical Simulation on Their Critical Thinking, Learning, and Confidence	JOURNAL OF CONTINUING EDUCATION IN NURSING			English	Article							NURSING-EDUCATION	Critical thinking has been a crucial outcome of nursing educational programs. Effective nurses should be knowledgeable about complex patient situations and confident in their skills. One teaching strategy recently adopted by some educators to develop nurses' critical thinking, learning, and confidence is simulation. Simulation incorporates scenarios and case studies developed to replicate real-life clinical situations. Learners are asked to solve clinical problems and make critical decisions based on the information provided. Little research has been done on how simulation experiences promote critical thinking, learning, and confidence, especially in new graduate nurses. This study explored the perceptions of new graduate nurses of how clinical simulation developed their critical thinking skills, learning, and confidence throughout their hospital clinical training. Ten new baccalaureate nursing graduates voluntarily participated in this study, which used an exploratory descriptive design. Data were collected by demographic questionnaires and semi-structured interviews and were analyzed using content analysis. Participants reported that simulation prepared them well to care confidently for critically ill patients. Simulation also helped them learn to make sound clinical decisions to improve patient outcomes. The findings have crucial implications for nursing education, practice, and research. They provide evidence to support the use of simulation as a teaching strategy to promote critical thinking skills, learning, and confidence. J Contin Educ Nurs 2010; 41(11): 506-516.

Design/methodology/approach - These purposes are achieved in an interdisciplinary way, in which the various scientific approaches are governed by a philosophical perspective that ensures the conceptual level and the unity of the discourse. The philosophical approach itself is practised in several specific fields and at various levels, being used in order to lay the foundations of a new domain of research. Specific theoretical problems are elucidated through concrete examples furnished by sciences and discussed from the perspective of inventics. Graphical representations help in giving a systemic and integrative perception of complex issues. Findings - The paper defines in a comprehensive way the two partially studied and till now separately conceived research fields; delimitates and characterizes a new domain of study, of crucial theoretical and practical interest; analyses some types of intellectual techniques involved in all sorts of inventive activity; identifies the main new ways of thinking encouraged by the information technologies and shows their forms and manifestations, as well as the new values promoted by their development. There are proposed some improvements on sociological thinking from the perspective of inventive thinking. The emergence of an invention ethics is anticipated as a necessary component of an invention culture. Originality/value - Proposes a new field of research, that of the intellectual invention, analyses the main instruments of its study and development, and uses the results of different sciences in order to lay the philosophical foundations of invention ethics as part of the future invention culture.

This paper discusses these aligned ideas in view of their value to translational design processes. The ideas embedded in these two approaches are considered in the light of critical questions associated with the development of health informatics. Health care processes for patients might be very fragmented. Synergy thinking is required in all areas of design: it is crucial to understand the theoretical frames and issues associated with focus environments, administration, and cost policy. By internalizing common nuances in these approaches, designers can ease the interaction and communication between experts from different backgrounds. Synergistic thinking aids designers in health informatics to produce more sophisticated products. Maturing in recognizing the whole aids to take into account "the very essentials" more easily. These skills are very vital in prioritizing development substances in health informatics area.

The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this line of research by showing CFOs' perceptions of Spanish companies with regard to their capital structure decisions. Design/Methodology The empirical approach is examined using information gathered through a survey answered by 140 CFOs of Spanish companies during 2011. Results are obtained from mean difference tests and ordered probit estimations. Findings The results of the paper show that managers attach importance to establishing and monitoring a target debt ratio and the capacity to maintain additional debt in order to provide financial flexibility. In addition, CFOs prefer internal financing to external, using debt when internal funds do not allow investments to be funded. Originality/Value On the whole, the results of this research show that trade-off and pecking order theories are not alternative views of the same problem, but represent complementary approaches of how companies define their capital structures.

J	Barford, L				Barford, Lee			Material Value Ethics in a Model Process for Values-Based Design	IEEE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY MAGAZINE			English	Article						Sociology; Transportation; Sensor systems and applications; Software; Safety; Information and communication technology; Industrial plants		Over recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that engineering activities must proceed with consideration of the human values that they potentially affect. The pervasiveness of communication and information technology (CIT) systems in nearly every aspect of work and personal life gives the system providers influence over human thought, feeling, and behavior with a magnitude not widely foreseen until a few years ago. Increasingly complex software, including applications of artificial intelligence that is poorly explainable, are integrated with the physical world through sensors, actuators, control systems, and Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled products. Such systems can pose direct threats to the physical safety of human beings and can negatively impact the environment. The design, deployment, and operation of transportation systems and chemical, nuclear, and other dangerous industrial plants have always required attention to human values such as safety in addition to economic values. However, recent events such as the Boeing 737 Max crashes and data breaches of financial information impacting broad swathes of nations' populations have brought public attention to the importance of including human values such as safety and privacy in the design, test, and deployment of CIT and hybrid software/control/actuation systems. This is especially the case for autonomous systems that can operate without-or can override-human decisions and control inputs [1].

However, path energy consumption-based UUV hull design requires a tremendous amount of calculation due to the frequent changes in relative velocity and attack angle between a UUV and ocean current. In order to address this issue, this work developed a data-driven design methodology for energy consumption-based UUV hull design using artificial intelligence-aided design (AIAD). The design methodology in this work combined a deep learning (DL) algorithm that predicts UUVs' resistance with different hull shapes under different velocities and attack angles with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for UUV hull design. We tested the proposed methodology in a path energy consumption-based experiment, where the optimized UUV hull showed an 8.8% reduction in path energy consumption compared with the initial UUV hull, and design costs were greatly reduced compared with the traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based methodology.

With the introduction of Computer Science (CS) into curricula worldwide, teachers' adoption of CS pedagogical content is essential to ensure the long-term success of reform initiatives. Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programs play a key role in this process. Unfortunately, adoption is seldom evaluated in CS-CPDs or CPDs in general. The result is a dearth of studies (i) modelling teachers' adoption of CS pedagogical content or (ii) investigating factors influencing the uptake of this new discipline. Both aspects are crucial to design and characterize successful CPD programs. Objectives. We thus propose the Teachers' Adoption of CS (TACS) model to investigate factors influencing the adoption of CS pedagogical content by teachers who are following a mandatory CS-CPD program. More specifically, the model proposes that contextual factors (e.g., age, gender, and general teaching experience), prior factors (e.g., experience, and CS perception), and acceptance factors (e.g., interest, and self-efficacy) may impact teachers' adoption of CS pedagogical content. Methods. The study included 180 grades 5 and 6 teachers (students aged 9-11) that were following a mandatory CS-CPD program. The CS-CPD program involved participation in three-day-long sessions distributed over the 2019-2020 academic year. In between sessions, with the support of instructional coaches in the schools, teachers were encouraged, but not required, to adopt the CS pedagogical content. Therefore, during the CPD, and employing surveys based on the TACS model, we evaluated teachers' adoption of the proposed content and investigated how the different factors influenced it. Results. At the PD-level, the results indicate that self-efficacy and interest queried during the CS-CPD are indicative of CS pedagogical content adoption. To shed more light on the relationshipbetween these metrics, a more in-depth analysis was conducted with n = 92 teachers whose responses could be matched between sessions. While interest relates to how teachers adopt CS pedagogical content overall, both interest and selfefficacy are necessary to ensure the likelihood of a specific activity being adopted. Finally, individual teacher characteristics appear to impact adoption, with teachers with low experience with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) requiring onboarding, while middle-aged teachers require convincing to adopt CS pedagogical content. Conclusion. Three takeaways emerge fromthe study. First, the analyses confirm the foundation of the TACS model. Second, the findings establish the key role that interest plays in said model. Finally, the results support the relationship between the contextual, prior and acceptance factors on the adoption of primary school CS pedagogical content.

Its success is dependent on the design team's ability to use present-day information to come up with concepts concerning future products. This paper takes as its task to investigate and explore what underlies this use of future-oriented information and what challenges it poses at the creative stages of a design process. The proposed solution is based on an analytic division of available information into (1) trends such as company strategies, trends in the society and working life that denote changing conditions, and (2) stable context features that describe issues that are unlikely to change in the timeframe concerned. A small case study is presented that exemplifies how this analytic distinction can be put into use. More broadly, the paper encourages designers to think reflectively about the nature of information on which design decisions are based.

Multiple-true-false questions reveal more thoroughly the complexity of student thinking than multiple-choice questions: a Bayesian item response model comparison	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION			English	Article						Assessment; Bayesian analysis; Item response theory; Mixed conceptions; Multiple-choice; Multiple-true-false; Question format; Undergraduate	KNOWLEDGE; VALIDATION; PARAMETERS; ABILITY	Background: Within undergraduate science courses, instructors often assess student thinking using closed-ended question formats, such as multiple-choice (MC) and multiple-true-false (MTF), where students provide answers with respect to predetermined response options. While MC and MTF questions both consist of a question stem followed by a series of options, MC questions require students to select just one answer, whereas MTF questions enable students to evaluate each option as either true or false. We employed an experimental design in which identical questions were posed to students in either format and used Bayesian item response modeling to understand how responses in each format compared to inferred student thinking regarding the different options. Results: Our data support a quantitative model in which students approach each question with varying degrees of comprehension, which we label as mastery, partial mastery, and informed reasoning, rather than uniform random guessing. MTF responses more closely estimate the proportion of students inferred to have complete mastery of all the answer options as well as more accurately identify students holding misconceptions. The depth of instructional information elicited by MTF questions is demonstrated by the ability of MTF results to predict the MC results, but not vice-versa. We further discuss how MTF responses can be processed and interpreted by instructors. Conclusions: This research supports the hypothesis that students approach MC and MTF questions with varying levels of understanding and demonstrates that the MTF format has a greater capacity to characterize student thinking regarding the various response options.

Teacher-centered classroom teaching cannot fully stimulate learning initiative and enthusiasm of students. Student-centered means that students actively learn and construct knowledge by participating in teaching activities. This study presents a student-centered online-offline hybrid teaching method, which adopts student-centered case-based teaching and online-offline case discussion in the postgraduate courses of computer science. The latest engineering cases are integrated into teaching and a case library is constructed. Taking the digital image processing course as an example, student-centered teaching allows students to choose what to learn and how to learn. Case-based teaching makes students better understand the application of theory of knowledge. It can introduce multiple perspectives, promote understanding and reflection on problems, and help students develop higher-level thinking, analysis, and synthesis skills. This study explores online-offline case discussion method in the student-centered teaching and proposes the principles of case design of postgraduate courses. Revised Bloom's taxonomy is used for teaching assessment. The actual teaching effect shows that student-centered case-based teaching and online-offline case discussion have achieved better teaching effect.

Traditional urban design methods focus on the form-making process and lack performance dimensions. Geodesign is an emerging approach that emphasizes the links between systems thinking, digital technology, and geographic context. This paper presents the research results of the first phase of a larger research collaboration and proposes an extended geodesign method for a district-scale urban design to integrate systems of renewable energy production, energy consumption, and storm water management, as well as a measurement of human experiences in cities. The method incorporates geographic information system (GIS), parametric modeling techniques, and multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) tools that enable collaborative design decision-making. The method is tested and refined in a test case with the objective of designing a near-zero-energy urban district. Our final method has three characteristics. 1) Integrated geodesign and parametric design: It uses a parametric design approach to generate focal-scale district prototypes by means of a custom procedural algorithm, and applies geodesign to evaluate the performances of design proposals. 2) A focus on design flow: It elaborates how to define problems, what information is selected, and what criteria are used in making design decisions. 3) Multi-objective optimization: The test case produces indicators from performance modeling and derives principles through a multi-objective computational experiment to inform how the design can be improved. This paper concludes with issues and next steps in modeling urban design and infrastructure systems based on MDO tools. (C) 2018 THE AUTHORS.

The RCDI was designed using a sequential mixed-methods protocol, such that the questions and distractors in the instrument were generated based on an analysis of qualitative semi-structured interviews in which general chemistry and organic chemistry students were asked to describe the concepts embedded in the surface features of RCDs and to use the mechanistic information encoded in RCDs. The RCDI was administered to second-semester general chemistry students (n = 443), second-semester organic chemistry students (n = 227), and second-semester physical/biophysical chemistry students (n = 45). Descriptive statistics and item function are presented for each of the three samples. Qualitative and quantitative evidence for the validity and reliability of the data generated by the RCDI are also presented. Major categories of misconceptions assessed by the RCDI and data demonstrating the prevalence of these misconceptions for all three groups of students are presented.

The study also explored the most difficult technical skills for the participants to perform. Background Assessment, communication and critical thinking are competencies that help in providing safe and appropriate care for patients. Yet, self-perceived competence was mostly measured while performance competence that reflected nurses' performance in real cases has seldom been explored in literature. Design A cross-sectional design was applied. The study adhered to the STROBE guidelines to improve reporting quality. Method Fifty-two nurses and 50 nursing students completed the Computerized Model of Performance-Based Measurement system, which measures performance competence including the steps of critical thinking, conflict resolutions and common clinical technical problems. Six case scenarios containing 107 test questions were completed. Results Only 53.85% of nurses and 20.0% of students achieved a satisfactory level of performance competence. They showed low scores on the steps of critical thinking: "collecting data from on-site physical assessment," "processing information," "recognising/prioritising problems" and "arranging a course of action for patient care," as well as solving common technical problems and conflicts. The three most difficult skills to perform were CPR, reading EKGs and venipuncture/starting intravenous lines. Conclusions The study captured the participants' weaknesses in the critical thinking process and the nursing skills that were difficult to perform. These skills are imperative to nursing care and need to be strengthened in school and in-service education. The academic curriculum and course design for students as well as training programmes for nurses need to be reviewed to address the challenges to be faced in a clinical setting. Relevance to clinical practice Teaching-learning strategies that focus on enhancing critical thinking and performing difficult skills need to be designed and implemented both in practice and in school.

We developed an app to support asthma self-management among people with limited health literacy in a web-based workshop (to ensure physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic). Objective: The aim of this study is to develop and test a prototype asthma self-management mobile app tailored to the needs of people with limited health literacy through a web-based workshop. Methods: We recruited participants from a primary care center in Malaysia. We adapted a design sprint methodology to a web-based workshop in five stages over 1 week. Patients with asthma and limited health literacy provided insights into real-life self-management issues in stage 1, which informed mobile app development in stages 2-4. We recruited additional patients to test the prototype in stage 5 using a qualitative research design. Participants gave feedback through a concurrent thinking-aloud process moderated by a researcher. Each interview lasted approximately 1 hour. Screen recordings of app browsing activities were performed. Interviews were audio-recorded and analyzed using a thematic approach to identify utility and usability issues. Results: The stakeholder discussion identified four themes: individual, family, friends, and society and system levels. Five patients tested the prototype. Participants described 4 ways in which the app influenced or supported self-management (utility): offering information, providing access to an asthma action plan, motivating control of asthma through support for medication adherence, and supporting behavior change through a reward system. Specific usability issues addressed navigation, comprehension, and layout. Conclusions: This study proved that it was possible to adapt the design sprint workshop to a web-based format with the added advantage that it allowed the development and the testing process to be done efficiently through various programs.

A variant of the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) designed specifically to elicit deficits in the processing of contextual information has been administered to 20 schizophrenic patients and 20 healthy controls. The relation to Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), relatively specific to prefrontal damage and executive dysfunctioning, and clinical status by using scales for the assessment of positive, negative symptoms and outcome has been investigated. The data show that multi-episode schizophrenic patients manifest inability to use contextual information to inhibit habitual response to an ambiguous stimulus and to maintain information across delay, without a general attention deficit. We also found a relationship between contextual reasoning and WCST unique errors, hallucinations, formal thought disorders, and outcome evaluation. Our results further support the hypothesis that the deficit of contextual reasoning could account for cognitive impairments and symptoms of patients with schizophrenia. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

It gave an opportunity to display best in class outcomes and engage in world class networking in a less rigid environment than a scientific conference. A number of formats were adopted in the Festival, from traditional impulse talks to innovative interactive sessions, and the thought-provoking discussions allowed the participants to share their experiences and knowledge around the advantages and challenges that Climate Services face within different sectors. Three Climateurope Festivals were originally planned to be held across Europe. Two Festivals were successfully organised, the first in Valencia in 2017, and the second in Belgrade in 2018. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns and travel restrictions, the third and final Festival was held online as a series of virtual web-based Festivals in 2020/2021. The Festivals were highly valued by participants. There was a strong desire by the Climateurope network to continue a science-stakeholder dialogue and make the Climateurope Festivals a regular event.

Combining multivariate statistics and the think-aloud protocol to assess Human-Computer Interaction barriers in symptom checkers	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Human Computer Interaction; Usability testing; Clinical Decision Support Systems; Symptom checkers	TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL; HEALTH INFORMATION; PERCEIVED EASE; USABILITY; DIAGNOSIS; RECORD	Symptom checkers are software tools that allow users to submit a set of symptoms and receive advice related to them in the form of a diagnosis list, health information or triage. The heterogeneity of their potential users and the number of different components in their user interfaces can make testing with end-users unaffordable. We designed and executed a two-phase method to test the respiratory diseases module of the symptom checker Erdusyk. Phase I consisted of an online test with a large sample of users (n = 53). In Phase I, users evaluated the system remotely and completed a questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model. Principal Component Analysis was used to correlate each section of the interface with the questionnaire responses, thus identifying which areas of the user interface presented significant contributions to the technology acceptance. In the second phase, the think-aloud procedure was executed with a small number of samples (n = 15), focusing on the areas with significant contributions to analyze the reasons for such contributions. Our method was used effectively to optimize the testing of symptom checker user interfaces. The method allowed kept the cost of testing at reasonable levels by restricting the use of the think-aloud procedure while still assuring a high amount of coverage. The main barriers detected in Erdusyk were related to problems understanding time repetition patterns, the selection of levels in scales to record intensities, navigation, the quantification of some symptom attributes, and the characteristics of the symptoms.

J	Taylor, P; Black, AW; Caley, R				Taylor, P; Black, AW; Caley, R			Heterogeneous relation graphs as a formalism for representing linguistic information	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article								Heterogeneous relation graphs (HRGs) can be used to represent arbitrary linguistic information. Originally designed for use in speech synthesis, HRGs can be used for speech annotation purposes also. In the HRG formalism, atomic linguistic entities such as words, syllables and phones are represented by attribute value matrices known as linguistic items. Using attribute value matrices for items allows them to contain any type or amount of linguistic information. Items are organised into linguistic relations, which take the form of lists, trees or other structures. Items can belong to more than one relation, which allows words to appear in the word relation and, say, the syntax relation. The ability to have items in multiple relations, along with a function ability which can calculate certain values on the fly, eliminates much of the redundancy present in simpler systems. The HRG formalism is not tied to any particular linguistic theory, nor does it impose any preset ideas about what sort of format syntax, prosody or phonology information should have. This paper explains the KRG formalism in detail, and shows why we think this is superior to the types of "multi-level" formats normally used in speech synthesis and database annotation.

J	Wang, JG				Wang, Jianguo			Development trend of urban design in "digital age": Pan-dimensionality and individual-ubiquity	FRONTIERS OF STRUCTURAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Review						digital age; urban design; multiple objectives; human-computer interaction; pan-dimensionality; individual-ubiquity	PERSPECTIVE; FUTURE; CITIES	The wave of "digital age" featuring digital information is coming. Digital technology is profoundly changing the societal development direction and evolution paths. It also has significant bearing on production modes, social interactions and lifestyles. With regard to urban design, a system of knowledge about the creation and adaptation of material space forms that integrate humanities, art, technology and materials, digital technology has provided it with a brand-new and revolutionary scientific impetus for its evolution. The result of this evolution is "digital urban design paradigm based on human-computer interaction", i.e., the urban development is moving toward "pan-dimensionality" and "individual ubiquity". The future of urban design will construct a new approach to urban research and engineering, which is more complex, capable of accommodating and compatible with multiple goals of "instrumental rationality" and "value rationality". Such a new approach shall be led by the probabilistic theory of "gray scale thinking", reflecting quaternary synergetic view of "scientific rationality, ecological rationality, cultural rationality and technical rationality" to realize the cognitive progress of "engineering for the benefit of mankind".

Criteria for development, content and design have been defined in a corresponding guideline. However, no instruments exist that provide reasonably operationalised measurement items. Therefore, we drafted the checklist, MAPPinfo, addressing the existing criteria with 19 items.ObjectivesThe current study aimed to validate MAPPinfo.MethodsFive substudies were conducted subsequently at the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Germany and the Medical University of Graz, Austria: (1) to determine content validity through expert reviews of the first draft, (2) to determine feasibility using 'think aloud' in piloting with untrained users, (3) to determine inter-rater reliability and criterion validity through a pretest on 50 health information materials, (4) to determine construct validity using 50 developers' self-declarations about development methods as a reference standard, (5) to determine divergent validity in comparison with the Ensuring Quality Information for Patients (EQIP) (expanded) Scale. The analyses used were qualitative methods and correlation-based methods for determining both inter-rater reliability and validity.ResultsThe instrument was considered by experts to operationalise the existing guidelines convincingly. Health and nursing science students found it easy to understand and use. It also had good interrater reliability (mean of T coefficients = .79) and provided a very good estimate of the reference standard (Spearman's rho = .89), implying sound construct validity. Finally, comparison with the EQIP instrument revealed important and distinct areas of similarities and differences.ConclusionsThe new instrument is ready for use as a screening instrument without the need for training. According to its underpinning concept the instrument exclusively comprises items which are justified by either ethics or research evidence, implying negligence of not yet evidence based, however, potentially important criteria. Further research is needed to complete the body of evidence-based criteria, aiming at an extension of the guideline and MAPPinfo.Trial registration numberAsPredicted22546; date of registration: 24 July 2019.

Methods: This study took a mixed-methods approach utilising a quantitative-qualitative design. Quantitative analysis regarding the values placed by the students on 22 aspects of health-related information and qualitative analysis of their health priorities drew on findings from a semi-structured researcher-generated questionnaire, administered pre-, post-and 15-week post-post-intervention. Setting: The setting was a higher education institution in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Participants were 34 first-year consumer science students, who engaged in a year-long, salutogenic wellness programme. Results: Findings revealed an increase in the participants' value of health information for a number of wellness variables.

Lecturers in the social sciences reported a well-established practice of information and communication technologies (ICTs) use for general purposes (although frequent use tended to be for email and searching the Internet). They had a high self-efficacy in terms of using ICTs both generally and for teaching and learning, and a high enthusiasm for the use of ICTs for teaching and learning. Half the lecturers had started using ICTs recently with the introduction of learning management systems (LMSs) whereas the other half had established practices that preceded the main-streaming of LMSs across universities. Only about a quarter of the respondents felt able to develop and update ICTs themselves which indicates that support is a necessary part of teaching with technology. in terms of different types of use the focus was on putting content on the web and course administration. Use of ICTs for teaching of skills (whether information literacy, problem solving or critical thinking) was infrequent. There were different types of ICT use across the different sub-disciplines. Lecturers reported factors which constrained their use of ICTs for teaching and learning, such as inadequate technology, pedagogical issues (e.g. plagiarism), and students opting out of lectures when materials were available online. It is argued that user studies in are relevant to the future delivery of educational material, in terms of removing barriers to use and targeting training and supportive activities.

Skills and capabilities for a sustainable and circular economy: The changing role of design	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Circular economy; Closed loop systems; Design for lifecycle; Sustainable strategy; Sustainable product-service system (SPSS)	PRODUCT-SERVICE SYSTEMS; LOOP SUPPLY CHAINS; CONSUMPTION; FRAMEWORK	Implementing practices for a circular economy transforms the way companies do business, notably in the manufacturing industry. However, a circular economy requires a transformation of both production and consumption systems; the standard approach for creation, fabrication, and commerce of products is challenged. Authors repeatedly call for the development of new proficiencies to attend to system transformations, but these so far have not been described for design and engineering. Given that the design of a product directly influences the way a value chain will be managed, building circular, globally sustainable value chains inevitably signifies a fundamental change in the practice of design. Comprehensive analyses were conducted on case studies from a variety of multinational enterprises that are transforming their product strategies for climate change. Changes in design processes were identified, revealing a growing necessity for industry to employ new proficiencies that support closure of material loops. This paper contributes to existing literature by depicting successful practices being implemented in industry. A variety of new capabilities are key to design for a sustainable future; these range from deeper knowledge of material composition to rich understanding of social behaviour. Resulting from this research, learning goals are proposed to serve as guidance for manufacturing companies seeking to tackle climate change. Conclusions aim to encourage researchers and academics to respond to emerging needs by re-thinking education in design and engineering. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper traces the roots of these symptoms back to causes of information entropy and structural holes, invisible private and undiscoverable public knowledge which characterize the sad state of our current knowledge management and creation practices. As part of an ongoing design science research and prototyping project, the article's (neg)entropic perspectives complement a succession of prior multi-disciplinary publications. Looking forward, it proposes a novel decentralized generative knowledge management approach that prioritizes the capacity development of autonomous individual knowledge workers not at the expense of traditional organizational knowledge management systems but as a viable means to foster their fruitful co-evolution. The article, thus, informs relevant stakeholders about the current unsustainable status quo inhibiting knowledge workers; it presents viable remedial options (as a prerequisite for creating the respective future generative Knowledge Management (KM) reality) to afford a sustainable solution with the generative potential to evolve into a prospective general-purpose technology.

Experimental Evidence against Asymmetric Motivations to Believe False Political Information	JOURNAL OF POLITICS			English	Article						rigidity of the right; ideology; motivated reasoning; conspiracy beliefs	SCIENCE	Recent political events have galvanized interest in the promulgation of misinformation-particularly false rumors about political opponents. An array of studies provide reasons to think that harboring false political beliefs is a disproportionately conservative phenomenon, since citizens with affinity for the political right endorse more false information than people with affinity for the left. However, as we discuss below, past research is limited in its ability to distinguish supply-side explanations for this result (false information is spread more effectively by elites on the right) from demand-side explanations (citizens who sympathize with the right are more likely to believe false information upon receipt). We conduct an experiment on a representative sample of Americans designed specifically to reveal asymmetries in citizens' proclivity to endorse false damaging information about political opponents. In a contrast with previous results, we find no evidence that citizens on the political right are especially likely to endorse false political information.

J	Sun, Y; Kantor, PB				Sun, Y; Kantor, PB			Cross-evaluation: A new model for information system evaluation	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SEEKING; RELEVANCE; USERS	In this article, we introduce a new information system evaluation method and report on its application to a collaborative information seeking system, AntWorld. The key innovation of the new method is to use precisely the same group of users who work with the system as judges, a system we call Cross-Evaluation. In the new method, we also propose to assess the system at the level of task completion. The obvious potential limitation of this method is that individuals may be inclined to think more highly of the materials that they themselves have found and are almost certain to think more highly of their own work product than they do of the products built by others. The keys to neutralizing this problem are careful design and a corresponding analytical model based on analysis of variance. We model the several measures of task completion with a linear model of five effects, describing the users who interact with the system, the system used to finish the task, the task itself, the behavior of individuals as judges, and the self-judgment bias. Our analytical method successfully isolates the effect of each variable. This approach provides a successful model to make concrete the "three-realities" paradigm, which calls for "real tasks," "real users," and "real systems.".

However, their applications in some specific fields, such as chem-/biosensing remain hampered due to their inherent instability to different external stimuli. Herein, we discover a novel mechanism that ethanol, a chemical that is generally thought to be detrimental to PNCs, could specifically initiate the in-situ crystallization of the precursor salts absorbed by paper fiber to yield standard CsPbBr3 fluorescent PNCs. Based on systematical experimental verification, it is revealed that ethanol could mediate the interfacial inter-action of the PNC precursor salts on the paper fiber to allow for this exceptional in-situ PNC crystallization process. Accordingly, a fluorescence turn-on mode paper sensor for rapid and high-sensitive expiratory alcohol detection is designed, which could fulfill the on-site visualized drink-driving screening requirement. Further-more, the application of this new mechanism in multidimensional information encryption is also demonstrated. This work not only discovers a new mechanism for PNC crystallization but also expands the sensing application toolbox of PNCs.

The paper presents an operational definition of ICT skills, an instrument measuring these skills as well as the students' results in the test. The definition of ICT skills used considers Chile's curricular framework, functional and cognitive skills. Specifically, ICT skills were defined as the capacity to solve problems of information, communication and knowledge in digital environments. A performance-based assessment was designed in a virtual environment to measure these skills. The analysis of the results showed that the majority of students were able to solve tasks related to the use of information as consumers, i.e., approximately three quarters of the students were able to search for information and half of them were also able to organize and manage digital information. Additionally, they show that very few students were able to succeed in tasks related to the use of information as producers, i.e., only one third of the students were able to develop their own ideas in a digital environment and less than one fifth were able to refine digital information and create a representation in a digital environment. Socioeconomic group, access, daily use and confidence in doing ICT-related activities were all positively associated with higher scores, showing the need to implement strategies to compensate this inequality, possibly by explicitly defining these aims in the national curriculum.

While prior work has identified the existence of this ownership bias in design professionals, limited work has investigated how the characteristics of the idea set affects this bias. In other words, is a preference for one's own ideas a bad thing if the ideas are truly better? This paper seeks to fill this research void through two design thinking workshops conducted with 45 design professionals recruited from two engineering companies. During the study, the participants individually generated and selected ideas as part of a 2-h team design challenge. The ideas generated were then rated for: (1) their perceived future value by the design team and (2) their creativity by expert raters. The results suggest that design professionals only exhibited ownership bias for ideas that were assessed to have little to no future value in the design process (low in idea goodness). In addition, professionals showed preferences for self-generated ideas that were of high usefulness and elegance but low in creativity, indicating an impact of creativity on ownership bias. These findings provide new evidence on the negative effects of ownership bias on the design process.

J	Tang, Q; Luo, YW; Wu, XD				Tang, Qian; Luo, Ying-Wen; Wu, Xiao-Di			Research on the evaluation method of agricultural intelligent robot design solutions	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VIKOR	BackgroundAt present, agricultural robots are produced in large quantities and used in agricultural planting, and the traditional agricultural model is gradually shifting to rely on the Internet of Things and sensors to accurately detect crop growth information. The scientific and rational design of agricultural robots plays a huge role in planting and production efficiency, however, the factors affecting their design are complex and ambiguous, so it is necessary to use a rational evaluation system to make a preferential decision among multiple design options. PurposesIn order to reduce the subjectivity and blindness of program selection in the process of agricultural robot design, make the decision more objective and reasonable, and thus enhance the practicality and scientificity of the program, a new comprehensive evaluation method based on user requirements is proposed. MethodsFirst, after researching and interviewing users and farming operations, obtaining raw information on requirements, using the Kano model to classify the requirements and establishing an evaluation index system. Secondly, the combination of hierarchical analysis(AHP) and entropy weighting method is used to assign weights to the evaluation index system, calculate the weight value and importance ranking of each index, and carry out various program designs based on the ranking. Finally, the VIKOR method was applied to evaluate and rank the design solutions. ResultsThe new evaluation method can better complete the preferential decision of the agricultural robot design scheme and get a more perfect design scheme, which reduces the influence of human subjective thinking in the decision-making process. ConclusionsThe method not only corrects the traditional evaluation method, but also effectively improves the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the design evaluation process. It also provides a reference for designers to preferably select design solutions and promotes the development of small mobile machines in the context of smart agriculture.

J	Hong, YJ; Choi, B; Lee, K				Hong, You Jeong; Choi, Beomjoon; Lee, Kyogu			When background music in audiovisual advertisements can boost the perceived competence of the advertised brands - an empirical study from South Korea	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS			English	Article; Early Access						Advertising; Brand competence; Background music; Consumer perception; Thinking styles	PERCEPTION; CONSUMERS; PITCH; PERSONALITY; THINKING; WARMTH; TRUST; FREQUENCY; SALIENCE; MEANINGS	PurposeThe authors aim to explore whether and how variations on pitch levels of background music in audiovisual commercials affect consumers' judgments of the competence of the advertised brands and for which group of consumers such changes in ad backgrounds are more influential.Design/methodology/approachConsumers are presented with an audiovisual advertisement in which the pitch of background music is lowered or raised. They are subsequently asked to evaluate the music and traits of the advertised brand and indicate their predisposed styles of thinking.FindingsConsumers tend to judge a brand in an audiovisual commercial as possessing a higher level of competence traits when the brand is accompanied by lower-pitched (vs higher-pitched) background music, which is mediated by levels of powerfulness they perceive from the background music. Consumers with holistic (vs analytic) thinking styles, who are known to devote more focused attention to background information, tend to be more (vs less) susceptible to the changes in pitch.Research limitations/implicationsThe current research approaches thinking styles as predisposed individual differences as in prior works in marketing. Provided that the predisposed thinking styles can be influenced by individuals' cultural backgrounds, the authors suggest cross-cultural studies as an approach to further validate the present findings.Practical implicationsGiven the recent trends that consumers are increasingly exposed to audiovisual ads with the rapid growth of various video-based platforms (e.g. YouTube) and mobile advertising, this empirical study may assist contemporary marketers in considering an acoustic strategy for brand communication using the audiovisual advertisement. This study suggests that the pitch of ad background music can serve as a manageable strategic tool that can assist in establishing an image of a competent brand.Originality/valueThis research highlights a seemingly-trivial element in audiovisual advertisements, the pitch of background music, as a crucial determinant of the perceived competence of an advertised brand upon which further brand evaluations (e.g. brand trust, purchase intention) are based. An important yet overlooked effect of ad recipients' predisposed thinking styles on how consumers respond to the changes of background cues in audiovisual commercials is also proposed.

This paper seeks to illustrate the advantages of combining usability testing with 'theoretical modelling', i.e. analyses that relate the findings of qualitative studies during intervention development to social science theory, in order to gain deeper insights into the reasons and context for how people respond to the intervention. This paper illustrates how usability testing may be enriched by theoretical modelling by means of two qualitative studies of users' views of the delivery of information in an internet-delivered intervention to help users decide whether they needed to seek medical care for their cold or flu symptoms. Methods: In Study 1, 21 participants recruited from a city in southern England were asked to 'think aloud' while viewing draft web-pages presented in paper format. In Study 2, views of our prototype website were elicited, again using think aloud methods, in a sample of 26 participants purposively sampled for diversity in education levels. Both data-sets were analysed by thematic analysis. Results: Study 1 revealed that although the information provided by the draft web-pages had many of the intended empowering benefits, users often felt overwhelmed by the quantity of information. Relating these findings to theory and research on factors influencing preferences for information-seeking we hypothesised that to meet the needs of different users (especially those with lower literacy levels) our website should be designed to provide only essential personalised advice, but with options to access further information. Study 2 showed that our website design did prove accessible to users with different literacy levels. However, some users seemed to want still greater control over how information was accessed. Conclusions: Educational level need not be an insuperable barrier to appreciating web-based access to detailed health-related information, provided that users feel they can quickly gain access to the specific information they seek.

Hence, the purpose of this study was to document learners' epistemic criteria and strategies for evaluating scientific visual representations (VRs). Junior high-school students evaluated four pairs of VRs that included different representations of the same phenomenon, justified their judgements, and described their criteria and strategies for evaluating good scientific VRs. Learners described and applied criteria related to the representation of the referent, to communicative quality, and to affordances for achieving epistemic aims, such as understanding. Learners applied criteria adaptively: Design contrasts between VRs evoked greater use of communicative and epistemic aim affordance criteria, whereas informational contrasts evoked greater use of representational criteria. Learners described a range of VR evaluation strategies. However, only a minority mentioned information validity and source trustworthiness evaluation strategies. Implications regarding learners' epistemic competence for evaluating VRs are discussed.

Effectiveness of clinician-selected electronic information resources for answering primary care physicians' information needs	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							DECISION-SUPPORT; ONLINE EVIDENCE; KNOWLEDGE; OUTCOMES; MEDLINE; SYSTEMS; IMPACT; ERROR	Objective: To determine if clinician-selected electronic information resources improve primary care physicians' abilities to answer simulated clinical questions. Design: Observational study using hour-long interviews in physician offices and think-aloud protocols. Participants answered 23 multiple-choice questions and chose 2 to obtain further information using their own information resources. We established which resources physicians chose, processes used, and results obtained when looking for information to support their answers. Measurements: Correctness of answers before and after searching, resources used, and searching techniques. Results: 23 physicians sought answers to 46 questions using their own information resources. They spent a mean of 13.0 (SD 5.5) minutes searching for information for the two questions using an average of 1.8 resources per question and a wide variety of searching techniques. On average 43.5% of the answers to the original 23 questions were correct. For the questions that were searched, 18 (39.1%) of the 46 answers were correct before searching. After searching, the number of correct answers was 19 (42.1%). This difference of I correct answer was attributed to 6 questions (13.0%) going from an incorrect to correct answer and 5 (10.9%) questions going from a correct to incorrect answer. We found differences in the ability of various resources to provide correct answers. Conclusion: For the primary care physicians studied, electronic information resources of choice did not always provide support for finding correct answers to simulated clinical questions and in some instances, individual resources may have contributed to an initially correct answer becoming incorrect.

It is caused by abnormal expansion of a CAG triplet in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein (Htt), with consequent expansion of a polyglutamine repeat in mutated Htt (mHtt). This makes mHtt highly unstable and aggregation prone. Soluble mHtt is linked to cytotoxicity and neurotoxicity, whereas mHtt aggregates are thought to be neuroprotective. While Htt and mHtt are ubiquitously expressed throughout the brain and peripheral tissues, HD is characterized by selective degradation of the corpus striatum, without notable alterations in peripheral tissues. Screening for mRNAs preferentially expressed in rodent striatum led to the discovery of a GTP binding protein homologous to Ras family members. Due to these features, the newly discovered protein was termed Ras Homolog Enriched in Striatum (RHES). The aetiological role of RHES in HD has been ascribed to its small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-E3 ligase function. RHES sumoylates mHtt with higher efficiency than wild-type Htt, thereby protecting mHtt from degradation and increasing the amounts of the soluble form. Although RHES is an attractive target for HD treatment, essential information about protein structure and function are still missing. With the aim of investigating RHES 3D structure and function, bioinformatic analyses and molecular modelling have been performed in the present study, based on which, RHES regions predicted to be involved in the interaction with mHtt or the SUMO-E2 ligase Ubc9 have been identified. These regions have been used to design peptides aimed at inhibiting RHES interactions and, therefore, mHtt sumoylation; in turn, these peptides will be used to develop small molecule inhibitors by both rational design and virtual screening of large compound libraries. Once identified, RHES sumoylation inhibitors may open the road to the development of therapeutic agents against the severe, and currently untreatable, HD.

J	Hayata, T; Hidaka, Y; Kikuchi, Y				Hayata, Tomoya; Hidaka, Yoshimasa; Kikuchi, Yuta			Diagnosis of information scrambling from Hamiltonian evolution under decoherence	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							QUANTUM; COLLISIONS	We apply a quantum teleportation protocol based on the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment to quantify how scrambling a given quantum evolution is. It has an advantage over the direct measurement of out-of-time ordered correlators when used to diagnose the information scrambling in the presence of decoherence effects stemming from a noisy quantum device. We demonstrate the protocol by applying it to two physical systems: Ising spin chain and SU(2) lattice Yang-Mills theory. To this end, we numerically simulate the time evolution of the two theories in the Hamiltonian formalism. The lattice Yang-Mills theory is implemented with a suitable truncation of Hilbert space on the basis of the Kogut-Susskind formalism. On a two-leg ladder geometry and with the lowest nontrivial spin representations, it can be mapped to a spin chain, which we call the Yang-Mills-Ising model and is also directly applicable to future digital quantum simulations. We find that the Yang-Mills-Ising model shows the signal of information scrambling at late Limes.

J	Xie, YH; Wang, W				Xie, Yihuai; Wang, Wei			Application of Internet of Things Sensor in Intelligent Art-Aided Design	JOURNAL OF SENSORS			English	Article							SYSTEM; HEALTH; IOT	As a new and popular technology, the IoT is deeply affecting the design method of art. It not only brings many benefits but also brings challenges to the field of information storage. The structure of intelligent art-aided design system based on IoT sensor is designed, and the traditional C/S is applied in the application structure. The IoT information storage center needs to design a suitable data storage scheme according to its data characteristics. On the basis of fully mastering the principles and concepts of decorative art and the basic process of art-aided design, according to the magnanimity and temporal and spatial correlation, the application of this data distribution method to art-aided design can significantly improve the efficiency of art design. Experiments show that compared with similar random and Bubba algorithms, this strategy has better performance in system in terms of DM and LBST index. Finally, using the results of the control group and the experimental group, this paper verifies that the art-aided design system of the Internet of things can improve users' design enthusiasm; develop design potential and initiative; improve designers' observation ability, thinking method, and expression ability; and significantly improve users' design ability and design level.

But not every picture is worth the space it occupies. What qualities make a diagram an effective and efficient conduit of information to the human mind? In this article we argue that the best diagrams depict information the same way that our internal mental representations do. That is, "visual thinking" operates largely on relatively sketchy, cartoon-like representations of the physical world, translating sensory input into efficient codes before storing and manipulating it. Effective diagrams will assist this process by stripping away irrelevant detail while preserving or highlighting essential information about objects and their spatial relations. We discuss several examples that illustrate this "Representational Correspondence Principle," and we consider its implications for the design of systems that use diagrams to represent abstract, conceptual knowledge, such as social networks, financial markets, or web content hierarchies.

Abstract The emergence of building information modeling (BIM) methodology requires the training of professionals with both specific and transversal skills. In this paper, a project-based learning experience carried out in the context of a project management course at the University of Extremadura is analyzed. To that end, a questionnaire was designed and given to students who participated in the initiative. Results suggest that BIM can be considered a virtual learning environment, from which students value the competences developed. The emotional performance observed was quite flat. Similarly, students valued the usefulness of the initiative. Students expressed a desire for the methodological change of the university classes, and thought that BIM methodology could be useful for other courses. The results obtained show a line of work to be done to improve the training of students and university teaching.

Design: Pooled cross-sectional survey data. Setting: Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS). Participation: Data included 6 iterations of HINTS (pooled: N = 19 496; 2007: n = 3593; 2011: n = 3959; 2013: n = 3185; Food and Drug Administration [FDA] 2015: n = 3738; 2017: n = 3285; and FDA 2017: n = 1736). Measures: Outcome variables were health information seeking, high confidence, and high trust of health information from several sources. Independent variable was race group, controlling for other sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables. Analysis: Weighted descriptive and multivariate logistic regression for the pooled sample assessed associations by race. Fully interacted models with race-survey year interactions compared differences in outcomes between years. Results: Black respondents, relative to white, had greater odds of having high confidence in their ability to attain health information, trust of health information from newspapers and magazines, radio, internet, television, government, charitable organizations, and religious organizations. Hispanic respondents, relative to white, had lower odds of seeking health information and trusting health information from doctors. They had higher odds of trusting health information from the radio, the internet, television, charitable organizations, and religious organizations. Conclusion: Disparities between races in trust of information sources remained across time. Understanding optimal information media, their reach, and credibility among racial groups could enable more targeted approaches to developing interventions. Our analytical approach minimized limitations present in the HINTS.	[Fareed, Naleef; Swoboda, Christine M.; Jonnalagadda, Pallavi; Walker, Daniel M.; Huerta, R.

Nonetheless, the hardware synthesis of implementations for all possible combinations of directive values is impractical even for simple designs. Addressing this shortcoming, many HLS design space exploration (DSE) strategies have been proposed to devise directive settings leading to high-quality implementations while limiting the number of synthesis runs. All these works require considerable efforts to validate the proposed strategies and/or to build the knowledge base employed to tune abstract models, as both tasks mandate the syntheses of large collections of implementations. Currently, such data gathering is performed ad hoc: 1) leading to a lack of standardization, hampering comparisons between DSE alternatives; and 2) posing a very high burden to researchers willing to develop novel DSE strategies. Against this backdrop, we here introduce DB4HLS, a database of exhaustive HLS explorations comprising more than 100 000 design points collected over four years equivalent of synthesis time. The open structure of DB4HLS allows the incremental integration of new DSEs, which can be easily defined with a dedicated domain-specific language. We think that of our database, available at https://www.db4hls.inf.usi.ch/,https://www.db4hls.inf.usi.ch/, will be a valuable tool for the research community investigating automated strategies for the optimization of HLS-based hardware designs.

VR is not only applied in many industries, but is also used by scholars for education applications as it enables students to have an immersive learning experience to enhance their learning effectiveness and motivation. Therefore, this study combined the spherical video-based virtual reality (SVVR) and a hands-on activity to help fifth-grade students learn natural geomorphological knowledge. The experimental group students used the hands-on approach to design a SVVR system to learn natural geomorphological knowledge; the control group used the conventional SVVR guiding system to learn. From the experimental results, there were non-significant differences in the learning achievement and learning motivation of students in the experimental and control groups. However, the students in the experimental group had better achievement on the in-depth knowledge test. In other words, the experimental group students needed to understand more about the learning content of natural geomorphological knowledge to design the VR system. Moreover, the hands-on approach cultivated their problem-solving and metacognitive skills.

Despite the installation of PGI systems in many cities and their operation for a number of years, the levels of usage of PGI remain much lower than expected. To guide investment and operational decisions, this study examines the existing PGI systems from the drivers' perspective. The results show that PGI is not efficiently used and often ignored by drivers because of the inaccurate or out-of-date nature of the information it is displaying. Habitual behaviour also played an important role in the choices of a car park. However, the results of the research also show that there is a desire for more accurate, dynamic and personalised parking information through different means at pre-trip stage and en-route stage. The results of this survey should provide some guidance in the design of future PGI systems.

J	Wallengren, C; Segesten, K; Friberg, F				Wallengren, Catarina; Segesten, Kerstin; Friberg, Febe			Relatives' information needs and the characteristics of their search for information - in the words of relatives of stroke survivors	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						content analysis; experiences; knowledge need; relatives; stroke	EDUCATION-PROGRAM; FAMILY SUPPORT; CARERS; CAREGIVERS; EXPERIENCES; HEALTH; IMPACT	Aim and objectives. To explore relatives' information needs and the characteristics of their information-seeking process shortly after the stroke event and six months later. Background. Providing relatives of stroke survivors with information is important, as lack of information increases their uncertainty and risk becoming the 'second patient in the family' and early death. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of relatives' information needs and information-seeking process the first six months after stroke. Design. This qualitative study has a descriptive design. Method. Open-ended interviews were conducted with sixteen relatives after stroke survivor's admission to stroke unit and six months later with nine of these relatives. Data were analysed by means of content analysis. Results. The identified information needs covered the spectrum from stroke survivor's medical condition because nurses' actions to relatives' changed health and life situation. Furthermore, relatives' information-seeking process was found to be related to their level of personal involvement, situational circumstances, different forms of knowledge and sources of information. Conclusions. Relatives' search for information emerges when health and lifestyle changes occur in survivors or themselves. It is important that this information affect them personally. Also, they need to develop different forms of knowledge when they cannot trust their own competences. As a result, instead of following established curricula based on their beliefs of relatives' information needs, nurses need to practice on identifying relatives' information needs. Relevance to practice. Different information needs and characteristics described in the study can serve as guidance in the development and implementation of pedagogical interventions to support relatives of stroke survivors. One pedagogical implication is to explore what a specific relative wants to know by how he/she talks or thinks about it. Thus, it must be taken into consideration that level of personal involvement, situational circumstances, sources of information and factual knowledge, understanding and skills are intertwined.

Identifying such a population with an acceptable level of confidence may lead to an inflation in development time and cost. We present all approach that allows to decrease these costs and to increase the reliability of the population selection. It is based on an actual adaptive phase II/III design and uses Bayesian decision tools to select the population of interest at an interim analysis. The primary endpoint is assumed to be the time to some event like e.g. progression. It is shown that the use of appropriately stratified logrank tests in the adaptive test procedture guarantees overall type I error control also when using information on patients that are censored at the adaptive interim analysis. The use of Bayesian decision tools for the population selection decision making is discussed. Simulations are presented to illustrate the operating characteristics of the study design relative to a more traditional development approach. Estimation of treatment effects is considered as well.

Panel members were asked to rate the relative importance of a set of evaluation criteria for biorefinery process implementation at a pulp and paper mill. Three different panels were conducted, each with this same objective. This report compares and assesses the results from the panels. Two of the MCDM panels were comprised of biorefinery specialists of similar backgrounds from government and academia, and the third panel consisted of pulp and paper industry decision makers. In general, consensus was high between all three panels, and especially between the two biorefinery specialist panels; however, certain differences were noted with the industry panel. For three out of eight criteria, these differences were attributable to a difference in the perspective of the forest industry decision makers and biorefinery specialists. For example, for the return on investment criteria, the specialist panels gave a significantly higher importance to current information from technology suppliers because it provides an important short-term perspective. In contrast, the forest industry decision makers thought that information about a particular technology should be critiqued and adjusted based on a systematic assessment of likely future process performance. Differences between the other criteria were attributed to differing interpretations of the criteria.

However, using innovative teaching methods in education can be very challenging for educators. They are directly involved into a teaching process and upcoming changes should be well planned and the impact of the introduced innovations/changes should be estimated in advance. Innovations can be also challenging for a management part of a particular higher education institution, whose major goal is to organize a smooth learning process. Current work presents software empowered innovation in the domain of teaching physics at universities. Authors demonstrate how particular software artefacts could be possible integrated into existing curriculum in order to help students at universities in mastering particular natural science subject (e.g., "Physics-1," "Physics-2"). Software is based on the ideas of virtual laboratories, whether implementation is based on Microsoft. NET XNA Framework and 3D modeling. Paper shows that the introduction of modern information and computer technologies along with the traditional forms of education are significantly enhancing teaching experience and improving education quality.

Methods Fourteen cognitive interviews were conducted in the UK using concurrent and retrospective think-aloud and probing techniques. Each participant completed 8 C-TTO tasks and 8 DCE tasks within a computer-assisted personal interview setting. Verbal information was transcribed verbatim. Axial coding and thematic analysis were used to organise the qualitative data and identify patterns and problems with the completion of tasks. Results While participants found the tasks generally manageable, five broad themes emerged to explain and optimise the response to the tasks. (1) Format and structure: attention to the design of practice examples, instructions, and layout were needed. (2) Items and levels: underlying relationships were discovered across different combinations of levels of SWEMWBS items. (3) Decision heuristics: participants engaged in diverse strategies to assist trade-off decisions. (4) Valuation feasibility: certain states were difficult to imagine, compare and quantify. (5) Valuation outcome: the data quality was affected by participants' discriminatory ability across states and their time trade-off decisions. Conclusion The interviews contributed insights regarding the robustness of the proposed methods. The application of C-TTO and DCE valuation techniques was practical and suitable for capturing individual attitudes towards different mental well-being scenarios. A modified protocol informed by the results is being tested in a larger sample across the UK.

J	Chen, Y				Chen, Yu			Visual Communication Design Based on 5G Technology	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article							CHALLENGES; NETWORK	The progress of science and technology and the rapid development of the Internet have made the visual communication design full of unprecedented yearning and passion for the new scientific and technological civilization. This research mainly discusses the visual communication design under 5G technology. For the fifth generation mobile communication technology (5G), its brand new network architecture design can provide 10 to 20 times higher peak rate, millisecond-level network transmission delay, and 100 billion device-level network connectivity than 4G. It will open up a new era of extensive interconnection of all things and deep human-computer interaction for human society. This paper starts with the relationship between visual communication and various media, so as to prove that the development of mobile media will be inevitable, especially in environment, the visual expression and the innovation in design style. In order to reflect the inner will of the audience in the environment of rapid development of information, this article. It analyzes the changes brought by the development of mobile media to the visual communication design at this stage, predicts the development trend of visual communication, and tries to point out that the development of 5G communication technology is bringing a new round of revolution to the design industry. As a design researcher, it should pay attention to the impact of technological changes on the design field. By exploring suitable design methods, the application of visual communication in mobile media under 5G technology conditions can be better realized. Starting from the background of the evolution and development of media, this paper analyzes the reasons for the rise of 5G technology, as well as the characteristics of 5G technology and its advantages in communication. At the same time, it deeply analyzes the connotation and involved fields of visual communication design and expounds the promotion and influence of the reform of media technology. It focuses on analyzing the development level of 5G technology and the new thinking brought by visual communication design. The article also puts forward the origin of the research. 58.1% of the evaluators were satisfied with the impact of 5G technology on visual communication. Visual design, interaction design, and usability design are all indispensable factors in interface design. When designing, they are not designed in isolation from each other but interact with each other. When carrying out any one of the designs, the design influence of the other two should be combined, and the changes of each one should affect the design of the other two. For example, interaction design and usability issues must be considered when determining the visual presentation of an interface. It can be seen that the design process of the interface is a comprehensive design process. This research helps to advance the development of visual communication design in the future.

J	Busetti, S				Busetti, Simone			Causality is good for practice: policy design and reverse engineering	POLICY SCIENCES			English	Review						Causal mechanisms; Policy design; Policy implementation; Usable knowledge; Practitioner	CLASS-SIZE; SOCIAL MECHANISMS; IMPLEMENTATION; METHODOLOGY; EXPERIENCE; DIAGRAMS; THINKING; FUTURE; WORK	Relevance to practice is an open issue for scholars in public policy and public administration. One major problem is the need to produce knowledge that can guide practitioners designing and implementing public interventions in specific contexts. This article claims that investigating the causal mechanisms of policy programs-i.e., modeling why and how they produce outcomes-can contribute to such knowledge. In this regard, mechanisms offer essential information to guide practitioners when replicating, adjusting, and designing interventions. Unfortunately, not all models of mechanisms can inform practice. The article proposes a strategy for design research and practice inspired by reverse engineering: selecting successful programs, causal modeling, assessing the target context, and designing. Scholars should model mechanisms by identifying the program and non-program elements that contribute to the outcome of interest and abstracting their causal powers. Practitioners can use these models, diagnose their target context, and adjust designs to deal with context-specific problems. The proposed research agenda may enhance orientation to practice and offer a middle ground between the search for abstract, general relationships, and single-case analyses.

The integration of game-based learning with collaborative problem-solving activities designed for historical thinking is expected to help increase learners' motivation. Cognitive scaffolding can provide immediate guidance in educational games to facilitate proper understanding and discussion of historical knowledge among learners. In this study, we used the history educational game "Void Broken 2.0" embedded with cognitive scaffolding to guide students to use their historical thinking skills in collaborative problem-solving tasks, and analyzed the behavioral patterns of the learners in using cognitive scaffolding and discussing historical thinking. The participants in this study were 158 high school students divided into an experimental group (game-based learning) and a control group (reading-based learning). The results showed that the learning activities of both groups contributed to the learning effectiveness, and there was no significant difference between the groups. As the game progressed, students in the experimental group actively utilized the assistance of the cognitive scaffolding. The need for immediate access to the cognitive scaffold's prompts did not increase significantly as the game progressed, and students with high prior knowledge were willing to share their understanding and incorporate more diverse types of information into the discussion. Low prior knowledge students' need for immediate access to the cognitive scaffolding hints increased significantly as the game progressed, and they were more willing to work with their peers to find information related to chronological reasoning, engage in repetitive discussions, and explore possible clues.

An education resource for human papillomavirus oropharyngeal cancer patients: think-aloud interviews	SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER			English	Article						Communication; Head and neck cancer; Human papillomavirus; Oropharyngeal cancer	INFORMATION-SEEKING; HPV; HEALTH; ASSOCIATION; PREVALENCE; DIAGNOSIS; KNOWLEDGE	PurposeThe human papillomavirus (HPV) is well recognised as a factor in developing oropharyngeal cancer (OPC). A booklet for HPV-OPC patients aimed to deliver evidence-based messages in everyday language, in a way to minimise negative psychological impacts on patients. Our study explored the suitability of the booklet for use.MethodsParticipants were recruited through social media and interviewed via Zoom. Participants were shown the booklet and a think-aloud method elicited real-time reactions to the content. Responses were analysed for each section and coded as either for or against for content, with other responses thematically analysed using NVivo.ResultsThe sample comprised 24 participants: patients (n = 19) who completed treatment for HPV-OPC and partners of survivors of HPV-OPC (n = 5). All participants found the booklet useful, and most wished the resource had been available previously. Some indicated the information was new to them. The majority agreed the booklet would be best delivered by their specialist at point of diagnosis and would be a useful resource for friends and family. Most participants gave feedback on improvements to the booklet in terms of comprehension and design. Overall, participants found the content easy to understand. Most participants found that it helped to reduce shame and stigma associated with HPV as a sexually transmitted infection.ConclusionAn evidence-based booklet for HPV-OPC patients and their partners is acceptable. Implementation may be feasible in routine clinical practice, specifically at time of diagnosis. Adapting the content will help optimise the efficacy of the booklet in facilitating communication between all stakeholders.	[Sharman, Ashleigh R. R.; Dodd, Rachael H.

A Systems Thinking Approach to the Structure, Conduct and Performance of the Agricultural Sector in Ghana	SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE			English	Article						allocative efficiency; market analysis; policy decision; market information; business survival	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; AFRICA	The continuous growth in population and consumption, the intensity of competition for land, water and energy and the overexploitation of the ecosystem have all affected Africa's ability to sustain its food security and natural resources. In recent years, many promising agricultural development initiatives were unable to provide sustainable solutions to agricultural challenges in most parts of Africa, including Ghana, as a result of policy failures. The agricultural sector is a complex system and requires a holistic approach to deal with the root causes of challenges. This research therefore uses systems thinking tools, including causal loop diagrams and Bayesian belief network modelling, to develop new structural systems models whereby stakeholders can determine the components and interactions between the structure, conduct and performance (SCP) of the agricultural sector in Ghana, by using the first five steps of the Evolutionary Learning Laboratory. The results illustrate how the SCP elements interact together to influence the survival and growth of the agricultural sector. The study identifies that stakeholders adopt several strategies to survive and compete, which lead to overexploitation of the ecosystem. The results from the Bayesian belief network models indicate that the implementation of systemically determined interventions, policies and strategies could significantly improve the probability of business survival and growth from 58.8 to 73%. Also, the chances of improving the SCP could be increased from 39, 28.3 and 36.4 to 80.1, 55.9 and 62.4%, respectively, and these may vary based on the conditional probability tables. This paper contributes to the systemic approach to SCP, in that improvements to production and allocative efficiency may usher in a greater potential for improving food security, supporting the ecosystem and further strengthening agricultural sustainability.

In this context, understanding the interaction processes of users plays an important role. The analysis of interaction sequences, for example, can provide a deeper understanding about how users solve problems. In this paper we present an analysis of sequences of interactions within a visualization system and compare the results to previous research. We used log file analysis and thinking aloud as methods. There is some indication based on log file analysis that there are interaction patterns which can be generalized. Thinking aloud indicates that some cognitive processes occur together with a higher probability than others. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To help ICU staff manage activities we developed a visual display that monitors and reports sound levels in real-time. This facilitates immediate feedback, encouraging proactive behavior change to limit disturbances. Methods: Following the principles of user-centered design practices we created our 'user persona' to understand the needs and goals of potential users of the system. We then conducted iterative user testing with current members of the ICU team, primarily using the 'think aloud' method to refine the design and functionality of our novel system. Ethnography evaluated team use of the display. Results: The final design was simple, clear, and efficient, and both functional and aesthetically pleasing for the key user demographic. We identified challenges in the implementation and adoption process that were separate from the 'usability' of the system itself. Conclusions: Embedding the design process within the core user demographic ensured the final product delivered relevant information for key users, and that this information was intuitive to interpret. Initiating sustainable change is not straightforward. It requires recognition of cultural practices within teams, departments, professions, organizations, and strategies to maximize engagement.

Fixation patterns in simple choice reflect optimal information sampling	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							DRIFT-DIFFUSION MODEL; DECISION FIELD-THEORY; MULTIALTERNATIVE DECISION; VISUAL FIXATIONS; EYE-TRACKING; GAZE BIAS; TIME; COMPUTATION; ATTENTION; SEARCH	Simple choices (e.g., eating an apple vs. an orange) are made by integrating noisy evidence that is sampled over time and influenced by visual attention; as a result, fluctuations in visual attention can affect choices. But what determines what is fixated and when? To address this question, we model the decision process for simple choice as an information sampling problem, and approximate the optimal sampling policy. We find that it is optimal to sample from options whose value estimates are both high and uncertain. Furthermore, the optimal policy provides a reasonable account of fixations and choices in binary and trinary simple choice, as well as the differences between the two cases. Overall, the results show that the fixation process during simple choice is influenced dynamically by the value estimates computed during the decision process, in a manner consistent with optimal information sampling. Author summary Any supermarket shopper is familiar with the problem of choosing between a small number of items. Even these "simple choices" can be challenging because we have to think about the options to determine which one we like most, and we can't think about all of them at once. This raises a question: what should we think about-and for how long should we think-before making a decision? We formalize this question as an information sampling problem, and identify an optimal solution. Observing what people look at while making choices, we find that many of the key patterns in their eye fixations are consistent with optimal information sampling.

Statistics in Pharmaceutical Development and Manufacturing	JOURNAL OF QUALITY TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Design Space; Drug Manufacturing; FDA; ICH; Opportunity; PAT; Pharmaceutical Industry; Quality by Design; R&D; Statistical Methods; Statistical Thinking; Technical Change	TOTAL ERROR; DESIGN	The pharmaceutical industry is undergoing rapid change and facing numerous challenges, including the demands of global competition, the need to speed up the drug-development process, and the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) expectations for the incorporation of the principles of quality by design (QbD) and process analytical technology (PAT) in process and analytical development. Statistical thinking and methods play a significant role in addressing these issues. This article provides an overview of the use of statistical thinking and methods in the R&D and manufacturing functions of the pharmaceutical industry. The exposition includes the history of pharmaceutical quality and regulation, phases of pharmaceutical development and manufacturing and the basic quality and statistical tools employed in each, emerging statistical methods, the impact of statistical software and information technology, and the role of statisticians in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing. Four case studies are included to illustrate how these issues play out in actuality. A summary provides a succinct synopsis of those issues and concludes that the complex, technical nature of pharmaceutical development and manufacturing offers many opportunities for the effective use of statistical thinking and methods and that those who use these methods can become catalysts for both process-development understanding and product-quality improvement. Additional details can be found in our technical report (Peterson et al. (2009)).

This uncertainty is lessened by the presence of signals that indicate job fitness. Ideally, job applicants objectively signal their qualifications, and those signals are correctly assessed by the hiring team. In reality, signal manipulation is pervasive in the hiring process, mitigating the reliability of signals used to make hiring decisions. To combat these inefficiencies, we propose and evaluate SIGHT, a theoretical class of systems affording more robust signal evaluation during the job application process. A prototypical implementation of the SIGHT framework was evaluated using a mock-interview paradigm. Results provide initial evidence that SIGHT systems can elicit and capture qualification signals beyond what can be traditionally obtained from a typical application and that SIGHT systems can assess signals more effectively than unaided decision-making. SIGHT principles may extend to domains such as audit and security interviews.

As a result, treating these diseases costs $750 billion a year. Nanotechnology, which consists of small (similar to 1-100 nm) but highly tailorable platforms, can provide significant opportunities for improving therapeutic delivery to the brain. Nanoparticles can increase drug solubility, overcome the blood-brain and brain penetration barriers, and provide timed release of a drug at a site of interest. Many researchers have successfully used nanotechnology to overcome individual barriers to therapeutic delivery to the brain, yet no platform has translated into a standard of care for any neurological disease. The challenge in translating nanotechnology platforms into clinical use for patients with neurological disease necessitates a new approach to: (1) collect information from the fields associated with understanding and treating brain diseases and (2) apply that information using scalable technologies in a clinically-relevant way. This approach requires systems-level thinking to integrate an understanding of biological barriers to therapeutic intervention in the brain with the engineering of nanoparticle material properties to overcome those barriers. To demonstrate how a systems perspective can tackle the challenge of treating neurological diseases using nanotechnology, this review will first present physiological barriers to drug delivery in the brain and common neurological disease hallmarks that influence these barriers. We will then analyze the design of nanotechnology platforms in preclinical in vivo efficacy studies for treatment of neurological disease, and map concepts for the interaction of nanoparticle physicochemical properties and pathophysiological hallmarks in the brain.

J	Kuo, TC				Kuo, Tsai Chi			The construction of a collaborative framework in support of low carbon product design	ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Collaborative framework; Design for low carbon products; Carbon footprint; GHG BUM	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; GHG EMISSIONS; FOOTPRINT; SYSTEM	Ideally, carbon information could be disclosed and reduced through the supply chain if a life cycle inventory is well conducted. However, in practice, it has been found through the observation of the past carbon footprint inventories of enterprises that owing to the limited cost and resources, most of these investigations were seldom comprehensively conducted and were not integrated with the existing internal management systems or information systems of the enterprises, but instead were conducted as a special project for target products. Also, most enterprises thought it was time-consuming to conduct these inventories (raw material suppliers, manufacturers, transporters, retailers, customers, and waste processors, numerous suppliers). The main purpose of this study is to construct a collaborative design framework to help enterprises collect and calculate products' carbon footprints in a readily and timely manner throughout the entire supply chain. In this research, a computer aided tool was used to integrate enterprises' internal systems with life cycle inventory database and to establish enterprises' GHGs bills of material system.

To unpack specialist heart failure nurses' decision-making and explore whether viewing a decision as 'hard' or 'easier' is associated with different decision-making characteristics. Background. Specialist heart failure nurses exemplify modern nursing roles. They face diagnostic, prognostic and treatment uncertainties of varying degrees of complexity in the choices they face. Nurses' cognitive handling of complexity is largely unknown. Design. Judgement analysis survey. Methods. Judgement analysis with 29 nurses and two judgement tasks was undertaken. A drug titration decision (classed as 'easier' by nurses) was compared with a 'harder' palliative care referral choice. Measures of agreement between the nurses, the linearity and non-linearity in information processing by nurses and the degree of cognitive control exercised by them were explored. Differences between nurses with varying degrees of education were explored using paired t-testing. The relationship between experience and key measures was explored using bivariate correlations. Results. Nurses varied in their judgements and the weighting afforded to information. Self-reported decision difficulty was less important for cognitive handling of information and agreement between nurses than we predicted. Nurses had high degrees of cognitive control in the drug task and far less in the palliative referral condition. However, there was no change in the linear or non-linear processing of information of the two tasks. Education and clinical experience were not related to agreement or information processing. Conclusions. Nurses' self-reported difficulty in decisions should not be relied upon as valid indicators of decisional complexity. The title 'specialist nurse' should not be assumed to equate by default with clinical expertise. Thinking in a more sophisticated way about the relationship between experience, uncertainty, decision structure and information available may help nurses make better choices. Relevance to clinical practice. Teaching nurses about what makes for hard and difficult decisions and increasing awareness of the decisions they make may lead to better quality choices. Practice developers should pay attention to the quality of clinical experience as well as the quantity when considering decision-making expertise.

Media news articles constitute an essential means by which the public comes into contact with scientific issues. However, not all of the scientific information presented in news articles is trustworthy or accurate. Naturally, the situation becomes more complicated because most university science departments spend little empirical effort considering how to foster undergraduates' scientific media literacy (SML). This article discusses the effect of a teaching-learning sequence (TLS) in (1) providing undergraduates with opportunities to explicitly reflect on the ways in which news articles promote the public (mis)understanding of science and (2) engaging them in argumentative classroom interactions (such as debates). It examines the written and oral arguments produced by 115 undergraduates (62 females and 53 males, 17-23 years old) in Colombia during a complete TLS supervised by the same instructor. The data used in this analysis were collected from students' written responses and audio recordings. The findings suggest that the TLS can be a good start to show undergraduates some of the different ways in which news articles promote the public (mis)understanding of science and, thus, enrich their SML. The study contributes to the development of a research-based university science education that can inform the design of the SML curriculum for higher education.

How do users judge the relevance of such information? Is their relevance judgment affected by contextual factors, such as location and time? How do message content and contextual factors affect users' privacy concerns? With a focus on mobile ads, we propose a research model based on theories of relevance judgment and mobile marketing research. We suggest topicality, reliability, and economic value as key content factors and location and time as key contextual factors. We found mobile relevance judgment is affected mainly by content factors, whereas privacy concerns are affected by both content and contextual factors. Moreover, topicality and economic value have a synergetic effect that makes a message more relevant. Higher topicality and location precision exacerbate privacy concerns, whereas message reliability alleviates privacy concerns caused by location precision. These findings reveal an interesting intricacy in user relevance judgment and privacy concerns and provide nuanced guidance for the design and delivery of mobile commercial information.

We have explored the systematic design of covalent protein kinase inhibitors by learning from kinome-relevant chemical space, followed by focusing on an exemplary kinase of interest. Covalent inhibitors experience a renaissance in drug discovery, especially for targeting protein kinases. However, computational design of this class of inhibitors has thus far only been little investigated. To this end, we have devised a computational approach combining fragment-based design and deep generative modeling augmented by three-dimensional pharmacophore screening. This approach is thought to be particularly relevant for medicinal chemistry applications because it combines knowledge-based elements with deep learning and is chemically intuitive. As an exemplary application, we report for Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a major drug target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and leukemia, the generation of novel candidate inhibitors with a specific chemically reactive group for covalent modification, requiring only little target-specific compound information to guide the design efforts. Newly generated compounds include known inhibitors and characteristic substructures and many novel candidates, thus lending credence to the computational approach, which is readily applicable to other targets.

By observational criteria, a multi-lingual team of experts excerpts concepts from general communication in the media. The team, then, finds equivalent expressions in English, German, French, and Spanish. On the basis of a set of ontological and lexical relations, a conceptual network is built up. Concepts are thought to be universal. Objects unique in time and space are identified by names and will be explained by the universals as their instances. Our approach relies on multi-relational descriptions of concepts. It provides a powerful tool for documentation and conceptual language learning. First and foremost, our multi-lingual, polyhierarchical ontology fills the gap of semantically-based information retrieval by generating enhanced and improved queries for internet search.

Harnessing Technology and Citizen Science to Support Neighborhoods that Promote Active Living in Mexico	JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE			English	Article						Citizen science; Mexico; Active living; Neighborhoods	MEASURED PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; IPEN ADULT; WALKABILITY; OBESITY; CHALLENGES; NEWS; FORM	Middle- and low-income countries bear 80 % of the global chronic disease burden. Population-level, multi-sectoral approaches to promoting healthful lifestyles that take into local physical, socioeconomic, and sociocultural characteristics of both the environment and the population are needed. The "Nuestra Voz (Our Voice)" is one such approach that involves neighborhood residents acting as "citizen scientists" to systematically gather information on the barriers and facilitators of physical activity in their neighborhoods and then use their data to collectively advocate for local environmental- and policy-level changes to support active living. We pilot tested this approach in Cuernavaca, Mexico with adults and adolescents. This community-engaged and participatory approach is driven by residents, who utilize a GPS-enabled electronic tablet-based application with simple audio-based instructions to take photographs and record audio narratives of facets of their neighborhood that promote or hinder active living. After collecting these data, the citizen scientists come together in a community meeting and use their data to prioritize realistic, multi-level changes for promoting active living in their neighborhoods. A survey assessed participants' acceptability of the approach. Participating citizen scientists included 32 adults and 9 adolescents. The citizen scientists rated the acceptability of five of the nine acceptability survey items with an average of 4.0 or higher out of 5.0, indicating they thought it was "fun," were comfortable carrying the tablet, were likely to use it again, and would recommend it to friends and family. Items with average scores of less than 4 were all related to safety concerns. The most common barriers reported by citizen scientists using the tablet were poor sidewalk quality, presence of trash, negative characteristics of the streets, unpleasant aesthetics (e.g., graffiti), and presence of parks and recreational facilities. The Our Voice citizen scientist approach using the Discovery Tool has high potential for assisting communities in diverse settings to begin to identify both local barriers to active living as well as potentially useful strategies for promoting physical activity in culturally congruent ways that are appropriate and feasible in the local context.

Design of non-peptidic small molecules that mimic amino acid side-chain interactions in PPIs ("minimalist mimics") is seen as a way to fast track discovery of PPI inhibitors. However, there has been little comment on general design criteria for minimalist mimics, even though such guidelines could steer construction of libraries to screen against multiple PPI targets. We hypothesized insight into general design criteria for minimalist mimics could be gained by comparing preferred conformations of typical minimalist mimic designs against side-chain orientations on a huge number of PPI interfaces. That thought led to this work which features nine minimalist mimic designs: one from the literature, and eight new "hypothetical" ones conceived by us. Simulated preferred conformers of these were systematically aligned with > 240 000 PPI interfaces from the Protein Data Bank. Conclusions from those analyses did indeed reveal various design considerations that are discussed here. Surprisingly, this study also showed one of the minimalist mimic designs aligned on PPI interface segments more than 15 times more frequently than any other in the series (according to uniform standards described herein); reasons for this are also discussed.

J	Wagner, G; Larsen, P; Brunthaler, S; Franz, M				Wagner, Gregor; Larsen, Per; Brunthaler, Stefan; Franz, Michael			Thinking Inside the Box: Compartmentalized Garbage Collection	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Design; Performance; Experimentation; Garbage collection; isolation; memory management; web-browser architecture		The web browser is the "new desktop." Not only do many users spend most of their time using the browser, the browser has also become host to rich and dynamic applications that were previously tailored to each individual operating system. The lingua franca of web scripting, JavaScript, was pivotal in this development. Imagine that all desktop applications allocated memory from a single heap managed by the operating system. To reclaim memory upon application shutdown, all processes would then be garbage collected-not just the one being quit. While operating systems improved upon this approach long ago, this was how browsers managed memory until recently. This article explores compartmentalized memory management, an approach tailored specifically to web browsers. The idea is to partition the JavaScript heap into compartments and allocate objects to compartments based on their origin. All objects in the same compartment reference each other direct, whereas cross-origin references go through wrapper objects. We carefully evaluate our techniques using Mozilla's Firefox browser-which now ships with our enhancements-and demonstrate the benefits of collecting each compartment independently. This simultaneously improves runtime performance (up to 36%) and reduces garbage collection pause times (up to 75%) as well as the memory footprint of the browser. In addition, enforcing the same-origin security policy becomes simple and efficient with compartments.

Fifty humanities students participated. Mixed-methods data collection included a questionnaire, VR artifacts grades, student reflective journals, and focus group interviews. The most important findings were that (1) the instructional design of the study led to improvement in all of the five competencies of .01 significance or better (2) additional cycles of VR artifact production led to increases in empirical quality, and (3) the participants also found the hands-on VR creation projects to be distinctive and motivating. This VR content creation project provides detailed implications and guidance for instructors seeking to replicate a hands-on technology-oriented instructional design in order to strengthen the 21st-century core competencies.

The Relationship Between Conspiracy Thinking and the Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Among Adult Poles	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						COVID-19; conspiracy thinking; conspiratorial beliefs; anxiety; depression	HOSPITAL ANXIETY; IMPACT; VALIDITY; SCALE	The aim of the study was to describe the relationship between the tendency to believe in false information about the COVID-19 pandemic, tendency to believe in conspiracy theories and the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms among the surveyed Poles. The study was conducted via the Internet in a group of 700 people aged 24.8 +/- 6.3 years (mean +/- SD). 585 females and 110 males were involved. Scales such as Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the original questionnaire COVID-19 Conspiratorial Beliefs Scale (COVID-19 CBS) designed to measure the tendency to believe in false information about COVID-19 pandemic were used. A positive correlation was observed between the tendency to believe in false information about the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19 CBS) and the tendency to believe in general conspiracy theories (GCBS) (r = 0.768; p < 0.001). Moreover, both COVID-19 CBS and GCBS positively correlated with the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms in the study group. For COVID-19 CBS, the correlation coefficients were 0.087 (p < 0.021) and.108 (p < 0.004) for depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, while for GCBS the coefficients were 0.132 (p < 0.001) and 0.147 (p < 0.001). Regression analysis showed that the increased tendency to believe in false beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with an increase in the severity of anxiety (b = 0.04; p = 0.021) and depression (b = 0.06; p < 0.001) symptoms. It can be hypothesized that the tendency to believe in false information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is positively associated with the tendency to general belief in conspiracy theories. False beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic may, at least to some extent, influence the development of anxiety and depression symptoms.

A thought experiment	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							VISUAL-CORTEX; INTEGRATED INFORMATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; NEUROSCIENCE; AWARENESS; REPLAY	Rapid advances in neuroscience have provided remarkable breakthroughs in understanding the brain on many fronts. Although promising, the role of these advancements in solving the problem of consciousness is still unclear. Based on technologies conceivably within the grasp of modern neuroscience, we discuss a thought experiment in which neural activity, in the form of action potentials, is initially recorded from all the neurons in a participant's brain during a conscious experience and then played back into the same neurons. We consider whether this artificial replay can reconstitute a conscious experience. The possible outcomes of this experiment unravel hidden costs and pitfalls in understanding consciousness from the neurosciences' perspective and challenge the conventional wisdom that causally links action potentials and consciousness.

J	Lamberson, WR; Smith, MF				Lamberson, WR; Smith, MF			Encouraging science reading beyond the curriculum	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						extra credit; pedagogy; reading		Students in genetics and reproductive physiology, junior-/senior-level courses with enrollments averaging 76 and 41 students, respectively, were encouraged to read popular science books for extra credit. The objectives of the readings were to reinforce basic class concepts by forming ties to everyday life, and to expose students to a genre that can provide information to prepare them as citizens to engage in the debate over current issues. The books for genetics were The Double Helix, Genome, Voyage of the Beagle, and The Engineer in the Garden; and the books for reproductive physiology were Clone, Lives of a Cell, Life Before Birth and A Time to be Born, and The Second Creation: Dolly and The Age of Biological Control. To earn credit (3% of the course grade for each of up to three books), students had to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of each book during a 15-min discussion with the instructor. Discussions focused on questions designed to stimulate critical thinking about each book's content. For example: "There is approximately 98% homology in DNA sequence between humans and chimpanzees; in aspects ranging from basic physiology to behavior, what makes us similar to or different from the species that is our closest living relative?" The numbers of students reading three books in Years 1 and 2 were 2 and 12 in genetics, and 4 and 3 in reproductive physiology; those reading two books in Years 1 and 2 were 5 and 20 in genetics, and 0 and 2 in reproductive physiology; and those reading one book in Years 1 and 2 were 21 and 31 in genetics, and 7 and 8 in reproductive physiology. The numbers of students that read no books in Years 1 and 2 were 33 and 27 in genetics, and 45 and 20 in reproductive physiology. Participation in the reading project occurred independently of course grades. Sixteen genetics students from the second year's class, eight that had participated in the extra credit reading and eight that had not, volunteered to be reexamined on material from the class. The reexamination was conducted 3 mo after the end of the class. With first exam score fitted as a covariate (P < 0.10), participation in the extra credit reading assignment did not affect score on the reexamination; participants averaged 67% correct answers, nonparticipants averaged 59% (P = 0.37). Comments on course evaluations indicated broad satisfaction with the assignments. Although no improvement of retention could be documented from this project, our objective of encouraging students to engage in reading material supplemental to courses in genetics and reproductive physiology was satisfied.

Prolonged diagnostic intervals are thought to be a key factor in explaining these variations. Primary care practitioners (PCPs) frequently play a crucial role during initial cancer diagnosis; their knowledge could be used to improve the planning of more effective approaches to earlier cancer diagnosis. Objectives This study sought the views of PCPs from across Europe on how they thought the timeliness of cancer diagnosis could be improved. Design In an online survey, a final open-ended question asked PCPs how they thought the speed of diagnosis of cancer in primary care could be improved. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Setting A primary care study, with participating centres in 20 European countries. Participants A total of 1352 PCPs answered the final survey question, with a median of 48 per country. Results The main themes identified were: patient-related factors, including health education; care provider-related factors, including continuing medical education; improving communication and interprofessional partnership, particularly between primary and secondary care; factors relating to health system organisation and policies, including improving access to healthcare; easier primary care access to diagnostic tests; and use of information technology. Re-allocation of funding to support timely diagnosis was seen as an issue affecting all of these. Conclusions To achieve more timely cancer diagnosis, health systems need to facilitate earlier patient presentation through education and better access to care, have well-educated clinicians with good access to investigations and better information technology, and adequate primary care cancer diagnostic pathway funding.

How do healthcare consumers process and evaluate comparative healthcare information? A qualitative study using cognitive interviews	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							PLAN PERFORMANCE INFORMATION; WORLD-WIDE-WEB; OF-CARE; CHOICE; COMPREHENSION; PREFERENCES; DECISIONS; IMPACT; POLICY; CHOOSE	Background: To date, online public healthcare reports have not been effectively used by consumers. Therefore, we qualitatively examined how healthcare consumers process and evaluate comparative healthcare information on the Internet. Methods: Using semi-structured cognitive interviews, interviewees (n = 20) were asked to think aloud and answer questions, as they were prompted with three Dutch web pages providing comparative healthcare information. Results: We identified twelve themes from consumers' thoughts and evaluations. These themes were categorized under four important areas of interest: (1) a response to the design; (2) a response to the information content; (3) the use of the information, and (4) the purpose of the information. Conclusion: Several barriers to an effective use of comparative healthcare information were identified, such as too much information and the ambiguity of terms presented on websites. Particularly important for future research is the question of how comparative healthcare information can be integrated with alternative information, such as patient reviews on the Internet. Furthermore, the readability of quality of care concepts is an issue that needs further attention, both from websites and communication experts.

J	Snobelen, SD				Snobelen, Stephen D.			'BY NUMBER, WEIGHT AND MEASURE': WISDOM 11:20, THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE AND ISAAC NEWTON	LIAS-JOURNAL OF EARLY MODERN INTELLECTUAL CULTURE AND ITS SOURCES			English	Article						Isaac Newton; alba amicorum; Apocrypha; natural philosophy; physico-theology		At least four times from 1716 to 1724, travelling students from the Continent asked Isaac Newton to inscribe their autograph books. On those occasions, Newton chose as his epigram a line from Wisdom 11:20: 'God has established all things by number, weight and measure'. Why did Newton choose this text from the Apocrypha as his motto? This essay seeks to provide a comprehensive answer to this question by placing Newton's personal use of Wisdom 11:20 within the expanding concentric rings of his intellectual peers, early modern thought, and the long history of the use of the Sapiential Triad. With this evidentiary structure in place, this essay assesses how Newton's deployment of Wisdom 11:20 is consistent with what we already knew of his thought, what this testimony might add to our understanding of his views on the relationship between God and natural philosophy, and why some of Newton's contemporaries associated him with the passage. Along the way, there are encounters with creation theology, the design argument, Platonism, and the distinctions between voluntarism and intellectualism. Ultimately, this essay has three main goals: to highlight the important place of the Sapiential Triad in the history of science; to suggest why Newton deployed it; and to recover its use in early paeans to Newtonianism.	[Snobelen, Stephen D.] Univ Kings Coll, Halifax, NS, Canada		Snobelen, SD (corresponding author), Univ Kings Coll, Halifax, NS, Canada.	snobelen@dal.ca			University of King's College	University of King's College	Although I first encountered Augustine's use of Wisdom 11:20d well over a decade ago in reading Harrison's The Fall of Man and the Foundations of Science (2007) for a book review, and first learned of Newton's use of the line as an epigram in 2012 when I came across the 1998 Sotheby's catalogue entry on the 1716 album amicorum entry, it was only in the late spring of 2017 that I began to explore Newton's use of Wisdom 11:20d and its prior use by figures relevant to the history of theology and the history of science for what began simply as a footnote in my project on the relationship between science and religion in Newton's thought. In its narrowest sense, this paper is about four short jottings that Newton would have completed in about one minute apiece. At first glance this seems an unlikely premise for a paper of this nature and scope. But as this essay reveals, the topic has become for me much more than a mere footnote as I discovered the story was much richer than originally anticipated. In becoming an interdisciplinary study by taking me into many academic fields, I incurred many debts. I am grateful for help of various kinds from Marco Baretta, Bill Barker, Philip Beeley, Fabrizio Bigotti, Ted Davis, Jason Dean, Graham Dolan, Patrick Doorly, Joseph Hone, Rob Iliffe, Patricia Fara, Mordechai Feingold, Kyle Fraser, Matt Goldish, George Gomori, Sandy Gourlay, Carma Gorman, Paul Greenham, Niccolo Guicciardini, Stuart Handley, John Henry, Faye Hiscock, Michael Joalland, Clifford Jones, Megan Krempa, Dmitri Levitin, Antoni Malet, Scott Mandelbrote, Remus Manoila, Maureen Mulvihill, Bill Newman, Federico Orsi, Maria Portuondo, Lawrence Principe, Jean-Louis Quantin, Karen Reeds, Adam Richter, Jean-Michel Roessli, Anna Marie Roos, Tina Skouen, Charlotte Sleigh, Liz Smith, Ian Stewart, Pablo Toribio, Karin Verelst, Nick Wilding and Paul Wood. I would also like to thank the journal editor, Stefan Bauer, along with the two anonymous referees whose suggestions helped me to improve the paper. Remus Manoila examined Newton's copies of books by Henry More, Robert Boyle and Henry Newton at the Wren Library for me prior to my later visits to Cambridge; I am grateful for his professionalism. Thanks are also due to Patricia Chalmers of the University of King's College Library for valiantly tracking down a series of books and articles, as well as staff at the Cambridge University Library; Duke University Library; University of Glasgow Library; the Library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; -Huntington Library; King's College, Cambridge Library; Linda Hall Library; the Royal Society of London Library; the Tate Galleries, London; Uppsala University Library; -Westminster Abbey; and the State Library of Wurttemberg, Stuttgart. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the support of the University of King's College in the form of travel grants for the years 2018 and 2019.		355	0	0	1	1	PEETERS	LEUVEN	BONDGENOTENLAAN 153, B-3000 LEUVEN, BELGIUM	2033-4753	2033-5016		LIAS	LIAS		2021	48	2					195	308		10.2143/LIAS.48.2.3291474	http://dx.doi.org/10.2143/LIAS.48.2.3291474			114	Humanities, Multidisciplinary	Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI)	Arts & Humanities - Other Topics	VM3BB					2024-01-21	WOS:000994366200001
