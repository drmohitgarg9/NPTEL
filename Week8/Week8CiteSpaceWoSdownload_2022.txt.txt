AB Professor emerita Linda C. Smith designed a plan of study including her bachelor's degree, various master's degrees, a PhD, and a certifi-cate along with practical experience that prepared her for her career as a library and information science (LIS) educator, researcher, and administrator. The pairing of a deep respect and admiration for con-tent and delivery is the common thread that weaves reliably across Smith's fifty years in LIS as an innovator, educator, and researcher. All that she has initiated and accomplished across that time and moving forward can also be said to be "by design"-a potent mix of experience, anticipation, an eye for identifying what is missing, and a determination to doggedly research and implement an elegant "fix" for addressing that gap. This paper explores the common thread of Smith's innovations as a LIS educator, tracing her past and continu-ing influence on the evolution of LIS curriculum content and de-livery, and where it is reflected in, even predicted for contemporary and future graduate programs in information. Suggesting a tenet of design thinking, the authors examine Smith's career path and many contributions to confirm that one can get here from there.

AB Purpose This study aims to investigate the information literacy (IL) performance and higher order thinking skills of students with different levels of growth mindset and their perceptions of library-supported learning by using the annotate, summarize, question and evaluate (ASQE)-based learning approach. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the ASQE-based learning approach was applied to the learning activities to cultivate students' IL, problem-solving awareness and critical thinking tendency. A total of 60 postgraduate students were invited to participate in this study. In addition, students' perceptions of library-supported learning were analysed via drawing analysis. Findings Introducing ASQE-based learning into an IL learning activity promoted reflection and thought and had positive effects on students' problem-solving awareness and on the critical thinking tendency of students with different levels of growth mindset. Additionally, the drawing analysis indicated that most of the students with low levels of growth mindset believed that learners should actively study in the library and students with higher levels of growth mindset preferred more motivating and enjoyable learning environments. Originality/value The findings of this study demonstrate that the ASQE-based learning approach can improve higher order thinking skills of students with different levels of growth mindset. In addition, this study examined the perceptions of students with different levels of growth mindset of library-supported learning via drawing analysis.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to use spatial thinking (space-time) as a lens through which to examine the ways in which the socio-economic conditions and values of the post-Fordist academy work to diminish and even subsume the immaterial affective labour of librarians even as it serves to reproduce the academy. Design/methodology/approach The research question informing this paper asks, In what ways does spatial thinking help us to better understand the immaterial, invisible and gendered labour of academic librarians' public service work in the context of the post-Fordist university? This question is explored using a conceptual approach and a review of recent library information science (LIS) literature that situates the academic library in the post-Fordist knowledge economy. Findings The findings suggest that the feminized and gendered immaterial labour of public service work in academic libraries - a form of reproductive labour - remains invisible and undervalued in the post-Fordist university, and that academic libraries function as a procreative, feminized spaces. Originality/value Spatial thinking offers a corrective to the tendency in LIS to foreground time over space. It affords new insights into the spatial and temporal aspects of information work in the global neoliberal knowledge economy and suggests a new spatio-temporal imaginary of the post-Fordist academic library as a site of waged work.

ID INFORMATION LITERACY
AB Background: A growing body of research demonstrates that adapting the popular entertainment activity "escape rooms" for educational purposes as an innovative teaching method can improve the learning experience. Escape rooms promote teamwork, encourage analytical thinking, and improve problem solving. Despite the increasing development and use of escape rooms in health sciences programs and academic libraries, there is little literature on the use of this method in health sciences libraries with health professions students.Case Presentation: Staff at a health sciences library collaborated with faculty to incorporate escape rooms into library instruction in a variety of settings (in-person, hybrid, online) and formats (team, individual) with health professions students from various disciplines (optometry, pharmacy, medicine). The escape rooms described in this paper offered unique experiences for students through active learning.Discussion: Important considerations when planning escape rooms for health sciences library instruction include deciding on team-based or individual design, calculating potential costs in time and money, deciding on an in-person, hybrid, or online format, and determining whether grades should be assigned. Escape rooms can be an effective strategy for library instruction in the health sciences, working in multiple formats to bring game-based learning to a variety of health professions students.

AB As knowledge workers, library staff are assumed to be highly autonomous, meaning that they are in control of how work is done. Yet, this work is heavily influenced by the expectations of others, and the expectation to take control can pressure staff to overwork. In this qualitative study, 13 public library staff members engaged in think-alouds (TAs) and semi-structured interviews (SSIs) aimed at uncovering potential misalignments between a staff member's own prescriptive expectations for library work and the expectations of management, customers, colleagues, and technological and material artifacts. Findings suggest that public library staff have several expectations for how work will be done and, at times, want the freedom to control work in ways that match these expectations. They devise and implement defiance workarounds aimed at reinforcing their own expectations in the face of conflicting expectations from other system actors. Yet, autonomy is a multifaceted concept that goes beyond the mere need for control and, sometimes, giving up control meant that other needs were fulfilled. This study advances research on the nature of workplace autonomy and the active role of workers in its expression. This study also has implications for library management, as it suggests important considerations for shared autonomy and workplace relationships, as well as the need to engage in efforts aimed at shifting problematic expectations in the library work system.

AB This article explores the tensions and contradictions in the potential success of maker-learning in Higher Education (HE) as supported in academic library makerspaces. Insights are formed from an in-depth, Cultural-Historical Activity Theory framed case study on a well-established North American HE academic library-based makerspace service. Lessons are drawn from the organisational tensions that emerged as challenges in its development. Participants were from the library service, students and academics from different disciplines that make significant use of the library makerspace. The 'relational agency' and 'common knowledge' of academic librarians in bringing together academic and student perspectives on the utility of maker-learning is found to be key. Maker-learning is observed to be an intertwined embodied/haptic, social/dialogic and rational/critical expansive cross-disciplinary system in a Zone of Proximal Development. Evidence of attempts to address the themes of inclusivity, diversity and sustainability to achieve ethical-maker-learning outcomes are discussed and developed. The article then expands on Ratto's Critical Maker pedagogy utilised by the case study library service. I conclude with the proposal of a potentially transformative new concept for supporting cross-disciplinary maker-learning systems, 'Critical Material Literacy' (CML), whereby technical and material awareness connects with progressive concerns for people and the planet. This new theoretical concept is designed to start proactively addressing the key case study themes, with academic librarians becoming critical agents in creating ethical-maker knowledge hubs.

AB In this study, the role of science and computational thinking (CT) in teaching self-efficacy and design thinking variables were examined to explain the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) knowledge forms needed by science teachers for integrated Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) within the framework of the TPACK framework. 216 teachers working as science teachers in Turkey participated in the research. In the study, data were collected in an electronic form consisting of five parts. The model proposed in the research was tested with the partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method. The research showed that the self-efficacy of science teachers was related to technological pedagogical engineering knowledge (TPEK), T- integrated (I) STEM, and technological pedagogical science knowledge (TPSK). In addition, the self-efficacy of science teachers is also effective in design thinking. CT teaching self-efficacy has a positive effect on design thinking and the development of technological pedagogical mathematics knowledge (TPMK), TPEK, and TPSK structures. Design thinking skill is also related to TPMK, TPEK, and TPSK structures. These results can be a guide to ensure the effectiveness of professional development programs that will be prepared to improve science teachers' integrated STEM competencies.

ID LIBRARY; DESIGN
AB The field of Library and Information Science (LIS) has historically struggled to connect theory and practice in its graduate education, specifically when it comes to building partnerships with diverse stakeholders in public library communities. One possible technique for bridging the gap of stakeholder experiences is academically based community service (ABCS) courses. ABCS courses attempt to directly focus on research-practitioner partnerships to solve real-world problems by involving the community to democratically co-design the curriculum. In this paper, we present a reflective case study of an ABCS course on integrating participatory design methods to co-design new digital learning activities for youth in an urban public library. By conducting 10 co-design sessions and 26 semi-structured interviews, we examined a partnership between a university and a library, and how this ABCS course impacted different stakeholder participation. Our findings highlight how ABCS courses require systematic structural endeavors from higher education and care between all stakeholders within a library setting. This work contributes to a growing body of work that calls for more courses in LIS education with greater civic and democratic engagement between graduate students, university partners, and library stakeholders.

AB Research diaries as a qualitative method are found practical in information science. In information behavior literature, they are effective for capturing human experience and thought in situ in emic view. Although previous scholars undertook research diaries to explore information needs, seeking, use, and more, what is left relatively unknown is how this method may garner diverse forms of data beyond text when studying inherently dynamic information creation. To address this gap, this study applied research diaries inspired by cultural probes and maker documentation to investigate the making process of 25 arts and crafts hobbyists. Findings present a wide variety of entries generated from participants, illuminating the benefits of using research diaries to facilitate making and encourage reflection. Design implications are shared to unlock the potential of research diaries for examining information behavior, demonstrating their value in gathering rich empirical data and bringing participants engaging research experiences.

AB Design science is a recognized information systems research paradigm, which is fundamentally centered on problem solving through technology design. The design process involves reflexive thinking and exploration and is usually supported by a variety of visual artifacts, which facilitate structuring, combining, and communicating design knowledge. Visual artifacts are among possible main contributions of a design science endeavor. In this study, we analyze the nature and purpose of such visual artifacts. We adopt semiotics and a theory of visualization of thought, in combination with a literature review, to elaborate a framework of design science visual artifacts. We consider three domains of analysis: intentionality, form-and-function, and visual scheme. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework using two examples. Finally, we define a set of properties that researchers should consider when creating and using visual artifacts in design science: transparency of the relationship between representation and object, self-sufficiency of the visual artifact, and consistency of knowledge communication. The proposed framework helps researchers understand what properties should be focused on when developing their visual artifacts.

AB Purpose: Design thinking is a process for identifying solutions to problems in certain contexts. The better one understands contextual factors affecting use and interaction, the more effectively one can use design thinking to address issues at the context and greater systems levels. This article examines how the cognitive science concepts of scripts and prototypes can help realize the potential of design thinking in different settings.
   Method: This article compares design thinking approaches for understanding context to concepts of context as examined in the cognitive mechanisms of prototypes and scripts. Through this comparison, the author explains how to integrate scripts and prototypes into design thinking processes in order to enhance understandings of context and the success of design thinking approaches to context-related problems.
   Results: The article reveals that prototypes and scripts can expand design thinking approaches and enhance the development of design solutions for addressing problems at local and greater systems levels.
   Conclusions: Technical communicators can use the approach presented here to enhance design thinking processes in order to better address problems in or design products for specific contexts.

AB The methodology of biomimicry design thinking is based on and builds upon the overarching patterns that all life abides by. "Cultivating cooperative relationships" within an ecosystem is one such pattern we as humans can learn from to nurture our own mutualistic and symbiotic relationships. While form and process translations from biology to design have proven accessible by students learning biomimicry, the realm of translating biological functions in a systematic approach has proven to be more difficult. This study examines how higher education students can approach the gap that many companies in transition are struggling with today; that of thinking within the closed loops of their own ecosystem, to do good without damaging the system itself. Design students should be able to assess and advise on product design choices within such systems after graduation. We know when tackling a design challenge, teams have difficulties sifting through the mass of information they encounter, and many obstacles are encountered by students and their professional clients when trying to implement systems thinking into their design process. While biomimicry offers guidelines and methodology, there is insufficient research on complex, systems-level problem solving that systems thinking biomimicry requires. This study looks at factors found in course exercises, through student surveys and interviews that helped (novice) professionals initiate systems thinking methods as part of their strategy. The steps found in this research show characteristics from student responses and matching educational steps which enabled them to develop their own approach to challenges in a systems thinking manner. Experiences from the 2022 cohort of the semester "Design with Nature" within the Industrial Design Engineering program at The Hague University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands have shown that the mixing and matching of connected biological design strategies to understand integrating functions and relationships within a human system is a promising first step.

AB Animals, specially companion species, are an integral part of our daily homes and cities but have not been the focus of everyday information behavior research to date. The practice of incorporating animals into research is not straightforward because they do not share our language or norms. The question this research aims to answer is: how can the perspective of other animal subjects be incorporated in information behavior research? This preliminary study of four multispecies families, included humans, dogs, and cats in the research design, and a more-than-human perspective was used as a research paradigm, offering different ways of thinking about ethnography and phenomenology methods. Five methodological strategies (speaking for the animal, listening differently, walking and sensing, photography, and technological mediation) proved effective in making the role of animals in the information experience of multispecies family visible. The article concludes with a discussion of the methodological implications that emerge when a researcher claims to view humans as conjoined with other life forms and seeks to include animals in information behavior research.

AB This paper investigates how information systems design professionals use design principles (extracted from a prior design science research project) in a new design situation. We do this by capturing think-aloud protocols from experienced design professionals who are given access to potentially useful design principles. Our analysis identifies two dimensions of use: design behaviors (what designers do) and application modes (how designers apply the principles). Mapping across the dimensions suggests two use pathways: forward chaining and backward chaining. Our study shows how empirically studying expert designers can shed light on the microprocesses of design principles in use, and how an empirical turn in the investigation can contribute to clarifying the fundamental nature of design principles. We conclude by highlighting the implications of these insights for crafting more useful design principles.

AB Purpose This research aims to discover the relationship between social media usage (SMU) and the critical thinking ability (CTA) of university students, and to answer the question that whether social media dependence (SMD) affects the development of CTA, and thus providing a reference for the social media access strategy of academic libraries from the perspective of media information literacy. Design/methodology/approach The research data were collected via 300 valid questionnaires whose respondents are students from three universities in China. Multistage stratified cluster sampling method was used to select the respondents, which guarantees statistical representativeness. A pre-test was conducted to ensure the validity of the questionnaire. Findings It is shown that the total score of CTA and the six sub-dimensions are significantly positively correlated with SMU, but strongly negatively correlated with SMD. Based on the mediating effect testing, it is discovered that the degree of SMD can affect the promoting relations between the usage intensity of social media (UISM) and CTA. Clearly, SMU is a double-edged sword. While it narrows the digital gap in terms of accessibility, it widens the digital gap in terms of usage. Originality/value The differences in SMU have a significant impact on the development of CTA of university students. This inspires us to consider the ability of "using social media in a balanced way" as an important evaluation and training direction when inquiring media literacy. As social media is becoming a critical channel in cultivating individual's thinking skills, it is highly suggested that the amount of time spent on reading fragmented information on the internet should be controlled.

AB Educational robotics is an effective carrier of information technology education, making its way into classrooms. However, the design of the educational robotic arm kit and the study on the effect of robotic arms on students' thinking literacy remain to be completed. In this paper, iArm, a 6-DOF robotic arm consisting of a drive chassis, an arm body, and end tools, is presented. Its auxiliary modules, including the vision module and conveyor belt, and the curriculum targeting students' computational thinking are also developed to refine the current educational robotic arm kit. Furthermore, to explore the effectiveness of the iArm kit, thirteen high school students participated in the semester-long curriculum, completed assigned projects, and filled out the pre-test and post-test scales. By formative and summative evaluation, the result shows that the iArm kit effectively enhanced students' computational thinking.

AB The ability of human beings to live longer is an outstanding achievement of science in the 21st century. New technologies and innovations have an essential role in ensuring the well-being of the new generation. By adopting Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, it is possible to improve autonomy, security, and quality of life. However, designing IoT solutions for Home Care and older users brings new challenges to the Human-Computer Interaction field. Older users are heterogeneous and critical users of technology and interactive solutions. In this context, it is necessary to promote the participation of older users in the design process aiming at considering their specificities, intentions of use, and individual preferences and necessities. We propose a co-design method based on Design Thinking and Personas. Our research contributes to methods and a case study assessment regarding IoT-based Home Care solutions' co-design. The proposed approach considers older users' wishes and needs in an iterative, creative, and participatory way. We tested the proposed method in a case study with nine older adults. Results indicate the effectiveness and difficulties of involving older users in the design process. Our results contribute to a better understanding of how to carry out participatory activities with older adults in the context of Home Care.

AB Design Science Research (DSR) in the information systems (IS) field is, at its essence, about Digital Innovation (DI). Innovative sociotechnical design artifacts involve digital information technologies (IT) being used in ways that result in profound disruptions to traditional ways of doing business and to widespread societal changes. The pervasiveness of DI means that the individuals involved in bringing it about have diverse backgrounds, including application specialists, software engineers, data scientists, business managers, economists, venture capitalists, various user groups, and entrepreneurial leaders. This range of backgrounds means that DI, much more than traditional innovation, leads to varied perspectives on the methods and tools to be used in the development of effective and evolvable complex systems incorporating digital innovations. In this paper we present a new matrix approach to DI based on DSR, entrepreneurship, and innovation theories. Clear strategic guidance allows these multiple stakeholders to make sense of the diverse landscape and to understand when and how different entrepreneurial strategies for innovation can best be applied. We define the combined DSR and DI matrix approach in terms of four strategies: invention; advancement; exaptation; and exploitation and their associated DI practices. The research contribution is a novel DSR-DI matrix process model. This model extends entrepreneurship theory as it enriches effectuation thinking with more detailed process guidance for ambidextrous entrepreneurship and it enriches DSR models for DI by showing more explicitly the different pathways corresponding to different quadrants in the knowledge-innovation matrix.

AB The purpose of this paper is to propose an integrated digital transformation system framework (IDTSF) to help support business leaders and teams in making their products, services, and operations more streamlined and competitive. The framework will help organizations to best meet user/customer needs with minimum waste and time and enables businesses to achieve efficiency compared with island and traditional sequential approaches. The proposed framework can also provide insights to help organizations to avoid common failures when deploying digital transformation initiatives. The paper follows the design science research (DSR) and the information systems design science research (ISDSR) methodologies to develop the IDTSF model and a practical design artifact. The main problems were the initiation, execution, and governance challenges associated with digital transformation. After identifying the problems and the objectives, a relevant IDTSF model was synthesized and tested as a design artifact. The results of the test of the proposed artifact showed its effectiveness and efficiency in facilitating the components of the model in creating a cohesive framework.

AB Recent years have witnessed significant achievements and technological advances in citizen science (CS) projects; nevertheless, significant global challenges are present. Proof of this is in the joint efforts of international organizations to achieve the 2030 SDG agenda in a complex environment. Thus, UNESCO has recognized CS as being among the initiatives that could bridge the Science, Technology, and Innovation gap as a substantial resource, given its power to bring the general public closer together. Although tech-based CS projects keep rising, there is limited knowledge about which type of projects might allow participants to develop higher-order complex thinking skills. To that end, this study describes a systematic literature review (SLR) and analysis of 49 CS projects over the last 5 years concerning the technology utilized, the level of citizen involvement, and the intended social impact. The results of the analysis evidenced: (a) broad implementation in Europe on issues of the built environment, disaster risk, and environmental and animal monitoring; (b) prevalence of helix configurations other than the triple, quadruple, and quintuple helix innovation models; (c) a focus on technological developments to improve living conditions in cities; (d) an opportunity to develop applied native technologies; (e) limited development of participants' complex thinking, when constrained to low levels of involvement; and (f) an opportunity to develop native technologies and promote a higher level of citizen participation, leading to more significant impact whilst developing complex thinking.

ID ACHIEVEMENT
AB Information and communications technology (ICT) is now widely used in education. However, the effect of ICT on the development of students' scientific higher-order thinking skills (S-HOTS) is a controversial issue in science education research. This has attracted significant attention from researchers worldwide in the field of educational technology. Purpose In this study, a novel framework for students' S-HOTS is proposed based on Marzano's new taxonomy to determine the impact of ICT on S-HOTS. And exploring the difference in the impact of ICT on S-HOTS in two different countries. Sample The data for this study were obtained from the Science Assessment and ICT Familiarity Questionnaire of the PISA 2015 survey for Finnish and Chinese students. This survey measures the differences in economic and educational levels and literacy in each country and tests the knowledge and skills necessary for life in reading, mathematics, and science for students (15 years old), through a detailed pre-testing country field study to make the results comparable across countries. Design and methods We used the Delphi methodology to determine the framework of S-HOTS and a regression analysis to analyse the effects of ICT on students' S-HOTS. Results The results demonstrate how the availability, use frequency and use time of ICT affect S-HOTS. Furthermore, we compared the results between China (9841 students) and Finland (2538 students), and these findings demonstrated that ICT use at school has a negative effect on S-HOTS, especially ICT use time in school. We also found that using an interactive whiteboard positively and significantly affects S-HOTS. Conclusion The results suggest that the effect of ICT use on S-HOTS in school depends on the ICT method combined with the learning process. Consequently, the use of ICT in schools should be viewed dialectically to promote students' S-HOTS.

AB In recent years, the integration of STEM disciplines has been increasingly advocated. It is crucial to prepare and support teachers for integrated STEM education. However, few studies in the literature explore collaborating with teachers from different disciplines. This study investigates the effect of the professional development (PD) program designed for integrated STEM education on teachers' pedagogical design competencies and the contribution of the PD program to teachers' integrated STEM understanding. The pedagogical design competencies of the teachers were examined in terms of the level of conformity of the lesson plans they prepared based on the 5E learning model and how they unified the computational thinking components into STEM education. The program comprised 48 h and five modules. 20 computer science (CS), ten mathematics, and ten science teachers working in middle schools participated in the study. The study shows that the lesson plans developed collaboratively by the teachers were at an acceptable level in terms of integrated STEM education. However, lesson plans need to be improved. Regarding computational thinking, the teachers were more efficient in associating simulation in CS education, data analysis in mathematics education, and data collection in science education compared to other components. They were insufficient in associating components such as parallelization in CS education and automation in science and mathematics education. The teachers stated that PD program strengthens their collaboration with colleagues, contributes to pedagogical design skills in integrated STEM lesson planning and integrating STEM disciplines, and improves their understanding of integrated STEM.

AB Purpose The practice of renovation and construction of university libraries is flourishing, but how to attract readers to use the library is an issue that urgently needs to be explored. Spatial cognition is a subjective judgment of a person's tendency to take action in the future and implies behavioral intention. Based on the sensory-image-cognition relationship, a theoretical model of university library readers' spatial cognition is conducted, and the influencing factors and mechanisms of spatial cognition are explored based on empirical data to provide theoretical references for spatial practices in university libraries. Design/methodology/approach A visual and art-based mental map approach is introduced based on a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire is mainly used for the specific evaluation of spatial use and the breakdown of the detailed elements, while the mental map method is mainly used for the evaluation of readers' spatial cognition. Relevant empirical data are collected from the library of the Zhejiang University of Technology. Findings The results indicate that readers' spatial sensory experience and mental imagery have positive effects on readers' behavior via the mediator spatial cognition, readers' spatial sensory experience and mental imagery have a positive effect on readers' spatial cognition and spatial cognition has a significant effect on readers' behavior. Originality/value The main contribution of this study is to construct a theoretical model of readers' spatial cognition and to explore the factors that have an impact on spatial cognition and the influence of cognition on behavior. This provides a more rational and in-depth thinking paradigm for the study of university library space and provides theoretical references for library practice.

AB This study addresses intergenerational learning processes in informal settings by investigating families engaging in science talk and practices during a water quality science workshop led by local science experts. As part of a larger design-based research study, this analysis examines how modified Think-Pair-Share discussion prompts within the water quality workshop curriculum supported the families' (a) sensemaking strategies and (b) place-based scientific reasoning about local water sources as they interacted with a community water model. Using sociocultural theories of learning as our foundational basis, we analyzed parent-child interactions and family sensemaking processes that took place in four workshops with 44 h of video data (12 families). Through our analysis, we identified six distinct types of sensemaking conversations that arose during the workshops: (1) family experience connection, (2) rural connection, (3) model contextualizing, (4) parent revoicing, (5) parent questioning, and (6) prediction. We also found that families spatially distributed physical gestures over three media (air, table, community water model) to support different types of sensemaking conversations. Our findings point towards the importance of family discussion prompts in informal programs as a mediational means that connects abstract science topics to local, rural experiences to support family sensemaking practices. Implications for designing family-focused science workshops in informal settings include designing discussion prompts to spark families' personally relevant connections with science and providing ample physical space for families to gesture during sensemaking conversations.

AB Individuals learn to develop problem solving strategies and make connections between their mathematical ideas while programming, so they have the opportunity to improve their thinking skills. Scratch provides an environment to experience problem scenarios and encourages them to act out imagination while having fun. The purpose of the study is to investigate the development of reflective thinking skills towards problem solving and computational thinking of elementary school students based on their Scratch instruction. The study used a sequential exploratory design as a mixed method approach with 524 students and 8 mathematics teachers. The results of the study revealed that Scratch significantly strengthened students' reflective thinking skills for problem solving and computational thinking. Based on the results, the reflective thinking towards problem solving and computational thinking did not vary by gender. In addition, Scratch instruction led to positive reflections in the mathematical learning environment.

AB Background Management of child health care can be negatively affected by incomplete recording, low data quality, and lack of data integration of health management information systems to support decision making and public health program needs. Given the importance of identifying key determinants of child health via capturing and integrating accurate and high-quality information, we aim to address this gap through the development and testing requirements for an integrated child health information system. Subjects and Methods A five-phase design thinking approach including empathizing, defining, ideation, prototyping, and testing was applied. We employed observations and interviews with the health workers at the primary health care network to identify end-users' challenges and needs using tools in human-centered design and focus group discussion. Then, a potential solution to the identified problems was developed as an integrated maternal and child health information system (IMCHIS) prototype and tested using Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation Model (SQuaRE) ISO/IEC 25000. Results IMCHIS was developed as a web-based system with 74 data elements and seven maternal and child health care requirements. The requirements of "child disease" with weight (0.26), "child nutrition" with weight (0.20), and "prenatal care" with weight (0.16) acquired the maximum weight coefficient. In the testing phase, the highest score with the weight coefficient of 0.48 and 0.73 was attributed to efficiency and functionality characteristics, focusing on software capability to fulfill the tasks that meet users' needs. Conclusion Implementing a successful child health care system integrates both maternal and child health care information systems to track the effect of maternal conditions on child health and support managing performance and optimizing service delivery. The highest quality score of IMCHIS in efficiency and functionality characteristics confirms that it owns the capability to identify key determinants of child health.

AB Many countries adopted lockdown measures to curb the spread of the outbreak in 2020, while information about COVID-19 has dominated various media outlets, which has led to information overload for people. However, previous research has mainly focused on cancer information overload and the corresponding consequence, and failed to examine its adverse effects in the context of major public health events. Based on the Frustrate Aggression Theory and the Scapegoat Theory, the present study established a moderated mediation model to investigate the emotional and behavioral outcomes of COVID-19 information overload. The mediating role of depression/anxiety in the association between COVID-19 information overload and cyber aggression, as well as the moderating role of Confucian responsibility thinking, were tested. This model was examined with 1005 Chinese people (mean age = 26.91 years, SD = 9.94) during the COVID-19 outbreak. Mediation analyses revealed that COVID-19 information overload was positively related to cyber aggression, depression, and anxiety, parallelly and partially mediated this relationship. Moderated mediation analyses further indicated that Confucian responsibility thinking not only moderated the direct link between COVID-19 information overload and cyber aggression, with the effect being significant only for people with a low level of Confucian responsibility thinking, but also moderated the relationship between COVID-19 information overload and depression/anxiety respectively, with the associations being much more potent for individuals with low levels of Confucian responsibility thinking. These findings have the potential to inform the development of prevention and intervention programs designed to reduce the negative emotions and cyber aggression associated with information overload in public health events.

AB Augmented reality (AR) can represent a contextualised scientific inquiry environment in which students may explore the real world and develop science process skills via interacting with rich information from virtual systems. However, it remains a challenge for most students to complete scientific inquiry tasks without proper support. Research evidence has suggested the potential of reflective scaffolding when applying scientific inquiry. Accordingly, we designed a contextualised reflective mechanism-based AR learning model to assist students in completing scientific inquiry tasks. Guided by the proposed model, we designed four stages of scientific inquiry learning: conceptual understanding, reflective cognition, in-depth inquiry, and knowledge building. A quasi-experiment and lag sequential analysis were conducted by recruiting 81 sixth-grade students to examine the effects of the proposed model on their scientific inquiry learning performances, higher order thinking, and behavioural patterns. The experimental results reveal that the proposed approach improved students' inquiry learning performances and higher order thinking tendency (problem-solving tendency and metacognitive awareness). Moreover, the evidence from this study also suggests that the students who learned with the proposed approach exhibited more observation, comparison, exploration, and reflection behavioural patterns in the field trip than those who learned without the contextualised reflective mechanism. Implications are discussed.

AB The proliferation of digital technologies sometimes referred to as the 'industrial or technological (digital) revolution' primarily affects the education sphere. The introduction of online learning technologies and the focus on independent and critical thinking actualizes the problem of developing these skills in future teachers and lawyers with the help of digital tools. The study looked at the critical thinking development in education while focusing on the use of digital tools in rational thinking formation in education. The research involved a random sample of under-graduate pedagogy students from [BLINDED] Institute of [BLINDED] University and graduate law students from [BLINDED] Institute. The digital tools were used to develop test tasks and logic problems, present information in graphical form, brainstorm, and collaborate in real-time to solve the created problems. The level of critical thinking development was assessed in dynamics using the method designed by Mishina based on the research Diane Halpern, Igor Zageshev, and Sergei Zair-Beck. The outcomes confirm the original hypothesis about the positive impact of digital tools on the formation of critical thinking in students.

AB This article proposes a speculation of the basic activity of the brain alluded to as the Data Elements of Thinking. This hypothesis is intended to be carried out computationally and afterward exposed to exact testing. It depends on Shannon's data hypothesis and treats the psyche/cerebrum as a data handling organ that intends to be data effective. This implies that it predicts its reality to utilize data proficiently and routinely re-addresses it to effectively store data. In other words, it tries to maximise its information efficiency. The theory is discussed within the framework of a background examination of a number of different research fields that had an influence on its evolution. The discussion then turns to the implications of the theory as well as the observable hypotheses that can be derived from it. Since the beginning of time, one of the fundamental concerns of philosophers has been the phenomena of art. This has been the case ever since the early periods. Along with how and under what conditions the process of creation is occurring and the reason why people require it, it is also the reason for people's sympathy and the meanings that are sent by the process. Persons who have been assigned to it, which usually manages to get people's attention. The focus of attention has also been brought to this phenomenon. of other philosophers who have come after Plato, and the philosophers themselves had also stated a variety of ideas regarding this subject.

AB Contribution: This document presents a systematic bibliographic review that demonstrates the need to conduct research on how the user experience impacts the development of computational thinking. Background: In the field of computer science, computational thinking is defined as a method that enhances problem-solving skills, system design, and human behavior understanding. Over the last few decades, several tools have been proposed for the development of computational thinking skills; however, there is no area of study that evaluates the implications or the impact that these types of platforms have on users belonging to any knowledge area. Research Question: Do user interfaces influence the development of computational thinking skills? Methodology: To address this issue, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology for analyzing and evaluating scientific publications. Findings: The results show that despite the dearth of literature on the subject, the specific design of a user interface has a significant impact on the development of computational thinking. Bearing the above in mind, it is necessary to conduct research that delves more deeply into the effects caused by the technologies that are used to develop computational thinking, this being a line of research that is worthy of consideration.

AB An increasing number of Chinese students are now studying abroad in western universities, and there is a widespread concern among western academics that Chinese students are not trained to have a critical mind. However, there is little empirical evidence so far as to whether this is actually the case. This paper presents the results of a systematic review of international studies that compare the critical thinking of Chinese students with students of other nationalities. A search of eight social science databases supplemented by other sources found 15 studies that met pre-specified inclusion criteria. Nine of these focused on students' critical thinking skills, but their results were mixed. There is no evidence to support the claim that Chinese students have higher or lower critical thinking skills than other students. The research in this area is weak. Five studies on critical thinking dispositions suggest that Chinese students were less disposed to critical thinking, which is not the same as being weak in critical thinking. Only one study was about critical thinking style, indicating that Chinese students perfer information-seeking to engaging in critical thinking. Almost all studies were small-scale using weak designs. These findings suggest that the critical thinking of Chinese students is under-studied, and therefore, more robust, larger-scale experimental studies are needed.

TI Retrieval Practices Enhance Computational and Scientific Thinking Skills

AB The notion of teaching experts' habits of mind (e.g., computational thinking and scientific thinking) to novices seems to have inspired many educators and researchers worldwide. In particular, a great deal of efforts has been invested in computational thinking (CT) and its manifestations in different fields. However, there remain some troubling spots in CT education as far as how to teach it at different levels of education. The same argument applies to teaching scientific thinking (ST) skills. A remedy has been suggested to narrow CT and ST skillsets down to core cognitive competencies so they can be introduced in early and middle grades and continue to be nurtured during secondary and post-secondary years. Neuroscientists suggest that the act of (computational) thinking is strongly linked to the acts of information storage/retrieval by our brain. Plus, years of research have shown that retrieval practices promote not only knowledge retention but also inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning. Not surprisingly, these reasoning skills are core elements of both CT and ST skillsets. This article will mesh the findings of a teacher professional development with the existing literature to lay a claim that retrieval practices enhance CT and ST skills. The study offered training to secondary school teachers (n = 275) who conducted classroom action research to measure the impact of retrieval practices on teaching and learning of STEM and CT concepts. We used a quasi-experimental research design with purposeful sampling and a sequential mixed-methods approach focusing on the impact of professional development on teacher outcomes and, in turn, on student outcomes. A survey of teacher participants showed that the majority (96%) of survey respondents (n = 232) reported a good understanding of retrieval strategies, and how relevant ideas can be implemented and tested in the classroom. A large number of action research (target-control) studies by teachers (n = 122) showed that students who learned STEM and CS concepts through retrieval practices consistently scored 5-30% higher than those using the usual blocked practice. In most cases, the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). While the study contributes to retrieval practices literature, those looking for best practices to teach core CT and ST skills should benefit from it the most. The study concludes with some recommendations for future research based on the limitations of its current findings.

AB Background: The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has led to a sudden change in education, closing schools and shifting to online teaching, which has become an enormous challenge for teachers and students. Implementing adequate online pedagogical approaches and integrating different digital tools in the teaching process have become a priority in educational systems. Finding a way to keep students' interest and persistence in learning is an important issue that online education is facing. One possible way to establish engaging and interactive learning environments, using the energy and enthusiasm of students for educational purposes, is the use of game-based learning activities and gamification of different parts of the educational process.
   Objective: This paper presents a use case of migrating an escape room-style educational game to an online environment by using the design thinking methodology. We wanted to show that the design thinking methodology is useful to create engaging and motivating online games that provide educational value.
   Methods: Starting from students' perspective, we created a simple digital escape room-style game where students got an opportunity to self-assess their knowledge in computer science at their own pace. Students tested this prototype game, and their opinions about the game were collected through an online survey. The test's goal was to evaluate the students' perceptions about the implemented digital escape room-style educational game and gather information about whether it could achieve students' engagement in learning computer science during online teaching.
   Results: In total, 117 students from sixth and seventh grades completed the survey regarding the achieved student engagement. Despite the differences in students' answers about game complexity and puzzle difficulty, most students liked the activity (mean 4.75, SD 0.67, on a scale from 1 to 5). They enjoyed the game, and they would like to participate in this kind of activity again (mean 4.74, SD 0.68). All (n=117, 100%) students found the digital escape room-style educational game interesting for playing and learning.
   Conclusions: The results confirmed that digital escape room-style games could be used as an educational tool to engage students in the learning process and achieve learning outcomes. Furthermore, the design thinking methodology proved to be a useful tool in the process of adding novel educational value to the digital escape room-style game.

AB In the post-truth era, one challenge facing science education is the circulation of fake news that distorts the information available for decision-making on issues that have a scientific basis and are controversial for society. In this work, we aimed at designing a learning environment with the objective of equipping students with skills that allow them to deal with socio-scientific issues (SSI) in an infodemic context. To this end, we proposed an educational innovation through design-based research, which was oriented to the treatment of information disseminated in the media and social networks related to COVID-19. We divided this information into four major constructs: virus and disease dynamics; pandemic and environmental crisis; hygiene and protocols; and vaccines, potential solutions, and pharmaceutical industry. On the basis of the activities of the didactic sequence, which included class discussion, interviews with the immediate environment, audiovisual productions, and a final plenary, we identified criteria that students applied to trust or not trust the circulating information and a series of strategies to corroborate the information. In addition, framing COVID-19 as an SSI allowed the discussion of curricular content in science and on sociocultural dimensions that cross the pandemic. Based on the implementation of the teaching-learning sequence, we conclude that the proposed activities favored reflection on critical thinking and awareness of the responsibilities they have as potential disseminators and/or generators of information.

AB Computational thinking (CT) skills are becoming increasingly relevant for future professionals across all domains, beyond computer science (CS). As such, an increasing number of bachelor's and master's programs outside of the CS discipline integrate CT courses within their study program. At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics. Our findings suggest that, in the process of learning CT for non-CS students, engagement in active learning activities can be a stronger determinant of learning outcomes than initial knowledge. Furthermore, gamifying computational notebooks can serve as a strong driver of active learning engagement, even more so than initial motivational factors.

AB The close relationship between the concepts of information systems and information technology creates issues for researchers. Usefully distinguishing between the concepts is problematic. We investigate the use of the systems concept in practice, finding a pragmatic distinction between an information system (IS) and an information technology system (IT system). In a practice view, an IS incorporates an emphasis on both a technical and a social subsystem, while an IT system predominantly emphasizes the technical elements. This distinction becomes useful in practice because contemporary IS practitioners are often involved in acquiring and integrating IT systems into an organizational IS. This involvement leads to a viewpoint on the organizational IS (including the social subsystem) as a nexus of multiple IT systems. This nexus creates issues in practice for not only integrating IT systems into the organizational IS, but also integrating multiple IT systems with each other in the context of the organizational IS. These issues lead to research opportunities such as the need for new methodologies for IT system acquisitions and new theories that accommodate the social integration of IT systems and IS.

AB Qualitative and quantitative research methods were undertaken to examine and develop a digitally based virtual classroom learning environment (VCLE) for Thai undergraduate students' creative thinking and innovation enhancement in science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEM/STEAM) disciplines. The research methodology was divided into two phases, including the synthesis and then the design of the VCLE. Also, in addition to the study's authors, nine experts were used for the model's development and another ten for its assessment (19 total). From their in-depth interviews and subsequent content analysis, their input of the proposed STEAM-ification process was synthesized and the data analyzed. The results revealed that the VCLE design should begin with a face-to-face, classroom learning environment in which the `gamification' mechanisms were introduced and examined. This was then reinforced by moving the gamification process online outside of the classroom. Furthermore, five VCLE STEAM-ification steps were found to be particularly useful for enhancing creative thinking and student innovation. These included investigation, discovery, connections, creativity, and reflection. Moreover, we identified the gamification process as consisting of three main components. These were the 'game mechanics,' the 'game dynamics,' and `player emotions'. The ten experts agreed that the VCLE STEAM-ification creativity and innovation (C & I) process was appropriate at an `excellent' level ((x) over bar = 4.68, S. D. = 0.47), which has great potential in the development of Thai undergraduate student C & I skills. Also, when undertaken correctly, innovation and motivation to learn are also outcomes from both VCLE and gamification applications. Thus, when students undertook study with the VCLE STEAM-ification format, they were found to achieve higher levels of creativity and innovation than students who studied using the traditional teaching plan. These results were found to be statistically significant at the .01 level.

AB The inclusion of ICT (TIC for the Spanish acronyms) in education has generated various challenges, among them the distorted imagery of what the virtual modality implies and means; the use of platforms and the appropriation of logistical, academic and administrative processes. In this context, various questions arise from students who think it is an imperative to provide clear answers timely. Even more so, when these students belong to the field of study of information and recognize that the transfer of information contributes to the optimization of communication processes, specifically in training environments. This is why this artide will report on a research experience whose main objective was to design a proposal for a virtual assistant that allowed solving the doubts of archival and library students in the virtual modality of the Inter-American School of Library Science -EIB- of the University of Antioquia, in order to optimize communication processes between students and those who coordinate the dynamics of virtuality in the institution. Such research process was based on the design thinking methodology that favored a state of empathy with the academic community which made it possible to identify the most recurrent concerns of students and their respective main thematic categories. In this sense, this was an initial exploratory and descriptive study that managed to obtain information which will serve as input for a next phase of development of a virtual assistant for the EIB.

AB Background: The perspective of patients and informal caregivers is often not expressed in conversations with healthcare professionals which can have a negative impact on quality of care and quality of life. Objective: Describe the development of a toolkit for patients with COPD or chronic heart failure and their informal caregivers enabling them to explore and express their perspective in conversations with healthcare professionals.Patient involvement: Patients, informal caregivers and healthcare professionals were involved in the design process from problem definition to solution development.Method: Design Thinking Approach using eight co-creation sessions and qualitative data-collection methods. Nineteen patients, ten informal caregivers and thirteen healthcare professionals participated in one or more co -creation sessions. Homogenous subgroups of participants were used in session 1, 2 and 4 and mixed groups were used in session 3, 5 and 6. Session 7 and 8 were used to test prototype toolkits.Results: Three challenges to expressing the personal perspective to healthcare professionals, four statements defining the desired situation for conversations, eleven design criteria for the toolkit and ten selection criteria for tools were identified. This information was used to develop a prototype toolkit.Discussion: Most patients and informal caregivers had moderate to high levels of education and all participating healthcare professionals were female with a majority of nurses and only three physicians. It is possible that this has influenced the design of the toolkit. Practical value: The toolkit can support patients and informal caregivers in exploring and expressing their perspective in conversations with healthcare professionals. Feasibility of the toolkit and implications for healthcare professionals will be examined in a pilot implementation study.

AB Given early childhood is a critical period for acquiring the twenty-first-century skills, the present study aimed to examine the effect of design-oriented STEM activities on the twenty-first-century skills of preschool children in line with the experimental design. A mixed factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) of 3 (time: pre-test, post-test and persistence) x 2 (experimental group and control group) was used to test the hypothesis. The Bayesian factor analysis for mixed data was performed to identify the effects of design-oriented STEM education on differences between groups as well as within the group. The study results indicated that design-oriented STEM activities permanently increased the total scores of the children in the experimental group as regards the twenty-first-century skills. It also appeared that design-oriented STEM activities permanently enhanced all sub-dimensions of life and career skills; learning and innovation skills; and information, media and technology skills. In the end, a number of recommendations were presented in accordance with the results of the study.

AB This research reviews 56 robots in science education (RSE) research articles published in SSCI (Social Sciences Citation Index) journals in the Web of Science (WoS) database. The analysis results showed that there were three clusters of RSE studies: robots in elementary science education, robot-based STEM activities, and robot-facilitated computational thinking. In terms of the research issues, more studies were conducted across-disciplines. Regarding thematic classifications, "general benefits of educational robots" was the most frequently investigated issue, while "diversity and broadening participation," and "creativity and motivation" were less frequently discussed. The most adopted research methods were quantitative and mixed methods, focusing on measuring learners' cognition and affect. Most of the interventions in the empirical studies adopted pedagogical interventions. In terms of the interaction issue, LEGO was adopted the most, followed by self-made robots; moreover, robots frequently played the role of tools in science education. From the perspective of specific robotics content knowledge, "control" (e.g. programming) comprised the majority. The most adopted learning strategy was project-based learning, followed by issue-based discussion. Regarding assessment issues, the most adopted evaluation approaches to evaluating students' performance were questionnaires, observation, verbal interviews, and artifacts to assess the quality of learning activities.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Due to the rapid growth of network technology, its openness and sharing capabilities and interaction have helped change the art education model for the better. Increased science has been presented to students who spend a lot of time utilizing technology. They similarly did greater mathematical abilities. IT has a good effect on student learning must be included in classroom education. Art education must shift from a teacher-centred to a student-centred approach, and students' passive reception of knowledge must be altered. Students' academic enthusiasm and awareness must be fostered, and their ability to locate knowledge resources must be enhanced. Using pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) in visual art education as a benchmark and this study examines art teachers' PCK proficiency in this area. Social learning theory is applied in the art education curriculum through observational learning based on the Artificial Intelligence-based Creative Thinking Skills Analysis Model (AI-CTSAM). An analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and a grey clustering-based performance analysis model are established to enhance AI's effectiveness in art instruction. Most of the methods to assess clustering performance exist in two types in which one is irrelevant actions requiring labels of foundation truth. Examples are Adjusted Rand, Fowlkes-Mallows, Mutual information scores, Homogeneity, Completeness, and V measurements. Model-based cluster analysis is a new classification approach for investigating population heterogeneity utilizing a limited multivariate mixture. Students can describe, analyze, interpret, and evaluate artwork through the visual art education curriculum.

AB The first half of this article offers two possibilities of how the argument Kojonen makes might be vulnerable to other new developments in evolutionary science and psychology-potential broadsides that might threaten to sink the salvaged ship of design once again. Work on the development of life suggests that life is a simplification of surrounding environmental information, and therefore life does not generate new information. Second, the psychology of pareidolia suggests we find design as a bias of our information processing, rather than observing something that exists. The second half of the article offers a critique of how the metaphors we use to describe God and the world shape our approaches to solving theological and philosophical questions (particularly theodicy). I offer some organic metaphors in place of the usual mechanistic metaphors to think about how the design argument could be reformulated.

AB In this article, researchers conducted a study that integrates Augmented Reality application with Computational Thinking into Geometry Topics. Three variables were measured, Computational Thinking, Visualisation Skills and Geometry Topic achievement. The study was implemented with 124 students in two different schools using quasi-experimental study design. The t-test analysis was performed to see the differences before and after the intervention between the control and treatment groups. Next, a MANCOVA was conducted to see the effectiveness of the intervention in more depth on Computational Thinking, Visualisation Skills and Geometry Topic achievement after controlling for existing knowledge factors. The results show that there is a positive effect of teaching methods using Augmented Reality applications with Computational Thinking for students in the improvement of Computational Thinking, Visualisation Skills and Geometry Topic achievement. Moreover, the results of the MANCOVA show that overall, teaching methods using Augmented Reality applications with Computational Thinking are factors in the improvement of Computational Thinking scores, Visualisation Skills and Geometry Topic achievement, which means the students' existing knowledge did not affect the results of the three dependent variables. In conclusion, this study proposed that the Computational Thinking approach with Augmented Reality application can improve Computational Thinking, Visualisation Skills and Geometry Topic achievement among students.

AB People often search for information in order to learn something new. In recent years, the "search-as-learning"movement has argued that search systems should be better designed to support learning. Current search systems (especially Web search engines) are largely designed and optimized to fulfill simple look-up tasks (e.g., navigational or fact-finding search tasks). However, they provide less support for searchers working on complex tasks that involve learning. Search-as-learning studies have investigated a wide range of research questions. For example, studies have aimed to better understand how characteristics of the individual searcher, the type of search task, and interactive features provided by the system can influence learning outcomes. Learning assessment is a key component in search-as-learning studies. Assessment materials are used to both gauge prior knowledge and measure learning during or after one or more search sessions. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of different types of assessments used in search-as-learning studies to date. The paper makes the following three contributions. First, we review different types of assessments used and discuss their potential benefits and drawbacks. Second, we review assessments used outside of search-as learning, which may provide insights and opportunities for future research. Third, we provide recommendations for future research. Importantly, we argue that future studies should clearly define learning objectives and develop assessment materials that reliably capture the intended type of learning. For example, assessment materials should test a participant's ability to engage with specific cognitive processes, which may range from simple (e.g., memorization) to more complex (e.g., critical and creative thinking). Additionally, we argue that future studies should consider two dimensions that are understudied in search-as-learning: long-term retention (i.e., being able to use what was learned in the long term) and transfer of learning (i.e., being able to use what was learned in a novel context).

AB Conceptual design is a pivotal stage of new product development in manufacturing industries. Since multiple design alternatives are put forward at this stage, developing advanced evaluation methods is of great importance. Existing methods adopt additive models to integrate evaluation data. They face some inconsistency issues, e.g. inconsistency in the independent assumption and interdependent data, since evaluation criteria are interactional. Fuzzy measure that replaces the additivity with monotonicity has enabled advances in addressing such issues. This work proposes a two-additive fuzzy measure-based information integration approach to product design alternative evaluation for the first time. The evaluation data given by experts are in the form of intuitionistic linguistic numbers. They are more in accordance with the thinking habits of experts because the hesitation degree in linguistic assessment can be revealed. In order to reduce the subjective bias, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method combining with grey relational analysis is applied to adjust evaluation data. Then monotonous two-additive fuzzy measure is identified by nonlinear programming using these data. It makes a good trade-off between computational complexity and presentation capability. Hence, evaluation data can be integrated by non-additive Choquet integral for ranking design alternatives. In comparison to additive model based methods, the extra effect on the simultaneous satisfaction of criteria can be effectively revealed by the proposed approach. And the robustness of it is demonstrated by the sensitivity analysis. A case study on an elevator's design alternative evaluation is conducted to illustrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed approach.

AB Cluster randomized trials are frequently used in educational research for methodological reasons. This study aims to improve the efficiency of cluster randomized trials on computer/information literacy and computational thinking. The study employs a two-level hierarchical linear model to estimate (i) intraclass correlation coefficients, (ii) the amount of explained variances given selected predictors, and (iii) minimum detectable effect sizes given the set of plausible scenarios. Two data cycles from the International Computer and Information Study were used. The covariates at the student level are gender, interest in ICT, parents' highest education level, ICT self-efficacy, and experience with computers. The covariates at school/teacher level are teacher's ICT use, ratio of school size to the number of computers for student use, availability of ICT resources at school, approximate teacher age, and ICT self-efficacy. Findings showed that the most precise effect could be measured when student and teacher/school covariates are both adopted. Lastly, it was revealed that increasing the number of schools is effective to get the most precise effect.

AB This study aims to explore what determinants affect learners' intention to continue using virtual reality (VR) for learning in formal classroom settings. In the proposed theoretical framework, three eudaemonic factors, namely perceived utility, curiosity, and superior influence, were adapted as external stimuli. Moreover, individuals' cognitive absorption and reflective thinking were set as mediators, while the traits of openness and digital literacy were set as moderators. A total of 463 school students (grades 9/10, M = 284, F = 179) participated in the designed experiment based on a personal computer-based immersive environment. Then, the students were asked to complete a perceived utility scale, superior influence scale, curiosity and cognitive ab-sorption scale, reflective thinking scale, digital literacy and trait of openness scale. The results demonstrated that eudaemonic factors positively influence students' cognition (cognitive ab-sorption and reflective thinking) and learners' intention to continue to use VR for learning. Notably, individuals' digital literacy and openness traits significantly moderate personal reflec-tive thinking in an immersive environment. In this study, we illustrated the conceptual view of learners' intention to continue using VR for learning, which has theoretical and practical impli-cations for educators, researchers, and policy-makers.
