QTL mapping of inbreeding-related cold sensitivity and conditional lethality in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						age-specific mortality; cold-sensitive lethals; composite interval mapping; dominance ratio; epistasis; G x E interaction	QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; ELITE RICE HYBRID; GENETIC-BASIS; HETEROSIS; DEPRESSION; EXPRESSION; DOMINANCE; EXTINCTION; DEPENDENCE; RESISTANCE	Inbreeding depression is a central theme within genetics, and is of specific interest for researchers within evolutionary and conservation genetics and animal and plant breeding. Inbreeding effects are thought to be caused by the joint expression of conditional and unconditional deleterious alleles. Whenever the expression of deleterious alleles is conditional, this can result in extreme environmental sensitivity in certain inbred lineages. Analysis of conditional lethal effects can reveal some of the loci that are sensitive to inbreeding. We performed a QTL (quantitative trait locus) mapping study of inbreeding-related and conditionally expressed lethality in Drosophila melanogaster. The lethal effect was triggered by exposure to a cold shock. We used a North Carolina crossing Design 3 to establish the mapping population, as well as to estimate the average dominance ratio and heritability. We found two QTL on the major autosomes carrying recessive lethals that caused male mortality, one of which also affected female mortality. More detailed study of these loci will provide information on the mechanistic basis and environmental sensitivity of inbreeding depression.	[Vermeulen, C.

But what motivates individuals when they make collective decisions? While it is a popular belief that individual incentives promote out-of-thebox thinking and diverse solutions, the exact role of motivation and reward in collective intelligence remains unclear. Here we examined collective intelligence in an interactive group estimation task where participants were rewarded for their individual or group's performance. In addition to examining individual versus collective incentive structures, we controlled whether participants could see social information about the others' responses. We found that knowledge about others' responses reduced the wisdom of the crowd and, crucially, this effect depended on how people were rewarded. When rewarded for the accuracy of their individual responses, participants converged to the group mean, increasing social conformity, reducing diversity and thereby diminishing their group wisdom. When rewarded for their collective performance, diversity of opinions and the group wisdom increased. We conclude that the intuitive association between individual incentives and individualist opinion needs revising.

In view of the increasing significance of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction required by various countries, heritage buildings serve an important target in mitigating energy consumption through refurbishment. Information on the performance assessment of heritage buildings during refurbishment is rare in current literature. Hence, the aim of this study is to explore possible applicable assessment themes for heritage building refurbishment. A literature review was conducted from various assessment tools to develop a generic assessment framework. Four focus group discussions with 32 research and industry experts were carried out, and the applicable assessment themes and sub-themes were determined. Five main assessment dimensions relevant to heritage buildings refurbishment was identified-heritage, environmental, economic, social, and process. However, the process dimension was found to be unaddressed by currently assessment tools. This research can facilitate the identification of appropriate assessment themes and sub-themes for the refurbishment and improvement of heritage buildings. The findings can also be used by policy makers, conservators, designers, and building owners when refurbishing heritage buildings.

This notion is supported by experimental evidence that bidding is closer to dominance in the dynamic ascending-clock auction than the static second-price auction (private values), noting that dominance is theoretically obvious in the former but not the latter. We replicate his experimental study and add three intermediate auction formats that decompose the designs' differences to quantify the cumulative effects of (1) simply seeing an ascending-price clock (after bid submission), (2) bidding dynamically on the clock, and (3) getting (theoretically irrelevant) drop-out information about other bidders. The theory predicts dominance to become obvious through (2), dynamic bidding. We find no significant behavioral effect of (2), however, while the feedback effects (1) and (3) are highly significant. We conclude that behavioral differences between second-price and ascending-clock auctions offer rather limited support for the theory of obviousness and that framing has surprisingly large potential in mechanism design.

Hypotheses from research on regulatory fit theory are evaluated in this study. A 2x2 design combines pre-negotiation other-affirmation (as explicit or implicit) and mediator approach (as directive or facilitative). In support of the fit hypothesis, we showed that the implicit-directive combination produced the best joint outcomes. Directional findings showed that the fit between explicit affirmation and facilitative mediation also produced favorable outcomes. Uncertainty reduction was posited as a plausible explanation for these findings. Implications are suggested for interventions intended to resolve conflicts over resources derived from values.

Yet, in mammalian embryos, concentrations change rapidly compared to the time for making cell fate decisions. Here, we use human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to address how changing morphogen levels influence differentiation, focusing on how BMP4 and Nodal signaling govern the cell-fate decisions associated with gastrulation. We show that BMP4 response is concentration dependent, but that expression of many Nodal targets depends on rate of concentration change. Moreover, in a self-organized stem cell model for human gastrulation, expression of these genes follows rapid changes in endogenous Nodal signaling. Our study shows a striking contrast between the specific ways ligand dynamics are interpreted by two closely related signaling pathways, highlighting both the subtlety and importance of morphogen dynamics for understanding mammalian embryogenesis and designing optimized protocols for directed stem cell differentiation.

Survey data were collected from 1716 residents of coastal areas of the USA affected by Hurricane Sandy. Respondents were randomly assigned to receive a combination of textual messages about a hypothetical approaching hurricane, including hazard-based, impact-based, and fear-based messages. The analysis examines how the experimental messages influenced respondents' evacuation intentions, risk perceptions, efficacy beliefs, and perceptions of the information and its source. The influence of non-message factors, including respondents' actual and perceived geographical exposure to hurricane-related risks, evacuation planning, and hurricane-related experiences, is also investigated. The results indicate that the high-impact and fear messages increased evacuation intentions, risk perceptions, and response efficacy, but the effects were small. The hazard message manipulations did not significantly influence most of the dependent variables examined; in particular, neither of the two storm surge messages tested increased evacuation intentions or risk perceptions relative to the wind-only or flood message. There were also no significant differences in message effects among respondents who lived or thought they lived in areas at higher risk. Further, several individual difference variables examined influenced evacuation intentions more than the message variations. Overall, experience evacuating for Sandy was the strongest predictor of evacuation intentions. These results indicate the importance of designing and evaluating hazard risk communications in the context of the other messages people are receiving and the individual differences that influence protective decision making.

In a prospective, within-subjects, repeated-measures study of 66 subjects with episodic migraine, we investigated how variations in medication labeling modified placebo and drug effects. An initial attack with no treatment served as a control. In six subsequent migraine attacks, each participant received either placebo or Maxalt (10-mg rizatriptan) administered under three information conditions ranging from negative to neutral to positive (told placebo, told Maxalt or placebo, told Maxalt) (N = 459 documented attacks). Treatment order was randomized. Maxalt was superior to placebo for pain relief. When participants were given placebo labeled as (i) placebo, (ii) Maxalt or placebo, and (iii) Maxalt, the placebo effect increased progressively. Maxalt had a similar progressive boost when labeled with these three labels. The efficacies of Maxalt labeled as placebo and placebo labeled as Maxalt were similar. The efficacy of open-label placebo was superior to that of no treatment. Relative to no treatment, the placebo, under each information condition, accounted for more than 50% of the drug effect. Increasing "positive" information incrementally boosted the efficacy of both placebo and medication during migraine attacks. The benefits of placebo persisted even if placebo was honestly described. Whether treatment involves medication or placebo, the information provided to patients and the ritual of pill taking are important components of care.

Transport and Fate of Methyl Iodide and Its Pest Control in Soils	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							BROMIDE EMISSIONS; COVERED FIELD; DEGRADATION; FUMIGANT; 1,3-DICHLOROPROPENE; VOLATILIZATION; CHLOROPICRIN; EFFICACY; DRIP	For fumigants, information on transport and fate as well as pest control is needed to develop management practices with the fewest negative environmental effects while offering sufficient pest control efficacy. For this purpose, a 2-D soil chamber with a surface-mounted flux chamber was designed to determine volatilization, real-time soil gas-phase concentration, degradation, and organism survivability after methyl iodide (Mel) fumigation Three types of pests were used to give a broad spectrum of pest control information. An infected sandy loam soil with a volumetric water content of 10 6% was packed carefully into the 2-D chamber to a bulk density of 1.34 g cm(-3). After Mel fumigation at a rate of 56.4 kg ha(-1) for 24 h, about 28.9% of Mel was emitted into air, 6 8% remained in the soil, and 43 6% degraded in the soil (based on the residual iodide concentration) The uncertainty in the measured Mel degradation using iodide concentration was thought to mainly contribute to the unrecovered Mel (about 20%) The citrus nematodes [Tylenchulus semipenetrans] were effectively eliminated even at low concentration-time (CT) values (< 30 mu g h mL(-1)), but all Fusarium oxysporum survived The response of barnyardgrass seeds [Echinochloa crus-galli] spatially varied with the CT values in the chamber. To fully control barnyardgrass seeds, CT of greater than 300 mu g h mL(-1) was required. Using this experimental approach, different fumigant emission reduction strategies can be tested, and mathematical models can be verified to determine which strategies produce the least emission to the atmosphere while maintaining sufficient pest control efficacy.

Stressed Memories: How Acute Stress Affects Memory Formation in Humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; LOCUS-COERULEUS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; EMOTIONAL AROUSAL; SPATIAL MEMORY; ACTIVATION; HIPPOCAMPUS; SYSTEM	Stressful, aversive events are extremely well remembered. Such a declarative memory enhancement is evidently beneficial for survival, but the same mechanism may become maladaptive and culminate in mental diseases such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Stress hormones are known to enhance postlearning consolidation of aversive memories but are also thought to have immediate effects on attentional, sensory, and mnemonic processes at memory formation. Despite their significance for our understanding of the etiology of stress-related mental disorders, effects of acute stress at memory formation, and their brain correlates at the system scale, remain elusive. Using an integrated experimental approach, we probed the neural correlates of memory formation while participants underwent a controlled stress induction procedure in a crossover design. Physiological (cortisol level, heart rate, and pupil dilation) and subjective measures confirmed acute stress. Remarkably, reduced hippocampal activation during encoding predicted stress-enhanced memory performance, both within and between participants. Stress, moreover, amplified early visual and inferior temporal responses, suggesting that hypervigilant processing goes along with enhanced inferior temporal information reduction to relay a higher proportion of task-relevant information to the hippocampus. Thus, acute stress affects neural correlates of memory formation in an unexpected manner, the understanding of which may elucidate mechanisms underlying psychological trauma etiology.

Tendon overload results in alterations in cell shape and increased markers of inflammation and matrix degradation	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS			English	Article						Tendinopathy; metabolism; tenocyte; fatigue; microdamage; collagen; fascicle; interfascicular matrix	MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; GENE-EXPRESSION; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ENERGY-STORAGE; IN-VIVO; INTERLEUKIN-6; COLLAGEN; IL-1-BETA; FASCICLES; TISSUE	Tendon injury is thought to involve both damage accumulation within the matrix and an accompanying cell response. While several studies have characterized cell and matrix response in chronically injured tendons, few have assessed the initial response of tendon to overload-induced damage. In this study, we assessed cell response to cyclic loading. Fascicle bundles from the equine superficial digital flexor tendon were exposed to cyclic loading in vitro, designed to mimic a bout of high-intensity exercise. Changes in cell morphology and protein-level alterations in markers of matrix inflammation and degradation were investigated. Loading resulted in matrix damage, which was accompanied by cells becoming rounder. The inflammatory markers cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin-6 were increased in loaded samples, as were matrix metalloproteinase-13 and the collagen degradation marker C1,2C. These results indicate upregulation of inflammatory and degradative pathways in response to overload-induced in vitro, which may be initiated by alterations in cell strain environment because of localized matrix damage. This provides important information regarding the initiation of tendinopathy, suggesting that inflammation may play an important role in the initial cell response to tendon damage. Full understanding of the early tenocyte response to matrix damage is critical in order to develop effective treatments for tendinopathy.	[Thorpe, C. T.; Chaudhry, S.; Lei, I.

Thin-film magnetic insulators have been identified as promising materials for spin-current technology because they are thought to exhibit lower damping compared with their metallic counterparts. However, insulating behavior is not a sufficient requirement for low damping, as evidenced by the very limited options for low-damping insulators. Here, we demonstrate a new class of nanometer-thick ultralow-damping insulating thin films based on design criteria that minimize orbital angular momentum and structural disorder. Specifically, we show ultralow damping in <20 nm thick spinel-structure magnesium aluminum ferrite (MAFO), in which magnetization arises from Fe3+ ions with zero orbital angular momentum. These epitaxial MAFO thin films exhibit a Gilbert damping parameter of similar to 0.0015 and negligible inhomogeneous linewidth broadening, resulting in narrow half width at half maximum linewidths of similar to 0.6 mT around 10 GHz. Our findings offer an attractive thin-film platform for enabling integrated insulating spintronics.

J	Melucci, M				Melucci, Massimo			Contextual Search: A Computational Framework	FOUNDATIONS AND TRENDS IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Article							INFORMATION-SEEKING CONTEXT; SEARCH ENGINE; WEB; RETRIEVAL; RELEVANCE; FRAMEWORK; THINKING; CAPTURE; SCIENCE; NOTION	The growing availability of data in electronic form, the expansion of the World Wide Web (WWW) and the accessibility of computational methods for large-scale data processing have allowed researchers in Information Retrieval (IR) to design systems which can effectively and efficiently constrain search within the boundaries given by context, thus transforming classical search into contextual search. Because of the constraints imposed by context, contextual search better focuses on the users relevance and improves retrieval performance, since the out-of-context aspects of the search carried out by users that are likely linked to irrelevant documents are left apart. This survey introduces contextual search within a computational framework based on contextual variables, contextual factors and statistical models. The framework adopted in this survey considers the data observable from the real world entities participating in contextual search and classifies them as what we call contextual variables. The contextual variables considered are content, geotemporal, interaction, and social variables. Moreover, we distinguish between contextual variables and contextual factor : the former is what can be observed, the latter is what cannot be observed, yet this is the factor affecting the users relevance assessment. Therefore, in this survey, we describe how statistical models can process contextual variables to infer the contextual factors underlying the current search context. In this survey we provide a background to the subject by : placing it among other surveys on relevance, interaction, context, and behavior; providing the description of the contextual variables used for implementing the statistical models which represent and predict relevance and contextual factors; citing and surveying useful publications to the reader for further examination; providing an overview of the evaluation methodologies and findings relevant to this subject; and briefly describing some implementations of contextual search tools.

J	Kwofie, TE; Aigbavboa, CO; Machethe, SO				Kwofie, Titus Ebenezer; Aigbavboa, Clinton Ohis; Machethe, Seja Olgah			Nature of communication performance in non-traditional procurements in South Africa	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Interpersonal communication; Communication performance; Non-traditional procurement	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; COLLABORATIVE WORKING; DESIGN; IMPACT; SELECTION; COMPETENCES; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; NETWORK; SYSTEM	Purpose Non-traditional procurement is thought to offer enhanced benefits over traditional contracts. However, several factors significantly impacting the optimization of the benefits have been suggested. Even though effective communication is ranked high among these factors, not enough empirical insights have been given to the nature of communication performance in non-traditional procurements in construction project delivery. The purpose of this paper is to focus on understanding the taxonomy of communication performance in non-traditional procurements in the South African Construction Industry, given the centrality of communication to team effectiveness, performance, project success and managerial efficiency. Design/methodology/approach Adopting a deductive research approach, an empirical questionnaire survey was conducted drawing on the practical communication experience of project teams engaged in projects using non-traditional procurement systems. Findings Using aggregated mean scores and inter-rater agreement index and Mann-Whitney tests, the results revealed inaccuracies, barriers and procedural challenges as frequently occurring in the interpersonal and organizational communication in the adopted non-traditional procurement systems. Additionally, untimeliness and distorted information were noted to be occurring occasionally, whereas incomplete communication, misunderstood information and gatekeeping rarely occurred. Lastly, protocol-related communication challenges were deemed to have never occurred in their interpersonal and organizational communication in their project delivery. In the assessment of communication performance, the less frequently occurring assessment indicator is a testament to good communication performance, whereas the frequently occurring indicator represents a poor performance in the communication. Originality/value This systematic approach toward understanding the taxonomy of the interpersonal and organizational communication performance in non-traditional procurement is very significant toward communication performance improvement in the industry. The insight given by the findings may help construction project practitioners to focus their attention on the necessary aspects of communication in non-traditional procurements to optimize their benefits over traditional procurement models.

This paper proposed a framework that integrates Building Information Modeling (BIM) with LSSVM (least square support vector machine (LSSVM) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to study the influence of building envelope parameters on building energy consumption and discover the best design. The DesignBuilder (DB) is used to perform energy consumption simulation and orthogonal experiment to obtain the sample data set. The LSSVM is utilized to learn the data set to establish a prediction model between the building envelope and energy consumption, which is used as the fitness function of the building energy consumption in NSGA-II. With the objective of minimizing building energy consumption and maximizing the indoor thermal comfort (measured by predicted mean vote or PMV), an NSGA-II multi-objective optimization model is established. The Pareto front is obtained through calculation, and the optimal combination of building envelope parameters is discovered using the ideal point method. A case of a proposed school building in China is used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed framework, the results show that: (1) The LSSVM has great ability to predict building energy consumption, achieving an accurate prediction with a goodness-of -fit of 0.9549 and an RMSE of 0.0273; (2) The optimized envelope design parameters of the proposed building are presented, including the External wall U-value is 0.2, the External wall solar absorptance is 0.55, the Roof U-value is 0.2, the External window U-value is 0.4166, the External window U-value is 1, the Window wall ratio is 0.215. (3) The developed LSSVM-NSGA II hybrid approach can effectively improve the building's energy consumption and thermal comfort with the building energy consumption reduced by 10.6% and the thermal comfort increased by 32.2% than the initial values, respectively. The proposed LSSVM-NSGA II framework is able to optimize building envelope design parameters than its precedent, which can provide effective thinking for similar problems.

Combining deliberation and intuition in patient decision support	PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING			English	Article						Patient decision aids (DAs); Values clarification methods (VCMs); Preference construction; Decision making; Intuition; Deliberation	UNCONSCIOUS THOUGHT; METACOGNITIVE DIFFICULTY; THINKING TOO; PREFERENCES; CHOICE; AIDS; INFORMATION; JUDGMENT; BEHAVIOR; QUALITY	Objective: To review the strengths and weaknesses of deliberative and intuitive processes in the context of patient decision support and to discuss implications for decision aid (DA) design. Methods: Conceptual review of the strengths and weaknesses of intuitive and analytical decision making and applying these findings to the practice of DA design. Results: DAs combine several important goals: providing information, helping to clarify treatment related values, supporting preference construction processes, and facilitating more active engagement in decision making. Many DAs encourage patients to approach a decision analytically, without solid theoretical or empirical grounding for this approach. Existing research in other domains suggests that both intuition and deliberation may support decision making. We discuss implications for patient decision support and challenge researchers to determine when combining these processes leads to better outcomes. Conclusions: Intuitive and analytical decision processes may have complementary effects in achieving the desired outcomes of patient decision support. Practice implications: DA developers should be aware that tools solely targeted at supporting deliberation may limit DA effectiveness and harm preference construction processes. Patients may be better served by combined strategies that draw on the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of both deliberative and intuitive processes. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Lee, DW; Hwang, I				Lee, Dong Wook; Hwang, Inhwan			Understanding the evolution of endosymbiotic organelles based on the targeting sequences of organellar proteins	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Review						chloroplast; endosymbiosis; evolution of signal sequences; mitochondria; presequence; protein targeting mechanisms; transit peptide		Organellogenesis, a key aspect of eukaryotic cell evolution, critically depends on the successful establishment of organellar protein import mechanisms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the evolution of the two endosymbiotic organelles, the mitochondrion and the chloroplast, is thought to have occurred at time periods far from each other. Despite this, chloroplasts and mitochondria have highly similar protein import mechanisms. This raises intriguing questions such as what underlies such similarity in the import mechanisms and how these similar mechanisms have evolved. In this review, we summarise the recent findings regarding sorting and specific targeting of these organellar proteins. Based on these findings, we propose possible evolutionary scenarios regarding how the signal sequences of chloroplasts and mitochondrial proteins ended up having such relationship.

It is of particular use when the binding site is known and is thought to be applicable to structure-based drug design (SBDD) and educating students about biomolecular interactions. For SBDD, it enables expertise and intuition to be brought to bear in the drug design process. In education, it can teach students about the most basic level of biomolecular function. Here, we introduce DockIT for virtual reality (VR) that uses a VR headset and hand-held controllers. Using the method of linear response on explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations, DockIT can model both global and local conformational changes within the receptor due to forces of interaction with the ligand. It has real-time flexible molecular surface rendering and can show the real-time formation and breaking of hydrogen bonds, both between the ligand and receptor and within the receptor itself as it smoothly changes conformation.

J	OBRIEN, KF				OBRIEN, KF			CONCERNING THE ANALYSIS OF 2X2-TABLES	COMPUTERS AND BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article							CONTINGENCY TABLE; BINOMIAL PROPORTIONS; TESTS; POWER	Recent papers (R. M. Engeman and G. D. Swanson, 1991, Comput. Biomed. Res. 24, 509; M. R. Massai and P. Barbini, 1993, Comput. Biomed Res. 26, 98) have expressed concern regarding differences in results among statistical methods of hypothesis testing for 2 x 2 contingency tables. These papers did not present current statistical thought on this topic, and they did not discuss measures of effect for such analyses. In this paper statistical literature on the 2 x 2 contingency table is presented and philosophical issues underlying the methods discussed. Measures of effect appropriate for several data origins or designs which result in 2 x 2 arrays are also presented. The paper presents an empirical adjustment to the Fisher's exact test known as the mid-P approach. The information should help provide the user of statistics a better understanding of the analysis of 2 x 2 tables. An example using data from Engeman and Swanson (1991) is provided, and some recommendations for the analysis of 2 x 2 tables are given. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.

J	Nieves, JC; Lindgren, H; Cortés, U				Nieves, Juan Carlos; Lindgren, Helena; Cortes, Ulises			Agent-Based Reasoning in Medical Planning and Diagnosis Combining Multiple Strategies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						Medical diagnosis; decision making; knowledge representation and reasoning	CLINICAL GUIDELINES; LOGIC; KNOWLEDGE; DEMENTIA	Medical reasoning describes a form of qualitative inquiry that examines the cognitive (thought) processes involved in making medical decision. In this field the goal for diagnostic reasoning is assessing causes of observed conditions in order to make informed choices about treatment. In order to design a diagnostic reasoning method we merge ideas from a hypothetic-deductive method and the Domino model. In this setting, we introduce the so called Hypothetic-Deductive-Domino (HD-D) algorithm. In addition, a multi-agent approach is presented, which takes advantage of the HD-D algorithm for illuminating different standpoints in a diagnostic reasoning and assessment process, and for reaching a well-founded conclusion. This multi-agent approach is based on the so called Observer and Validating agents. The Observer agents are supported by a deductive inference process and the Validating agents are supported by an abductive inference process. The knowledge bases of these agents are captured by a class of possibilistic logic programs. Hence, these agents are able to deal with qualitative information. The approach is illustrated by a real scenario from diagnosing dementia diseases.

J	Yang, C; Li, J; Sheng, M; Liu, Q				Yang, C.; Li, J.; Sheng, M.; Liu, Q.			Green heterogeneous networks: a cognitive radio idea	IET COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article								From an energy-saving perspective, the authors investigate the downlink power control issue of the two-tier heterogeneous networks (HetNets) using a cognitive radio train of thought. The authors consider the HetNets scenario of one macro-cell evolved-NodeB (eNB) and multiple femto-cell Home evolved NodeBs (HeNBs) cooperatively coexisting to provide better services. A specific HeNB allows macro-mobile station (macro-MS) previously associated with eNB to access to it for better signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) guarantee. As a reward, the macro-MS pays a certain of revenue to HeNB as the incentive mechanism for this HeNB's downlink extra power consumption, which is manifested in the design of the price function. The throughput bound of Macro-MSs in HeNB cell is given. Then, the authors select the SINR as the performance measure and formulate the power control of selected HeNBs as multi-constrained optimisation problem. Meanwhile, the authors derive the sub-optimal and closed-form power control of individual HeNB, based on which the authors design the distributed algorithm with the aid of eNB and HeNBs cooperatively to implement the pricing information exchange. Simulation results show the improved performance of the convergence, the energy-efficiency measured by 'energy-per-bit' and the throughput of the 'Proposed-Cognitive-x' power control algorithm.

It does not attempt to review the field in an objective manner but summarises the particular viewpoint of the author by reviewing selected co-operative projects. Starting briefly with the author's final year thesis, the paper touches on projects for Cedric Price and Waiter Segal with contrasting ideas about co-operation, The paper then expands on the concept of co-evolutionary theory including the co-operative evolution of buildings with each other, with the environment and with the inhabitants. It concentrates On the most recent co-evolutionary projects for buildings and cities.

J	Garulli, A; Paoletti, S; Vicino, A				Garulli, Andrea; Paoletti, Simone; Vicino, Antonio			Models and Techniques for Electric Load Forecasting in the Presence of Demand Response	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Artificial neural networks (ANNs); demand response; electric load forecasting; exponential smoothing (ES); support vector machines (SVMs); transfer function (TF) models		Demand-side management has been recently recognized as a strategic concept in smart electricity grids. In this context, active demand (AD) represents a demand response scenario in which households and small commercial consumers participate in grid management through appropriate modifications of their consumption patterns during certain time periods in return of a monetary reward. The participation is mediated by a new player, called aggregator, who designs the consumption pattern modifications to make up standardized products to be sold on the energy market. The presence of this new input to consumers generated by aggregators modifies the load behavior, asking for load forecasting algorithms that explicitly consider the AD effect. In this paper, we propose an approach to load forecasting in the presence of AD, based on gray-box models where the seasonal component of the load is extracted by a suitable preprocessing and AD is considered as an exogenous input to a linear transfer function model. The approach is thought for a distribution system operator that performs technical validation of AD products, and therefore possesses full information about the AD schedule in the network. A comparison of the performance of the proposed approach with techniques not using the information on AD and with approaches based on nonlinear black-box models is performed on a real load time series recorded in an area of the Italian low voltage network.

However, the traditional logic abstractions and the digital design patterns we understand so well have coevolved with the hardware technology that has embodied them. As we look past CMOS, there is no reason to think that those same abstractions best serve to encapsulate the computational potential inherent to emerging devices. We posit that a new and radically more efficient foundation for computing lies at the intersection of superconductor electronics and delay-coded computation. Building on recent work in race logic, we show that superconducting circuits can naturally compute directly over temporal relationships between pulse arrivals; that the computational relationships between those pulse arrivals can be formalized through a functional extension to a temporal predicate logic used in the verification community; and that the resulting architectures can operate asynchronously and describe real and useful computations. We verify our hypothesis through a combination of detailed analog circuit models and layout designs, a formal analysis of our abstractions, and an evaluation of several superconducting temporal accelerators.

J	Brudzinski, MR; Jaeger, A; Shipley, TF				Brudzinski, Michael R.; Jaeger, Allison; Shipley, Thomas F.			Challenges in Making Meaning from Ground-Motion Visualizations: The Role of Geoscience Knowledge in Interpreting Dynamic Spatiotemporal Patterns	SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							SEDUCTIVE DETAILS; ANIMATION; SCIENCE; PERFORMANCE; CONSTRAINTS; INFORMATION; THINKING; RECALL; MEMORY	The USArray ground-motion visualization (GMV) is an Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) video product that illustrates how seismic waves travel away from an earthquake by depicting seismometers as symbols that vary in color according to the recorded amplitudes. GMVs are typically the most popular product the IRIS produces following an earthquake (e.g., similar to 10, 000 unique views for a recent Oklahoma earthquake). Many instructors feel that dynamic visualizations offer learning advantages over static media when demonstrating dynamic processes, but research indicated they can impede learning by placing greater information processing requirements on the learner. We sought to evaluate changes in student understanding of seismic waves from GMVs by collecting data from three different college-level settings: general student population in a psychology laboratory (novices), students in middle- and upper-level geoscience courses (geoscience majors), and a seismology research group. A seven-question multiple-choice assessment was developed for use in all three settings and then administered in the laboratory and classroom. Using a similar question before and after the GMV viewing, we found that most geoscience majors understood seismic-wave concepts prior to the GMV and the GMV improved their understanding. Only about half of the novices appeared to understand seismic-wave concepts prior to the GMV and performance decreased after the GMV. Performance decreases were larger when students watched an alternative tutorial GMV developed to further illustrate what a GMV represents. An increase in the breadth of incorrect answer selections by novices indicates they became more confused about what happens to energy from an earthquake when shown a GMV. Lower performance on other post-GMV questions by novices suggests that the current style of GMVs are unable to teach basic seismological concepts to people who do not have some formal geoscience training. Although web traffic to GMVs indicates people's interest in watching the videos, watching GMVs does not appear to translate to improved understanding of seismic waves for novices. Future development of dynamic visualizations such as GMVs should consider the cognitive load these learning materials impose on the learner and seek to further implement principles of multimedia instructional design that minimize cognitive processing demands. Supplemental Content: Multiple-choice quiz focused on assessing basic understanding of the ground-motion visualization (GMV).

A proposed mechanism by which temporally and spatially segregated information is encoded at the cellular level is based on the interactive properties of synapses located within and across functional dendritic compartments. We examined cooperative and interfering interactions between long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), two forms of synaptic plasticity thought to be key in the encoding of information in the brain. Two approaches were used in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the mouse hippocampus: (1) induction of LTP and LTD in two separate synaptic pathways within the same apical dendritic compartment and across the basal and apical dendritic compartments; (2) induction of LTP and LTD separated by various time intervals (0-90 min). Expression of LTP/LTD interactions was spatially and temporally regulated. While they were largely restricted within the same dendritic compartment (compartmentalized), the nature of the interaction (cooperation or interference) depended on the time interval between inductions. New protein synthesis was found to regulate the expression of the LTP/LTD interference. We speculate that mechanisms for compartmentalization and protein synthesis confer the spatial and temporal modulation by which neurons encode multiplex information in plastic synapses.

Characterizing landscape-scale erosion using <SUP>10</SUP>Be in detrital fluvial sediment: Slope-based sampling strategy detects the effect of widespread dams	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						cosmogenic; erosion; slope; experimental design; dams; model	SITU-PRODUCED BE-10; COSMOGENIC NUCLIDES; ALLUVIAL SEDIMENT; DENUDATION RATES; RIVER SEDIMENT; EQUILIBRIUM; AL-26	Concentrations of in situ Be-10 measured in detrital fluvial sediment are frequently used to estimate long-term erosion rates of drainage basins. In many regions, basin-averaged erosion rates are positively correlated with basin average slope. The slope dependence of erosion allows model-based erosion rate estimation for unsampled basins and basins where human disturbance may have biased cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in sediment. Using samples collected from southeastern North America, we demonstrate an approach that explicitly considers the relationship between average basin slope and erosion rate. Because dams and reservoirs are ubiquitous on larger channels in the field area, we selected 36 undammed headwater subbasins (average area 10.6 km(2)) from which we collected river sand samples and measured Be-10 concentrations. We used these data to train a predictive model that relates average basin slope and Be-10-inferred erosion rate. Applying our model to 28 basins in the same region previously studied with Be-10, we find that the model successfully predicts erosion rates for basins of different sizes if they are undammed or if samples were collected >25 km downstream of dams. For samples collected closer to dams, measured erosion rates exceed modeled erosion rates for two-thirds of the samples. In three of four cases where paired samples were collected upstream of reservoirs and downstream of the impounding dam, Be-10 concentrations were lower downstream. This finding has implications for detrital cosmogenic studies, whether or not samples were collected directly downstream of dams, because dams obstruct most major rivers around the world, effectively trapping sediment that originated upstream. Plain Language Summary Measuring the rate at which Earth eroded before humans arrived and changed the landscape is tricky business. Over the last two decades, geologists have used a collection of chemical and isotopic techniques, based on counting atoms rare in nature, to estimate how quickly parts of the landscape erode. They've collected and analyzed thousands of samples and now we know that some regions of the globe erode so rapidly that the landscape changes a few centimeters every hundred years whereas other landscape are so stable, only a hair's width of rock will erode per millennium. The problem is that dams can get in the way. Working in the heavily dammed southeastern United States, we show that samples collected within 25 kilometers of dams often lead to inaccurate results, overestimating long term erosion rates. We conclude that recent, human impacts on the landscape are likely even more damaging than previously thought, stripping soil and farm land at an unsustainable rate.

Engineering the shape of nanomaterials is an effective strategy for optimizing their bioactive performance. Nanomaterials with a unique shape are beneficial to blood circulation, tumor targeting, cell uptake, and even improved magnetism properties. Therefore, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) nanoprobes with different shapes have been extensively focused on in recent years. Different from other multimodal imaging techniques, dual-mode MRI can provide imaging simultaneously by a single instrument, which can avoid differences in penetration depth, and the spatial and temporal resolution of multiple imaging devices, and ensure the accurate matching of spatial and temporal imaging parameters for the precise diagnosis of early tumors. This review summarizes the latest developments of nanomaterials with various shapes for T-1-T-2 dual-mode MRI, and highlights the mechanism of how shape intelligently affects nanomaterials' longitudinal or transverse relaxation, namely sphere, hollow, core-shell, cube, cluster, flower, dumbbell, rod, sheet, and bipyramid shapes. In addition, the combination of T-1-T-2 dual-mode MRI nanoprobes and advanced therapeutic strategies, as well as possible challenges from basic research to clinical transformation, are also systematically discussed. Therefore, this review will help others quickly understand the basic information on dual-mode MRI nanoprobes and gather thought-provoking ideas to advance the subfield of cancer nanomedicine.

Hydrogels have long been thought to be excellent ionic conductors for wearable electronics, because of their high stretchability, transparency, and excellent ionic conductivity. However, due to the huge differences between the underwater and air environments, the previously reported soft materials can rarely satisfy the critical needs of adhesive, underwater stability, and steady conductivity. Herein, an ionogel is proposed with abundant physical and chemical cross-linked, involving ion-dipole, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding interactions, to achieve excellent mechanical strength, resilience, and underwater stability. The ionogel with long-lasting underwater adherence and durability is further assembled into a high sensitivity, fast response, and excellent durability underwater wearable sensor. The ionogel sensor demonstrated high precision in various human motion detection and Morse code is used to transmit information both in the air and underwater. In addition, the tough underwater adhesion and the distinct discrepancy in electrical properties in different concentration solutions enable the ionogel sensor to adhere to the surface of marine animals and monitor the water quality in their habitats. It is identified that the designed ionogel possesses great promise in wearable devices and soft ionotronics.

Thus, the present study was designed to answer the question of what brain areas are active during performance of complex reading strategies. Reading comprehension strategies are designed to improve a reader's comprehension of a text. For example, self-explanation is a complex reading strategy that enhances existing comprehension processes. It was hypothesized that reading strategies would involve areas of the brain that are normally involved in reading comprehension along with areas that are involved in strategic control processes because the readers are intentionally using a complex reading strategy. Subjects were asked to reread, paraphrase, and self-explain three different texts in a block design fMRI study. Activation was found in both executive control and comprehension areas, and furthermore, learning from text was associated with activation in the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC). The authors speculate that the aPFC may play a role in coordinating the internal and external modes of thought that are necessary for integrating new knowledge from texts with prior knowledge.

Reevaluating onsite wastewater systems: expert recommendations and municipal decision-making	WATER POLICY			English	Article						Decentralized; Decision-making; Feasibility reports; Onsite systems; Wastewater management	TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES; SEPTIC SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; DENSITY; COST	Onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) serve 20-25% of the households in the USA, and large parts of rural Canada, Australia, and Europe. Urbanization and newer environmental standards are leading many communities that currently rely on OWTS to think of alternatives. We study this decision-making in 19 municipalities across the USA through the unique lens of feasibility reports commissioned by the respective municipalities and authored by engineering/design consulting firms. The reports omitted certain essential information relevant to the decision-making process, and were not of high quality due to a lack of specificity on various parameters. However, the reports evaluated a balanced mix of decentralized and centralized treatment options, and the final recommendations were not biased in any particular direction. Most municipalities failed to take any follow-up action on the report recommendations, calling into question the motive behind commissioning these reports. Although not representative of the entire USA, the small sample of feasibility reports evaluated here is indicative in nature and provided significant insights about the inputs that help municipalities make decisions on complex issues.

Design: Randomised controlled trial. The intervention group received the "Walk in to Work Out" pack, which contained written interactive materials based on the transtheoretical model of behaviour change, local information about distances and routes, and safety information. The control group received the pack six months later. Focus groups were also conducted after six months. Setting: Three workplaces in the city of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. Participants: 295 employees who had been identified as thinking about, or doing some irregular, walking or cycling to work. Main results: The intervention group was almost twice as likely to increase walking to work as the control group at six months (odds ratio of 1.93, 95% confidence intervals 1.06 to 3.52). The intervention was not successful at increasing cycling. There were no distance travelled to work, gender, or age influences on the results. Twenty five per cent (95% confidence intervals 17% to 32%) of the intervention group, who received the pack at baseline, were regularly actively commuting at the 12 month follow up. Conclusion: The "Walk in to Work Out" pack was successful in increasing walking but not cycling. The environment for cycling must be improved before cycling will become a popular option.

Synthetic biology technologies offer the potential to enhance coral resilience to higher water temperatures. To explore what the public think of genetically engineered coral as a future solution, qualitative responses to an open-ended question in a survey of 1,148 of the Australian public were analysed. More respondents supported the technology (59%) than did not (11%). However, a considerable proportion indicated moderate support (29%). Participants commented about the (moral) right to interfere with nature and uncertainty regarding the consequences of implementing the technology. Participants also mentioned the need to take responsibility and act to save the reef, as well as the benefits likely to result from implementing the technology. Other themes included a desire for further testing and proof, more information, and tight regulation and controls when introducing the technology.

Rather than focusing on a few models, diversity is its trademark. Here we present an overview of the Wageningen crop and crop-soil modelling approaches along three criteria. The first criterion relates to the production situations the models are dealing with (i.e. potential, water and/or nutrient-limited, and actual production situations including pests, diseases and weeds). Second, models differ as a result of the objectives of model development, and hence required scale and degree of detail and comprehensiveness. Third, models have at least three potential application domains, i.e. research, education and support of learning and decision making processes. We describe both summary and more comprehensive modelling approaches for the major production situations. An overview of most of the Wageningen models is presented together with a more detailed description of LINTUL, SUCROS, ORYZA, WOFOST and INTERCOM. Illustrations for each of the three application domains are presented, i.e. plant type design, guiding experimental research, education, yield gap analysis, evaluation of manure policies, crop growth monitoring system and analysis and design of farming and regional land use systems. We discuss common issues of model verification, model validation, model validity and data requirements, and present information on software implementation, model and software documentation and distribution policy. Finally, we reflect upon the Wageningen modelling approaches and identify a number of key issues for future research. Major achievements of Wageningen modelling efforts include (1) a broad variety of approaches for modelling of systems at different scales and with different purposes; (2) their contribution to quantitative systems thinking in general, also for applications at higher hierarchical levels; (3) a strong linkage between crop modelling and higher education, both at undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral level. To continually increase our understanding of crops and production systems a diversified approach must be cherished. At the same time we conclude that focus is required on a limited number of modules in a more integrated modelling framework for the benefit of analysing, evaluating and designing cropping systems. This review may be instrumental in the development of such an integrated framework. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Some imaging methods based on physical or learning models have been designed for object reconstruction. However, with an increase in exposure time or more drastic changes in the scattering medium, the speckle pattern superimposed during camera integration time undergoes more significant changes, resulting in a modification of the collected speckle structure and increased blurring, which brings significant challenges to the reconstruction. Here, the clearer structural information of blurred speckles is unearthed with a presented speckle de-blurring algorithm, and a high-throughput imaging method through rapidly changing scattering media is proposed for reconstruction under long exposure. For the problem of varying blur degrees in different regions of the speckle, a block-based method is proposed to divide the speckle into distinct sub-speckles, which can realize the reconstruction of hidden objects. The imaging of hidden objects with different complexity through dynamic scattering media is demonstrated, and the reconstruction results are improved significantly for speckles with different blur degrees, which verifies the effectiveness of the method. This method is a high-throughput approach that enables non-invasive imaging solely through the collection of a single speckle. It directly operates on blurred speckles, making it suitable for traditional speckle-correlation methods and deep learning (DL) methods. This provides a new way of thinking about solving practical scattering imaging challenges.

Examination of the interaction of chitosan and oil-in-water emulsions under conditions simulating the digestive system using confocal microscopy	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC FOOD PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						chitosan; confogal microscopy; lipid interaction; obesity	HIGH-FAT DIET; PANCREATIC LIPASE ACTIVITY; BILE-SALT; GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT; ACID; ABSORPTION; EXCRETION; LECITHIN; PH	Chitosan is a cationic biopolymer that has been used extensively in dietary supplements to reduce fat absorption in the fight against obesity. The mechanism of fat binding of chitosan is still not fully understood and has been the subject of controversy. This study was designed to improve the understanding of the underlying mechanism by investigating the interaction of chitosan with oil-in-water emulsion droplets. Our results indicated that (0.1% w/w) chitosan adsorbed to a 20% w/w phosphatidylcholine-stabilized anionic primary emulsion to form a secondary cationic emulsion by electrostatic attraction forces under conditions resembling the stomach (pH 2). Bile salts (6 mM) were added to simulate secretion in the small intestine and pH increase. Bile salts adsorbed to the chitosan secondary emulsion, which resulted in aggregation of oil droplets followed by coalescence due to close packing of droplets. Increased viscosity (267-2531 cp) and increased degree of deacetylation (40-92% DDA) of chitosan enhanced emulsion breakdown. Increasing the pH to 7.5 without addition of bile salts yielded little aggregation. Pronounced aggregation is thought to decrease the accessibility of lipase to the oil resulting in lower bioavailability and reduced caloric intake. Understanding how chitosan interacts with oil droplets in the digestive tract is vital to developing a comprehensive model of the influence of chitosan on the bioavailability of dietary lipids. The information gained in this study may be useful for the interpretation and experimental design of animal and human feeding studies and for the rational design of chitosan-based functional foods for fat reduction.

However, as compared to secondary care, little is known about how patient safety is managed in prehospital care settings. Objectives: The objectives of this systematic review were to identify and classify the methods of measuring and monitoring patient safety that have been used in prehospital care using the five dimensions of the Measuring and Monitoring Safety (MMS) framework and use this classification to identify where there are safety 'blind spots' and make recommendations for how these deficits could be addressed. Methods: Searches were conducted in January 2020, with no limit on publication year, using Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Web of Science and Academic Search. Reference lists of included studies and existing related reviews were also screened. English-language, peer-reviewed studies concerned with measuring and monitoring safety in prehospital care were included. Two researchers independently extracted data from studies and applied a quality appraisal tool (the Quality Assessment Tool for Studies with Diverse Designs). Results: A total of 5301 studies were screened, with 52 included in the review. A total of 73% (38/52) of the studies assessed past harm, 25% (13/52) the reliability of safety critical processes, 1.9% (1/52) sensitivity to operations, 38.5% (20/52) anticipation and preparedness and 5.8% (3/52) integration and learning. A total of 67 methods for measuring and monitoring safety were used across the included studies. Of these methods, 38.8% (26/67) were surveys, 29.9% (20/67) were patient records reviews, 14.9% (10/67) were incident reporting systems, 11.9% (8/67) were interviews or focus groups and 4.5% (3/67) were checklists. Conclusions: There is no single method of measuring and monitoring safety in prehospital care. Arguably, most safety monitoring systems have evolved, rather than been designed. This leads to safety blind spots in which information is lacking, as well as to redundancy and duplication of effort. It is suggested that the findings from this systematic review, informed by the MMS framework, can provide a structure for critically thinking about how safety is being measured and monitored in prehospital care. This will support the design of a safety surveillance system that provides a comprehensive understanding of what is being done well, where improvements should be made and whether safety interventions have had the desired effect.

METEOR Study Investigators	Extensive or Restricted Ultrasound Protocols to Measure Carotid Intima-Media Thickness: Analysis of Completeness Rates and Impact on Observed Rates of Change Over Time	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY			English	Article						Carotid intima-media thickness; Ultrasound protocols; Completeness rates; Trial design	SITE-SPECIFIC PROGRESSION; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; SUBCLINICAL ATHEROSCLEROSIS; ARTERIAL-WALL; RISK-FACTORS; REPRODUCIBILITY; PREDICTION; INTERVENTION; ROSUVASTATIN; DETERMINANTS	Background: Ultrasound protocols to measure carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) vary considerably with regard to carotid sites and angles that are assessed. Measurements from the carotid bifurcation and internal carotid artery are thought to be affected by large numbers of missing data. Actual published quantification of completeness rates and the relation with cardiovascular risk factors, however, is scarce. Also, it is currently unknown whether extensive ultrasound protocols including assessment of the carotid bifurcation and internal carotid artery add information in detecting rate of change in CIMT induced by drug therapy. These issues were addressed in this study using data from Measuring Effects on Intima-Media Thickness: An Evaluation of Rosuvastatin (METEOR). Methods: In METEOR, carotid ultrasound examinations were performed twice before randomization, once each at 6, 12, and 18 months after randomization, and twice after 24 months of study treatment. B-mode ultrasound images were obtained from the near and far walls of the left and right common carotid artery, bifurcation, and internal carotid artery at five predefined angles. Completeness of CIMT data was assessed by carotid site and by angle. A site was considered complete when any of the five angles was measured. The relation between completeness at baseline and cardiovascular risk factors was assessed using logistic regression analyses. Ultrasound protocols with a reduced number of carotid sites and angles were retrospectively constructed, and differences in the rate of change in maximum CIMT between ultrasound protocols were compared. Results: At each visit, CIMT measurements from all 12 carotid sites were available for >94% of the participants. Incompleteness was the highest for near wall of the internal carotid artery and for the extreme angles (60 degrees and 300 degrees). Of 12 risk factors examined, higher body mass index was related to incompleteness. Ultrasound protocols with a reduced number of angles resulted in similar estimates for the differences in rate of change in maximum CIMT. However, reductions in the number of sites gave results in the same direction but with different magnitudes and larger standard errors. Conclusions: High levels of complete data can be obtained with extensive ultrasound protocols that include measurement from the carotid bifurcation and internal carotid artery. A high body mass index contributes to incompleteness of CIMT measurements. Extensive ultrasound protocols are required to obtain the highest precision to observe a treatment effect and to fully cover the degree of atherosclerotic burden.

Five volunteers each performed three searches using two systems (NPR Online and SpeechBot) for three questions and judged the relevance of the results. Data were collected through observation and screen capture, think aloud, and interviews; coded; and analyzed by looking for patterns. Criteria used as a basis for selection were found to be similar to those observed in relevance studies with printed materials, but the attributes used as a basis for assessing those criteria were found to exhibit modality-specific characteristics. For example, audio replay was often found to be necessary when assessing story genre (e.g., report, interview, commentary) because of limitations in presently available metadata. Participants reported a strong preference for manually prepared summaries over passages extracted from automatic speech recognition transcripts, and consequential differences in search behavior were observed between the two conditions. Some important implications for interface and component design are drawn, such as the utility of summaries at multiple levels of detail in view of the difficulty of skimming imperfect transcripts and the potential utility of automatic speaker identification to support authority judgments in systems.

Word stem completion is one task in which subjects can be instructed either to make a deliberate recall (explicit instruction) or to be told to complete the stem with any appropriate word (implicit instruction). Positron emission tomography (PET) studies have indicated that during implicit retrieval, there is reduced blood flow in right posterior areas, whereas some tasks of explicit retrieval involve frontal and hippocampal activation, However, there is no information about the timing of these activations or how implicit and explicit retrieval might be related, We used word stem completion tasks similar to those used in the PET studies, but used high-density electrical recording designed to allow localization of the regions involved in the tasks and to provide temporal information, We found reduced activity far primed words in right posterior cortex corresponding to previous PET results, The reduction occurred within the first 200 msec after input, suggesting early interaction with the information stored in this area, Similar reductions observed during explicit recall of the previously presented words indicate that priming is similar under implicit and explicit conditions. In addition, when priming was not an adequate basis for response, then frontal areas were active. Retrieval of unprimed words under implicit instruction elicited right frontal activation, whereas explicit retrieval activated frontal areas bilaterally. Left frontal and hippocampal activations appear to occur only when the retrieval involved use of the words from the list studied previously.

The performance index of a robot, such as kinematic accuracy, bearing capacity, deformation, vibration, stability, and structural mode can all be calculated according to the motion displacement of the robot. Therefore, improving the robot motion measurement method, promoting the measurement accuracy, and enriching the measurement content have received considerable scholarly attention worldwide. In this paper, an approach based on binocular vision was proposed to measure the 3D spatial motion of a robot. In the process of reconstructing robot movement, a mathematical model that can facilitate the solving process and improve the accuracy of results was derived to build 3D coordinates information. A novel coordinate transformation method that is based on the singular value decomposition was drawn up to realize the transformation from camera coordinates to robot coordinates. Several experiments were carried out on the self-built three-degree-of-freedom rectangular coordinate robot platform. The marker was designed specially and glued to the end of robot, and a new train of thought was adopted to extract the marker's feature point. The vision-based measurement results were compared with the actual coordinate value. Results of experiments demonstrated that the proposed method can successfully reconstruct the 3D spatial motion of a robot more exactly, which can meet the requirements of high-precision motion control, motion performance evaluation, and operation state evaluation.

Boosting for detection of gene-environment interactions	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						effect modification; gene-environment interaction; interaction; L2 boosting; WHI	REGRESSION	In genetic association studies, it is typically thought that genetic variants and environmental variables jointly will explain more of the inheritance of a phenotype than either of these two components separately. Traditional methods to identify geneenvironment interactions typically consider only one measured environmental variable at a time. However, in practice, multiple environmental factors may each be imprecise surrogates for the underlying physiological process that actually interacts with the genetic factors. In this paper, we develop a variant of L2 boosting that is specifically designed to identify combinations of environmental variables that jointly modify the effect of a gene on a phenotype. Because the effect modifiers might have a small signal compared with the main effects, working in a space that is orthogonal to the main predictors allows us to focus on the interaction space. In a simulation study that investigates some plausible underlying model assumptions, our method outperforms the least absolute shrinkage and selection and Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion model selection procedures as having the lowest test error. In an example for the Women's Health Initiative-Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology study, the dedicated boosting method was able to pick out two single-nucleotide polymorphisms for which effect modification appears present. The performance was evaluated on an independent test set, and the results are promising. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DESIGN Qualitative study using content and semantic analyses of information supplied in focus groups. SETTING All family physician respondents were associated with departments of family medicine at two urban hospitals and had expressed interest in this study; all immigrant patients were recruited from the English-as-a-Second-Language program at a community agency. PARTICIPANTS Thirteen immigrant patients, distributed in two groups (one of seven women and one man and one of three men and two women), and five family physicians (two women and three men). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Responses to prepared questions asked in focus groups. RESULTS Family physicians thought that understanding patients' cultures better would improve quality of care. Patients did not always understand why their physicians asked questions about their culture, sometimes finding these questions irrelevant or intrusive. Comments were used to formulate recommendations for patient-physician interactions. CONCLUSIONS Physicians and patients are aware of culture as a factor in their relationships but differ on its importance to quality of care.

One group of students was asked to analyze a sequence of images designed to represent critical elements in the explanation of a target phenomenon. Another group of students was asked to analyze an illustrated text that introduced core concepts and ideas needed to understand the same phenomenon. Our study revealed major differences but also important similarities in student reasoning under the two conditions. Analyses of images led to more descriptive and limited accounts of the phenomenon than the analyses of text. However, these latter analyses often were plagued by conceptual confusions. Mechanistic explanations built under the two conditions frequently invoked a single causal factor as responsible for the phenomenon. Probabilistic effects were consistently neglected in these explanations.

However, much less is known about the ontogeny of identity information-when and how this individual/group distinctiveness in vocalizations arises and how it changes during the animal's life. Recent findings suggest that even species that were thought to have limited vocal plasticity could adjust their calls to sound more similar to each other within a group. It has already been shown that sows can acoustically distinguish their own offspring from alien piglets and that litters differ in their calls. Surprisingly, individual identity in piglet calls has not been reported yet. In this paper, this gap is filled, and it is shown that there is information about piglet identity. Information about litter identity is confirmed as well. Individual identity increased with age, but litter vocal identity did not increase with age. The results were robust as a similar pattern was apparent in two situations differing in arousal: isolation and back-test. This paper argues that, in piglets, increased individual discrimination results from the rapid growth of piglets, which is likely to be associated with growth and diversification of the vocal tract rather than from social effects and vocal plasticity.

A spatial error model of greenspace types and mental wellbeing	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE			English	Article						Greenspace; built environment; GIS; urban planning	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; HEALTH; SPACE; NEIGHBORHOOD; ENVIRONMENTS; GREENNESS; GREENER	Exposure to nature is thought to benefit mental health and wellbeing. However, many studies consider greenspace as a single entity, which overlooks the potential significance of the various forms of greenspace, and natural greenspaces in particular. This study was designed to investigate the association between different types of greenspace and mental wellbeing. Drawing wellbeing and socioeconomic data from the Annual Population Survey (2012-2015), and shapefiles from the Greenspace Information for Greater London group, the amount of greenspace accessible within a 300 m walk of individual's postcodes was calculated, and categorised according to type. Spatial Error Models were used to account for spatial patterns in the data. Natural greenspace was significantly associated with improved life satisfaction (B = 0.028, p < 0.001) and happiness (B = 0.023, p = 0.019) scores. The spatial autoregressive parameter (lambda) was small but significant (p < 0.001), implying slight second-order spatial variation in the model. These results imply that natural areas may be more important for hedonic mental wellbeing than other greenspaces. Future research is needed on exploring causal relationships between exposure to greenspace and mental wellbeing outcomes.

Every one intends to make money, while it is not easy to make money in the financial market. From the long-term experience in the entire market, merely few people could take money home, but most people put money in the market without returns. No matter how much a person refine the skills, enhance the knowledge or search for more price-related information, the presented operation performance cannot achieve the expectation. Different from general investors, winners in the market do not study various economic data or make predictions but present graceful attitudes. How do winners think? By discussing investors' psychology, this study intends to discuss the effect of investor anxiety on risks of investment, preference, and investment performance. With experimental design, 360 students of department of finance in universities in Liaoning are proceeded the virtual investment contest. The research results reveal significant effects of investor anxiety on 1.risks of investment, 2.preference, and 3.investment performance. According to the results, suggestions are proposed, expecting to help investors effectively enhance investment performance in the financial market.

Rational integration of plasmonic metal nanostructures with semiconductors in an appropriate fashion is beneficial for creating a large variety of plasmonic metal/semiconductor photoelectrodes. However, up to date, construction of well-defined and highly efficient plasmonic metal/semiconductor heterostructures is still in its infant stage. In this review, basic principles of PEC water splitting over semiconductors, SPR-excited plasmonic effect of metal nanostructures, and their intrinsic correlation with each other are first concisely introduced. Subsequently, it is paid great attention to specifically summarize the diverse plasmonic metal/semiconductor photoelectrodes currently being extensively explored for indirect plasmon-induced PEC water splitting. Particularly, different plasmonic metal/semiconductor nanoarchitectures including planar thin films, 1D composited, and 3D spatially hierarchical heterostructures are systematically classified and elucidated. Finally, future perspectives and challenges in triggering further innovative thinking on plasmon-enhanced solar water splitting are envisaged. It is anticipated that this review can provide enriched information on rational design and construction of various plasmonic metal/semiconductor heterostructures for solar-powered plasmon-based PEC devices.

J	Kash, I; Procaccia, AD; Shah, N				Kash, Ian; Procaccia, Ariel D.; Shah, Nisarg			No Agent Left Behind: Dynamic Fair Division of Multiple Resources	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article								Recently fair division theory has emerged as a promising approach for allocation of multiple computational resources among agents. While in reality agents are not all present in the system simultaneously, previous work has studied static settings where all relevant information is known upfront. Our goal is to better understand the dynamic setting. On the conceptual level, we develop a dynamic model of fair division, and propose desirable axiomatic properties for dynamic resource allocation mechanisms. On the technical level, we construct two novel mechanisms that provably satisfy some of these properties, and analyze their performance using real data. We believe that our work informs the design of superior multiagent systems, and at the same time expands the scope of fair division theory by initiating the study of dynamic and fair resource allocation mechanisms.

J	Zhang, JH; Zhang, BL				Zhang, Junhua; Zhang, Boli			Clinical research of traditional Chinese medicine in big data era	FRONTIERS OF MEDICINE			English	Article						big data; traditional Chinese medicine; clinical evaluation; evidence based medicine		With the advent of big data era, our thinking, technology and methodology are being transformed. Data-intensive scientific discovery based on big data, named "The Fourth Paradigm," has become a new paradigm of scientific research. Along with the development and application of the Internet information technology in the field of healthcare, individual health records, clinical data of diagnosis and treatment, and genomic data have been accumulated dramatically, which generates big data in medical field for clinical research and assessment. With the support of big data, the defects and weakness may be overcome in the methodology of the conventional clinical evaluation based on sampling. Our research target shifts from the "causality inference" to "correlativity analysis." This not only facilitates the evaluation of individualized treatment, disease prediction, prevention and prognosis, but also is suitable for the practice of preventive healthcare and symptom pattern differentiation for treatment in terms of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and for the post-marketing evaluation of Chinese patent medicines. To conduct clinical studies involved in big data in TCM domain, top level design is needed and should be performed orderly. The fundamental construction and innovation studies should be strengthened in the sections of data platform creation, data analysis technology and big-data professionals fostering and training.

Initial prototype testing of Ray's Night Out: A new mobile app targeting risky drinking in young people	COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Risky single occasion drinking; Alcohol; Binge drinking; Mobile; Application; Young people	CONSENSUAL QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; ALCOHOL-USE; TECHNOLOGY	Background: Risky single occasion drinking (RSOD; >= 4 drinks in <6 h) more than doubles the risk of injury in young people (15-25 years). The potential role of smartphone apps in reducing RSOD in young people is yet to be explored. Objective: To describe the initial prototype testing of 'Ray's Night Out', a new iPhone app targeting RSOD in young people. Method: Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to evaluate the quality, perceived utility, and acceptability of the app among nine young people (19-23 years). Results: Participants reported Ray's Night Out had good to excellent levels of functionality and visual appeal, acceptable to good levels of entertainment, interest and information, and acceptable levels of customization and interactivity. Young people thought the app had high levels of youth appeal, would prompt users to think about their alcohol use limits, but was unlikely to motivate a change in alcohol use in its current form. Qualitative data provided several suggestions for improving the app. Conclusion: Following revision, Ray's Night Out could provide an effective intervention for RSOD in non help-seeking young people. A randomized controlled trial is currently underway to test the final prototype of the app. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Method: A survey was distributed to radiation oncologists, urologists, medical oncologists, nurses and radiation therapy technologists (RTTs) involved in treating prostate cancer patients. Participants were asked to judge the importance of addressing each of 78 questions (essential/important/no opinion/avoid) with a described hypothetical patient prior to the treatment decision. Eighty participants were later selected at random for a retest. Results: The overall response rate was 55% (284/518) on the initial survey and 56% (45/80) on the retest. The relative importance of the various questions was similar across groups (r-(76) ranged from 0.75 to 0.91, all P < 0.001). Despite the between-group similarity, opinions within each group varied widely. For example, among oncologists, the number of questions deemed essential by individual respondents ranged from five to 69, with >90% respondent agreement on only 15 of the 78 questions. The extent of agreement was similar in the other groups. The retest showed that essential and important responses were reasonably stable, i.e. 92% of questions judged essential at one time were judged either essential (58%) or important (34%) at the other time. Conclusions: Although the relative importance of addressing the various questions appears similar across the professional groups involved in the care of prostate patients, within each profession there seems to be little agreement. The lack of agreement includes both how many questions are essential to address and whether or not most individual questions are essential. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Identification of persistent benthic assemblages in areas with different temperature variability patterns through broad-scale mapping	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SEA SCALLOP; PLACOPECTEN-MAGELLANICUS; GEORGES BANK; FISHERY-MANAGEMENT; CLOSED AREAS; ATLANTIC; USA; RECRUITMENT; MORTALITY; IMPACT	Ecosystem-based management is a place-based approach that considers the relationships between system parts. Due to the complexity of ecosystems in the marine environment it is often difficult to define these relationships in space and time. Maps illustrate spatial concepts. Here we promote ecosystem-based spatial thinking by layering datasets from a larger project that mapped benthic fauna, substrate characteristics, and oceanic conditions on monthly, annual and decadal time scales along the U.S. continental shelf. By combining maps of persistent benthic megafauna and bottom temperature variability over approximately 90,000 km(2), we identified wide spread benthic animal assemblages and regional disparity in temperature variability. From a broad-scale perspective the locations of the assemblage appear to be related to sea scallop population dynamics and indicate potential regional differences in climate change resiliency. These findings offer information on a scale that correlates with marine spatial planning, and could be used as a starting point for further investigation. To spur additional analysis and facilitate their linkage to other datasets, these datasets are available through public, online data portals. Overall, this study demonstrates how the growth of maps from single to multiple elements can help promote and facilitate the multifactor, ecosystem-based thinking needed to support regional ocean planning.

In covalent organic frameworks (COFs), the stacking strongly influences properties such as the accessibility of functional sites, pore geometry, and surface states, but the exact nature of the interlayer interactions is mostly elusive. The stacking mode is often identified as eclipsed based on observed high symmetry diffraction patterns. However, as pointed out by various studies, the energetics of eclipsed stacking are not favorable and offset stacking is preferred. This work presents lower and higher apparent symmetry modifications of the imine-linked TTI-COF prepared through high- and low-temperature reactions. Through local structure investigation by pair distribution function analysis and simulations of stacking disorder, we observe random local layer offsets in the low temperature modification. We show that while stacking disorder can be easily overlooked due to the apparent crystallographic symmetry of these materials, total scattering methods can help clarify this information and suggest that defective local structures could be much more prevalent in COFs than previously thought. A detailed analysis of the local structure helps to improve the search for and design of highly porous tailor-made materials.

There are studies to compare the traditional cartography techniques (the traditional term of Geographic Visual Display (GVD) without Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)) to Modern GIS which are also known as Geo-visualization, some literature differentiates and highlight the commonalities of features and architectures of different Geographic Visual Display tools (from layers and clusters to dot and color and more). Furthermore, with the existence of more advanced tools which support data exploration, few tasks are done to evaluate how those tools are used to handle complex and multivariate spatial-temporal data. Several test on usability and interactivity of tools toward user's needs or preferences, some even develop frameworks that address user's concern in a wide array of tasks, and others prove how these tools are able to stimulate the visual thought process and help in decision making or event prediction amongst decision-makers. This paper surveyed and categorized these research articles into 2 categories: Traditional Cartography (TC) and Geo-visualization (G). This paper will classify each category by their techniques and tasks that contribute to the significance of data representation in Geographic Visual Display and develop perspectives of each area and evaluating trends of Geographic Visual Display Techniques. Suggestions and ideas on what mechanisms can be used to improve and diversify Geographic Visual Display Techniques are provided at the end of this survey.

The Psychology of COVID-19 Booster Hesitancy, Acceptance and Resistance in Australia	VACCINES			English	Article						COVID-19; booster hesitancy; latent profile analysis; vaccine hesitancy; public health policy	LATENT PROFILE ANALYSIS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; COGNITIVE REFLECTION; HEALTH LITERACY; VACCINE HESITANCY; REACTANCE; SCALE; INTELLIGENCE; INFORMATION; POPULATION	COVID-19 booster vaccinations have been recommended as a primary line of defence against serious illness and hospitalisation. This study identifies and characterises distinct profiles of attitudes towards vaccination, particularly the willingness to get a booster dose. A sample of 582 adults from Australia completed an online survey capturing COVID-related behaviours, beliefs and attitudes and a range of sociodemographic, psychological, political, social and cultural variables. Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) identified three subgroups: Acceptant (61%), Hesitant (30%) and Resistant (9%). Compared to the Acceptant group, the Hesitant and Resistant groups were less worried about catching COVID-19, used fewer official COVID-19 information sources, checked the news less, were lower on the agreeableness personality dimension and reported more conservatism, persecutory thinking, amoral attitudes and need for chaos. The Hesitant group also reported checking the legitimacy of information sources less, scored lower on the openness to new experiences personality dimension and were more likely than the Resistant and Acceptant groups to report regaining freedoms (e.g., travel) and work requirements or external pressures as reasons to get a booster. The Resistant group were higher on reactance, held more conspiratorial beliefs and rated their culture as being less tolerant of deviance than the Hesitant and Acceptant groups. This research can inform tailored approaches to increasing booster uptake and optimal strategies for public health messaging.	[Kleitman, Sabina; Fullerton, Dayna J.; Law, Marvin K.

We aimed to look at the evolution of IBD specialists' thinking about biosimilars one year after they had become available in the European Union. Methods: A 14-question anonymous survey was posted on the ECCO website. Members voluntarily responded in response to ECCO office invitations to participate in their surveys. Information on gender, job position, country, and experience with biologics also were collected. Results: Out of the 118 responders, only 17% of responders had no access to biosimilars. Most responders regarded cost-sparing [92.4%] as the main advantage of biosimilars, considered immunogenicity [69%] to be their main concern, and estimated that post-marketing pharmacovigilance, well-designed randomized clinical trials and further studies of risk profile were needed [30.5%, 27%, 32.2%, respectively, a 30-40% reduction since 2013]. Only 35% of physicians think biosimilars should carry distinct International Nonproprietary Names, as compared with 66% in 2013, and 89.8% disagreed with automatic substitution of the originator with a biosimilar by a pharmacist. The originator and biosimilar were considered interchangeable by 44.4% of responders, as compared with 6% in 2013. Only 32.2% were against the extrapolation across indications, and only 25% would not extrapolate data across IBD. Finally, only 19.5% felt little or no confidence in the use of biosimilars, as compared with 63% in 2013. Conclusion: IBD specialists are generally well informed and educated about biosimilars. Compared with in 2013, there are now fewer concerns and more confidence about their use in clinical practice.

An intensive longitudinal study in patients with delusions and in non-clinical individuals	PLOS ONE			English	Article							THINKING STYLES; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; PARANORMAL BELIEFS; PROCESSING STYLES; COGNITIVE BIASES; POSITIVE AFFECT; IDEATION; PERSPECTIVE; PREFERENCE; JUDGMENTS	Research suggests that a jumping-to-conclusions (JTC) bias, excessive intuition, and reduced analysis in information processing may favor suboptimal decision-making, both in non-clinical and mentally disordered individuals. The temporal relationship between processing modes and JTC bias, however, remains unexplored. Therefore, using an experience sampling methodology (ESM) approach, this study examines the temporal associations between intuitive/analytical information processing, JTC bias, and delusions in non-clinical individuals and patients with schizophrenia. Specifically, we examine whether a high use of intuitive and/or a low use of analytical processing predicts subsequent JTC bias and paranoid conviction. In a smartphone-based ESM study, participants will be prompted four times per day over three consecutive days to answer questionnaires designed to measure JTC bias, paranoid conviction, and preceding everyday-life intuition/analysis. Our hierarchical data will be analyzed using multilevel modelling for hypothesis testing. Results will further elucidate the role of aberrant human reasoning, particularly intuition, in (non-)clinical delusions and delusion-like experiences, and also inform general information processing models.

In the preceding paper (Takahashi, K., Inoue, H., Sakai, K., Kohama, T., Kitahara, S., Takishima, K., Tanji, M., Athauda, S. B. P., Takahashi, T., Akanuma, H., Mamiya, G., Yamasaki, M. J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19480-19483), we reported the complete primary structure of the mature enzyme determined at the protein level. The enzyme has a unique two-chain structure with a 39-residue light (L) chain and a 173-residue heavy (H) chain linked noncovalently. As an extension of this study, we isolated genomic and cDNA clones encoding this proteinase and determined their nucleotide sequences. To isolate a genomic clone, the genomic DNA was selectively amplified by polymerase chain reaction using mixed oligonucleotide primers designed from the amino acid sequence of the H chain, and a specific probe thus generated was used for screening a lambda-gtl0 genomic library. A cDNA for the enzyme was also selectively amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers synthesized based on the sequence of the genomic DNA. Sequencing of the cloned genomic DNA and cDNA revealed the nucleotide sequence of the structural gene for the enzyme of 846 base pairs without introns. It encodes the precursor form of proteinase A, including an NH2-terminal preprosequence of 59 residues, the L chain of 39 residues, an intervening sequence of 11 residues, and the H chain of 173 residues linked in that order. Thus, proteinase A is thought to be synthesized as a single peptide chain preproenzyme of 282 residues, which is processed to generate the mature two-chain form.

As they are also often intimately associated with the mineral phase, they are thought to fulfill important functions in controlling mineral formation. Relatively little is known about these important proteins, because their acidic nature causes technical difficulties during purification and characterization procedures. Much effort has been made to overcome these problems, particularly in the study of mollusk-shell formation. To date about 16 proteins from mollusk-shell organic matrices have been sequenced, but only two are unusually rich in aspartic and glutamic acids. Here we screened a cDNA library made from the mRNA of the shelf-forming cells of a bivalve, Atrina rigida, using probes for short Asp-containing repeat sequences, and identified ten different proteins. Using more specific probes designed from one subgroup of conserved sequences, we obtained the full sequences of a family of seven aspartic acid-rich proteins, which we named "Asprich"; a subfamily of the unusually acidic shell-matrix proteins. Polyclonol antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide of the conserved acidic 1 domain of these proteins reacted specifically with the matrix components of the calcitic prismatic layer, but not with those of the aragonitic nacreous foyer, Thus the Asprich proteins are constituents of the prismatic layer shell matrix. We con identify different domains within these sequences, including a signal peptide characteristic of proteins destined for extracellular secretion, a conserved domain rich in aspartic acid that contains a sequence very similar to the calcium-binding domain of Calsequestrin, and another domain rich in aspartic acid, that varies between the seven sequences. We also identified a domain with DEAD repeats that may have Mg-binding capabilities. Although we do not know, as yet, the function of these proteins, their generally conserved sequences do indicate that they might well fulfill basic functions in shell formation.

Methods: Using a qualitative descriptive design, we collected data through individual interviews with ten women at a Norwegian university hospital between August 2007 and April 2008. We employed Kvale's method of qualitative meaning condensation analysis. Results: Themes identified were: existential concerns and finding meaning, ways of thinking and feeling about the disease, taking action, and returning to normal life. Most women experienced an increased appreciation of life and greater confidence in themselves, were more caring and compassionate towards others, and focused more on their life priorities. Their family and close relationships became more important. They accepted their situation and made the best of it. Positive thinking, physical activity, self care, nature, hobbies and work helped. Generally, they were optimistic despite a fear of cancer recurrence and uncertainty about their future. The women wanted to return to a "normal" and healthy life by distancing themselves from both the cancer environment and information about cancer. Conclusion: Uncertainty and anxiety about a potential future cancer relapse was a major undercurrent one year following surgery. Our findings emphasize the richness in these women's coping strategies, their different coping profiles and different needs, as well as some general adaptive strategies, which all fluctuated over time. Not all managed to cope equally well. Through awareness of these women's individual experiences and coping strategies, healthcare professionals can enhance these women's coping endeavours.

A.			A Digital Intervention for Primary Care Practitioners to Support Antidepressant Discontinuation (Advisor for Health Professionals): Development Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						antidepressant discontinuation; intervention development; depression; primary care; digital intervention		Background: The number of people receiving antidepressants has increased in the past 3 decades, mainly because of people staying on them longer. However, in many cases long-term treatment is not evidence based and risks increasing side effects. Additionally, prompting general practitioners (GPs) to review medication does not improve the rate of appropriate discontinuation. Therefore, GPs and other health professionals may need help to support patients discontinuing antidepressants in primary care. Objective: This study aims to develop a digital intervention to support practitioners in helping patients discontinue inappropriate long-term antidepressants (as part of a wider intervention package including a patient digital intervention and patient telephone support). Methods: A prototype digital intervention called Advisor for Health Professionals (ADvisor HP) was planned and developed using theory, evidence, and a person-based approach. The following elements informed development: a literature review and qualitative synthesis, an in-depth qualitative study, the development of guiding principles for design elements, and theoretical behavioral analyses. The intervention was then optimized through think-aloud qualitative interviews with health professionals while they were using the prototype intervention. Results: Think-aloud qualitative interviews with 19 health professionals suggested that the digital intervention contained useful information and was readily accessible to practitioners. The development work highlighted a need for further guidance on drug tapering schedules for practitioners and clarity about who is responsible for broaching the subject of discontinuation. Practitioners highlighted the need to have information in easily and quickly accessible formats because of time constraints in day-to-day practice. Some GPs felt that some information was already known to them but understood why this was included. Practitioners differed in their ideas about how they would use ADvisor HP in practice, with some preferring to read the resource in its entirety and others wanting to dip in and out as needed. Changes were made to the wording and structure of the intervention in response to the feedback provided. Conclusions: ADvisor HP is a digital intervention that has been developed using theory, evidence, and a person-based approach. The optimization work suggests that practitioners may find this tool to be useful in supporting the reduction of long-term antidepressant use. Further quantitative and qualitative evaluation through a randomized controlled trial is needed to examine the feasibility, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

The applications of this technology range from industrial control to medical devices, hence interconnecting a huge number of devices collect-ing sensitive information. Although this provides a highly dynamic network with extensive capabilities, its widespread adoption and sensitive nature of the collected data open a large number of challenges from a cybersecurity perspective. In this paper, we offer a fresh perspective on the IoT security landscape by providing a full list of reported vulnerabilites. By organizing protocols and vulnerabilities according to the TCP/IP stack, we guide both novice and expert users and developers in gaining a clear overview of the state-of-the-art IoT and its security issues. Furthermore, by discussing open problems and future di-rections, we think our paper will be helpful to the research community in designing the next generation of secure IoT.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

BitterDB: a database of bitter compounds	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							TASTE RECEPTORS; ALIGNMENT; IDENTIFICATION; PEPTIDES	Basic taste qualities like sour, salty, sweet, bitter and umami serve specific functions in identifying food components found in the diet of humans and animals, and are recognized by proteins in the oral cavity. Recognition of bitter taste and aversion to it are thought to protect the organism against the ingestion of poisonous food compounds, which are often bitter. Interestingly, bitter taste receptors are expressed not only in the mouth but also in extraoral tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract, indicating that they may play a role in digestive and metabolic processes. BitterDB database, available at http://bitterdb.agri.huji.ac.il/bitterdb/, includes over 550 compounds that were reported to taste bitter to humans. The compounds can be searched by name, chemical structure, similarity to other bitter compounds, association with a particular human bitter taste receptor, and so on. The database also contains information on mutations in bitter taste receptors that were shown to influence receptor activation by bitter compounds. The aim of BitterDB is to facilitate studying the chemical features associated with bitterness. These studies may contribute to predicting bitterness of unknown compounds, predicting ligands for bitter receptors from different species and rational design of bitterness modulators.

Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of CHM or CHM combination therapy for COVID-19. Study design: Systematic review and meta-analysis Methods: We searched for relevant studies in the CNKI, CBM, Wanfang Data, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other resources from their inception to April 15, 2020. Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies on CHM or CHM combination therapy for COVID-19 were included. Meta-analysis was performed according to the Cochrane Handbook. Results: Overall, 19 studies with 1474 patients were included. Meta-analysis showed that the overall clinical effectiveness (OR = 2.67, 95% CI 1.83-3.89, I-2 = 0%), improvement in the CT scan (OR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.803.29, I-2 = 0%), percentage of cases turning to severe/critical (OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.24-0.67, I-2 = 17.1%), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity rate (OR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.06-6.17, I-2 = 56.4%) and disappearance rate of symptoms (fever, cough, and fatigue) were superior by combined CHM treatment of COVID-19. However, there was no statistical difference between the two groups in terms of length of hospital stay (WMD = -0.46, 95% CI -3.87 - 2.95, I-2 = 99.5%), and rate of adverse effects (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.48-3.07, I-2 = 43.5%). The quality of evidence was very low to low. Conclusion: The combined treatment of COVID-19 with Chinese and Western medicine may be effective in controlling symptoms and reducing the rate of disease progression due to low quality evidence.

Although Marek's disease (MD) is well controlled by current vaccines, the evolution of MDV field viruses towards increasing virulence is concerning as a better vaccine to combat very virulent plus MDV is still lacking. Our understanding of molecular and cellular immunity to MDV and its immunopathogenesis has significantly improved, but those findings about cellular immunity to MDV are largely out-of-date, hampering the development of more effective vaccines against MD. T-cell-mediated cellular immunity was thought to be of paramount importance against MDV. However, MDV also infects macrophages, B cells and T cells, leading to immunosuppression and T-cell lymphoma. Additionally, there is limited information about how uninfected immune cells respond to MDV infection or vaccination, specifically, the mechanisms by which T cells are activated and recognize MDV antigens and how the function and properties of activated T cells correlate with immune protection against MDV or MD tumor. The current review revisits the roles of each immune cell subset and its effector mechanisms in the host immune response to MDV infection or vaccination from the point of view of comparative immunology. We particularly emphasize areas of research requiring further investigation and provide useful information for rational design and development of novel MDV vaccines.

Relationship between e-prescriptions and community pharmacy workflow	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						E-prescribing; electronic prescribing; community pharmacy; workflow	PROTOCOL ANALYSIS; TECHNOLOGY; USABILITY; ADOPTION; SYSTEMS; ERRORS	Objectives: To understand how community pharmacists use electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) technology and to describe the workflow challenges pharmacy personnel encounter as a result of using e-prescribing technology. Design: Cross-sectional qualitative study. Setting: Seven community pharmacies in Wisconsin from December 2010 to March 2011. Participants: 16 pharmacists and 14 pharmacy technicians (in three chain and four independent pharmacies). Interventions: Think-aloud protocols and pharmacy group interviews. Main outcome measures: Pharmacy staff descriptions of their use of e-prescribing technology and challenges encountered in their daily workflow related to this technology. Results: Two contributing factors were perceived to influence e-prescribing workflow: issues stemming from prescribing or transmitting software and issues from within the pharmacy. Pharmacies experienced both delayed and inaccurate e-prescriptions from physician offices. An overwhelming number of e-prescriptions with inaccurate or unclear information resulted in serious time delays for patients as pharmacists contacted physicians to clarify wrong information. In addition, lack of formal training and the disconnect between pharmacy procedures for verifying prescription accuracy and presentation of e-prescription information on the computer screen influenced the speed of processing an e-prescription. Conclusion: E-prescriptions processing can hinder pharmacy workflow. As the number of e-prescriptions transmitted to pharmacies increases because of legislative mandates, it is essential that the technology supporting e-prescriptions (both on the prescriber and pharmacy operating systems) be redesigned to facilitate pharmacy workflow processes and to prevent unintended increase in medication errors, user frustration, and stress.

At the same time, the effectiveness of the existing antibacterials is rapidly decreasing due to the spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Aim: The aim of this study was to the identify candidate molecular targets (e.g. enzymes) within essential metabolic pathways specific to a significant subset of bacterial pathogens as the first step in the rational design of new antibacterial drugs. Methods: We constructed a dataset of phylogenomic profiles (vectors that encode the similarity, measured by BLASTscores, of a gene across many species) for a series of 31 pathogenic bacteria of interest with 1073 genes taken from the reference organisms Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We applied Bayesian Decomposition, a matrix decomposition algorithm, to identify functional metabolic units comprising overlapping sets of genes in this dataset. Results: Although no information on phylogeny was provided to the system, Bayesian Decomposition retrieved the known bacteria phylogenic relationships on the basis of the proteins necessary for survival. In addition, a set of genes required by all bacteria was identified, as well as components and enzymes specific to subsets of bacteria. Conclusion: The use of phylogenomic profiles and Bayesian Decomposition provide important insights for the design of new antibacterial therapeutics.

J	Pope, C; Turnbull, J				Pope, Catherine; Turnbull, Joanne			Using the concept of hubots to understand the work entailed in using digital technologies in healthcare	JOURNAL OF HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Metaphor; Digital technologies; Computer decision support system; Urgent and emergency care	COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; CALL-HANDLERS; EMERGENCY; METAPHOR; URGENT	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the human work entailed in the deployment of digital health care technology. It draws on imagined configurations of computers and machines in fiction and social science to think about the relationship between technology and people, and why this makes implementation of digital technology so difficult. The term hubots is employed as a metaphorical device to examine how machines and humans come together to do the work of healthcare. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses the fictional depiction of hubots to reconceptualise the deployment of a particular technology - a computer decision support system (CDSS) used in emergency and urgent care services. Data from two ethnographic studies are reanalysed to explore the deployment of digital technologies in health services. These studies used comparative mixed-methods case study approaches to examine the use of the CDSS in eight different English NHS settings. The data include approximately 900 hours of observation, with 64 semi-structured interviews, 47 focus groups, and surveys of some 700 staff in call centres and urgent care centres. The paper reanalyses these data, deductively, using the metaphor of the hubot as an analytical device. Findings - This paper focuses on the interconnected but paradoxical features of both the fictional hubots and the CDSS. Health care call handling using a CDSS has created a new occupation, and enabled the substitution of some clinical labour. However, at the same time, the introduction of the technology has created additional work. There are more tasks, both physical and emotional, and more training activity is required. Thus, the labour has been intensified. Practical implications - This paper implies that if we want to realise the promise of digital health care technologies, we need to understand that these technologies substitute for and intensify labour. Originality/value - This is a novel analysis using a metaphor drawn from fiction. This allows the authors to recognise the human effort required to implement digital technologies.

A Situational Method for Creating Shared Understanding on Requirements for an Enterprise Architecture	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COOPERATIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Requirements for enterprise architecture; shared understanding; situational method engineering	SYSTEMS; SCIENCE; DESIGN	Lack of shared understanding among stakeholders is a commonly cited drawback in enterprise architecture development. Stakeholders need to have shared understanding of requirements and principles for an enterprise architecture, and the extent to which the resultant architecture addresses their concerns. However, existing approaches for enterprise architecture development lack adequate capabilities for managing aspects associated with creating shared understanding among stakeholders. Although such aspects can be largely managed by approaches for collaborative decision making and soft systems thinking, these approaches lack details on the enterprise architecture process and its products. Therefore, this paper explores ways of mutually diminishing these gaps through adopting situational method engineering, to guide the development of a situational method for enabling stakeholders to acquire shared understanding of requirements for an enterprise architecture. The situational method presented herein is a component of a broader method for supporting collaboration between stakeholders and architects during enterprise architecture creation. Although the latter was successfully evaluated in 6 enterprises, it exhibited highest performance scores in two enterprises after it. was amended with the situational method. Therefore, this paper also presents key findings from evaluating the situational method in the two agencies that are located in Uganda.

Through the joint learning strategy, the clustering-friendly multi-view features and useful multi-view complementary information can be exploited effectively to improve the clustering performance. Under the proposed joint learning framework, we design two ingenious variants of deep multi-view joint clustering models, whose multi-view fusion is implemented by two kinds of simple yet effective schemes. The first model, called DMJC-S, performs multi-view fusion in an implicit way via a novel multi-view soft assignment distribution. The second model, termed DMJC-T, defines a novel multi-view auxiliary target distribution to conduct the multi-view fusion explicitly. Both DMJC-S and DMJC-T are optimized under a KL divergence objective. Experiments on eight challenging image datasets demonstrate the superiority of both DMJC-S and DMJC-T over single/multi-view baselines and the state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed DMJC framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to model the multi-view clustering in a deep joint framework, which will provide a meaningful thinking in unsupervised multi-view learning.

J	Atkins, KL; Martin, BD; Vellinga, JM; Price, RA				Atkins, KL; Martin, BD; Vellinga, JM; Price, RA			STARDUST: implementing a new manage-to-budget paradigm	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th IAA International Conference on Low Cost Planetary Missions	MAY 02-05, 2000	JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV, APPL PHYS LAB, LAUREL, MARYLAND	IAA	JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV, APPL PHYS LAB			STARDUST is the Discovery Program's fourth mission. It follows Lunar Prospector, Mars Pathfinder and the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission. Launched on February 7, 1999, the STARDUST flight system will collect comet samples during a 6 km/s flyby of Comet Wild 2 on New Year's day, 2004, and return the samples to Earth in January 2006. Enroute to the comet, STARDUST will also attempt to collect samples of interstellar dust. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) provides project and mission management with Lockheed Martin Astronautics (LMA) as the industrial partner for the flight and ground systems. LMA made strong use of developments in the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) and the Mars Surveyor '98 projects preceding STARDUST. Under the stringent cost-caps of the Discovery Program, the STARDUST development was completed on time with nearly $2M remaining reserves to reprogramming into the flight phase. The STARDUST management team aggressively worked to achieve this control through the use of total quality management (TQM) and reengineering principles, and commercially available software tools. The approach was to develop project-to-project interfaces exploiting parts stores and common procurements, shared staffing and shared facilities. Inheriting parts, hardware, software and designs leveraged dollars efficiently to accelerate the development, while staying inside a constrained budget. Additionally, to achieve the required level of time efficiency and budget control, a new level of communications and data handling (read excellent Management Information System [MIS]) is mandatory. Finessing the rigidity of traditional Performance Management (or Measurement) Systems (PMS) and institutional/corporate cultures requires a new way thinking and a cheerleader aggressiveness. STARDUST organized toward the Integrated Product Development Team (IPDT) concept as a central feature. This was matrixed into a dedicated Product Development Office (PDO) at LMA. The PDO served the leveraging goal by serving two projects, STARDUST and Mars Surveyor '98. It avoided duplicate project-unique personnel structures and offered cost benefits to each project. This paper provides details and example metrics characterizing the aggressive application of the design-to-cost paradigm and implementation by the STARDUST management team to achieve success under the Discovery Program budget constraints.

J	Jiang, W; Yu, WC				Jiang, Wei; Yu, Weichuan			Power estimation and sample size determination for replication studies of genome-wide association studies	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Conference (APBC)	JAN 11-13, 2016	San Francisco, CA			Replication study; Power; Empirical Bayes	WINNERS CURSE; ODDS RATIOS; PROPORTION; BIAS; NULL	Background: Replication study is a commonly used verification method to filter out false positives in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). If an association can be confirmed in a replication study, it will have a high confidence to be true positive. To design a replication study, traditional approaches calculate power by treating replication study as another independent primary study. These approaches do not use the information given by primary study. Besides, they need to specify a minimum detectable effect size, which may be subjective. One may think to replace the minimum effect size with the observed effect sizes in the power calculation. However, this approach will make the designed replication study underpowered since we are only interested in the positive associations from the primary study and the problem of the "winner's curse" will occur. Results: An Empirical Bayes (EB) based method is proposed to estimate the power of replication study for each association. The corresponding credible interval is estimated in the proposed approach. Simulation experiments show that our method is better than other plug-in based estimators in terms of overcoming the winner's curse and providing higher estimation accuracy. The coverage probability of given credible interval is well-calibrated in the simulation experiments. Weighted average method is used to estimate the average power of all underlying true associations. This is used to determine the sample size of replication study. Sample sizes are estimated on 6 diseases from Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) using our method. They are higher than sample sizes estimated by plugging observed effect sizes in power calculation. Conclusions: Our new method can objectively determine replication study's sample size by using information extracted from primary study. Also the winner's curse is alleviated. Thus, it is a better choice when designing replication studies of GWAS. The R-package is available at: http://bioinformatics.ust.hk/RPower.html.

Patient decision making about organ quality in liver transplantation	LIVER TRANSPLANTATION			English	Article							RISK; INFORMATION; VALIDATION	It is challenging to discuss the use of high-risk organs with patients, in part because of the lack of information about how patients view this topic. This study was designed to determine how patients think about organ quality and to test formats for risk communication. Semistructured interviews of 10 patients on the waiting list revealed limited understanding about the spectrum of organ quality and a reluctance to consider anything but the best organs. A computerized quantitative survey was then conducted with an interactive graph to elicit the risk of graft failure that patients would accept. Fifty-eight percent of the 95 wait-listed patients who completed the survey would accept only organs with a risk of graft failure of 25% or less at 3 years, whereas 18% would accept only organs with the lowest risk possible (19% at 3 years). Risk tolerance was increased when the organ quality was presented relative to average organs rather than the best organs and when feedback was provided about the implications for organ availability. More than three-quarters of the patients reported that they wanted an equal or dominant role in organ acceptance decisions. Men tended to prefer lower risk organs (mean acceptable risk = 29%) in comparison with women (mean acceptable risk = 35%, P = 0.04), but risk tolerance was not associated with other demographic or clinical characteristics (eg, the severity of liver disease). In summary, patients want to be involved in decisions about organ quality. Patients' risk tolerance varies widely, and their acceptance of high-risk organs can be facilitated if we present the risks of graft failure with respect to average organs and provide feedback about the implications for organ availability.

J	Meeuwisse, WH; Love, EJ				Meeuwisse, WH; Love, EJ			Development, implementation, and validation of the Canadian intercollegiate sport injury registry	CLINICAL JOURNAL OF SPORT MEDICINE			English	Article						athletic injury; registry; reporting; epidemiology; risk; cause; validity; validation	COLLEGE FOOTBALL; KNEE INJURIES; ATHLETIC INJURIES; PLAYERS	Purpose: To outline the development and implementation of the Canadian Intercollegiate Sport Injury Registry (CISIR), to examine its validity, including the data collection forms, the recording of athlete exposure, and the mechanism of injury, and to determine the ability of the CISIR to meet its stated objectives of assessing rates and risks of injury. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Canadian intercollegiate athletics. Subjects: 344 varsity football players from five western Canadian universities. Assessment of Risk Factors and Outcome Measures: Three data collection instruments were developed to capture the principle types of information forming the cornerstones of the CISIR: a medical form for preseason assessment of risk factors, a weekly exposure sheet (WES) for the documentation of daily individual athlete participation, and an individual injury report form (IIRF) for collection of injury-related information. Design and implementation input was provided by therapists and physicians through initial meetings, pilot testing, site visits, questionnaire, and final consensus meeting. The completeness of injury reporting was assessed through crossreferencing with participation time loss data. An item analysis was conducted on the principal elements of the ILRF. The categorization of participation itself was also examined, as was the diagnostic agreement between the therapists and physicians involved in data collection. The recorded mechanism of injury was compared with that noted through a video analysis for game-related injuries. Lastly, a test analysis was conducted to extract data and compute rates and risks of injury. Results: This developmental phase was successful, with 99.7% subject enrollment, high therapist satisfaction, and good flow of data. A relational database, incorporating dual-entry data verification, was designed and functioned well. The collection process revealed that 100% of the WESs were submitted, and the data therein was 99.7% complete. The injuries resulting in participation time loss were recorded on an IIRF 97.9% of the time. The exposure (participation) codes were thought to be overly precise, and a simplification of these categories is suggested. The diagnostic agreement between physicians and therapists was 70%. It was possible to validate game exposures, but no standard was identified to permit validation of the categories of exposure. Likewise, the mechanism of injury as recorded by the therapists was thought to be more precise than the video analysis. After two modifications in the table structure of the relational database, it was possible to extract data relating to rates and risks of injury. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a high degree of validity for many elements of the CISIR. One limitation was that no reference standard existed for some components, limiting some aspects of validity assessment. With the suggested revisions, the CISIR represents the current standard in athletic injury reporting in terms of individual injury risk assessment. This system will be used in the future to explore the prediction and prevention of sport injuries.

Emotional and stigma-related experiences relative to being told one is at risk for psychosis	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Clinical high risk; Prodrome; Labeling; Pre-post; Feedback	YOUNG-PEOPLE; AT-RISK; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DIAGNOSIS; PRODROME	Objective: Despite the appeal of early intervention in psychosis, there is concern that identifying youth as having high psychosis risk (PR) may trigger stigma. This study employed a pre-post design to measure change in PR participants' emotions about PR upon being told of their PR status and according to whether this was the first time receiving this information. Methods: Participants (n = 54) identified as at PR via structured interview rated their emotions about PR before and after being told they were at PR. Qualitative analyses explored the valence of participant reflections on being given this information. Results: Participants reported significantly less negative emotion after being told of their PR status (p < .001), regardless of whether they were hearing this for the first time (p = .72). There was no change in positive emotions or the predominant belief that they should keep their PR status private. Most participants commented positively about the process of feedback but negatively about its impact on their self-perceptions and/or expectations of others' perceptions of them. Conclusion: This is the first study to collect pre-post data related to being told one is at PR and to examine quantitative and qualitative responses across and within individuals. For a majority of participants, clinical feedback stimulated negative stereotypes even as it relieved some distress. To actively address internalized stigma, clinicians providing feedback to PR youth must attend to the positive and negative impacts on how youth think about themselves as well as how they feel.

For example, certain retinal ganglion cells, first identified in the salamander, encode the spatial structure of a new image by their first-spike latencies. Here we explore how this temporal code can be used by downstream neural circuits for computing complex features of the image that are not available from the signals of individual ganglion cells. To this end, we feed the experimentally observed spike trains from a population of retinal ganglion cells to an integrate-and-fire model of post-synaptic integration. The synaptic weights of this integration are tuned according to the recently introduced tempotron learning rule. We find that this model neuron can perform complex visual detection tasks in a single synaptic stage that would require multiple stages for neurons operating instead on neural spike counts. Furthermore, the model computes rapidly, using only a single spike per afferent, and can signal its decision in turn by just a single spike. Extending these analyses to large ensembles of simulated retinal signals, we show that the model can detect the orientation of a visual pattern independent of its phase, an operation thought to be one of the primitives in early visual processing. We analyze how these computations work and compare the performance of this model to other schemes for reading out spike-timing information. These results demonstrate that the retina formats spatial information into temporal spike sequences in a way that favors computation in the time domain. Moreover, complex image analysis can be achieved already by a simple integrate-and-fire model neuron, emphasizing the power and plausibility of rapid neural computing with spike times.

To identify life transitions likely to impact diabetes self-care among young adults with Type 1 diabetes and their coping strategies during transition events. Background. Relationships among psychosocial stress, adjustment, coping and metabolic control affect clinical outcomes and mental health. Life transitions represent major change and are associated with stress that temporarily affects individuals' problem-solving, coping abilities and blood glucose levels. Design. A qualitative interpretive inquiry. Method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 young adults with Type 1 diabetes and a constant comparative analysis method. Data and analysis was managed using QSR (c) NVrvo 7 software. Results. Participants identified two significant transition groups: life development associated with adolescence, going through the education system, entering new relationships, motherhood and the workforce and relocating. Diabetes-related transitions included being diagnosed, developing diabetes complications, commencing insulin pump treatment and going on diabetes camps. Participants managed transitions using 'strategic thinking and planning' with strategies of 'self-negotiation to minimise risks'; 'managing diabetes using previous experiences'; 'connecting with others with diabetes'; 'actively seeing information to 'patch' knowledge gaps'; and 'putting diabetes into perspective'. Conclusions. Several strategies are used to manage diabetes during transitions. Thinking and planning strategically was integral to glycaemic control and managing transitions. The impact of transitions on diabetes needs to be explored in larger and longitudinal studies to identify concrete strategies that assist diabetes care during life transitions. Relevance to clinical practice. It is important for health professionals to understand the emotional, social and cognitive factors operating during transitions to assist young adults with Type 1 diabetes to achieve good health outcomes by prioritising goals and plan flexible, timely, individualised and collaborative treatment.

A comparative study between Slovakia and Romania	BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL			English	Article						Consumer behaviour; Cluster analysis; Honey; Health aspects	CONSUMPTION; CONSUMERS; PRODUCTS; DETERMINANTS; PREFERENCES; BEHAVIOR; QUALITY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate different profiles of honey consumers in Slovakia and Romania by using a segmentation approach, thus supporting honey producers from both countries and promoting the consumption of honey for both food and health benefits. Design/methodology/approach - A paper and online survey was conducted in two representative regions of Slovakia (n = 2,138) and Romania (n = 1,100), between November 2017 and February 2018. By carrying out a two-step cluster analysis, several segments of honey consumers based on consumption patterns, demographic profile, purchasing behaviour and honey preferences were defined. Findings - In both countries, honey is mostly consumed as food product and medicine and the majority of consumers think honey has healing effects. Based on the data, the authors identified similar segments in Slovakia and Romania, in terms of frequency and annual consumption ("maniacs" or "loyal consumers", "regular consumers", "occasional consumers" or "sporadic consumers" and "irregular consumers"), but, at the same time, those segments are different in terms of the way in which honey is consumed (multipurpose or direct consumption, spreads, beverages and ingredients for cooking).

Engineering Epigenetic Regulation Using Synthetic Read-Write Modules	CELL			English	Article							DNA METHYLATION; CHROMATIN; EPIGENOME; DYNAMICS; HETEROCHROMATIN; INHERITANCE; TRANSCRIPTION; SUBSTRATE; LANGUAGE; COMPLEX	Chemical modifications to DNA and histone proteins are involved in epigenetic programs underlying cellular differentiation and development. Regulatory networks involving molecular writers and readers of chromatin marks are thought to control these programs. Guided by this common principle, we established an orthogonal epigenetic regulatory system in mammalian cells using N6-methyladenine (m6A), a DNA modification not commonly found in metazoan epigenomes. Our system utilizes synthetic factors that write and read m6A and consequently recruit transcriptional regulators to control reporter loci. Inspired by models of chromatin spreading and epigenetic inheritance, we used our system and mathematical models to construct regulatory circuits that induce m6A-dependent transcriptional states, promote their spatial propagation, and maintain epigenetic memory of the states. These minimal circuits were able to program epigenetic functions de novo, conceptually validating "read-write" architectures. This work provides a toolkit for investigating models of epigenetic regulation and encoding additional layers of epigenetic information in cells.

Natural scenes in tactile texture	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						texture perception; skin oscillations; somatosensory periphery	ROUGHNESS DISCRIMINATION; EPIDERMAL RIDGES; PERCEPTUAL SPACE; FINGER TIPS; HUMAN HAND; FREQUENCY; MECHANISMS; VIBRATION; RESPONSES; TOUCH	Sensory systems are designed to extract behaviorally relevant information from the environment. In seeking to understand a sensory system, it is important to understand the environment within which it operates. In the present study, we seek to characterize the natural scenes of tactile texture perception. During tactile exploration complex high-frequency vibrations are elicited in the fingertip skin, and these vibrations are thought to carry information about the surface texture of manipulated objects. How these texture-elicited vibrations depend on surface microgeometry and on the biomechanical properties of the fingertip skin itself remains to be elucidated. Here we record skin vibrations, using a laser-Doppler vibrometer, as various textured surfaces are scanned across the finger. We find that the frequency composition of elicited vibrations is texture specific and highly repeatable. In fact, textures can be classified with high accuracy on the basis of the vibrations they elicit in the skin. As might be expected, some aspects of surface microgeometry are directly reflected in the skin vibrations. However, texture vibrations are also determined in part by fingerprint geometry. This mechanism enhances textural features that are too small to be resolved spatially, given the limited spatial resolution of the neural signal. We conclude that it is impossible to understand the neural basis of texture perception without first characterizing the skin vibrations that drive neural responses, given the complex dependence of skin vibrations on both surface microgeometry and fingertip biomechanics.

J	Pereira, DP; Hirata, C; Nadjm-Tehrani, S				Pereira, Daniel Patrick; Hirata, Celso; Nadjm-Tehrani, Simin			A STAMP-based ontology approach to support safety and security analyses	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Safety assessment; Security assessment; Security ontology; STAMP/STPA-Sec		Considerations of safety and security in the early stage of system life cycle are essential to collect and prioritize operation needs, determine feasibility of the desired system, and identify technology gaps. Experts from many disciplines are needed to perform the safety and security analyses, ensuring that a system has the necessary attributes. Safety assessment is usually conducted in the concept stage. On the order hand, security assessment is performed in design stage usually when an initial architecture along with the logical and physical components are defined. Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a new hazard analysis technique based on systems thinking and is built on top of a new causality model of accident, which stands for Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP), grounded in systems theory. STPA for Security (STPA-Sec) is an extension of STPA that proposes to include security concerns into the analysis. STPA-Sec helps identifying some hazardous control actions, causal scenarios, and casual factors; however, no emphasis is placed on security threat scenarios. In this paper we propose an ontology-based technique that extends STPA-Sec to improve identification of causal scenarios and associated casual factors, specifically those related to security. We propose an approach that assists safety and security experts conducting safety and security analyses using STPA-Sec with a supporting ontology. First, we present an ontology representing the safety and security knowledge through STPA-Sec process, and provide a tool that implements the proposed ontology. We then propose a process to capture safety and security knowledge into the proposed ontology to identify causal scenarios. We perform a preliminary evaluation of the ontology and the process using an aeronautic case study. The results show that the ontology-based approach helps systems engineers to identify more security scenarios compared to the case where they use only STPA-Sec. Furthermore, some hazardous control actions are not addressed if the systems engineer uses the basic STPA-Sec. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Preschool physics: Using the invisible property of weight in causal reasoning tasks	PLOS ONE			English	Article							YOUNG-CHILDREN; RELATIONAL COMPLEXITY; BALANCE SCALE; INFANTS; 2-YEAR-OLDS; EVENTS; INFORMATION; 3-YEAR-OLDS; IMITATION; BLICKETS	Causal reasoning is an important aspect of scientific thinking. Even young human children can use causal reasoning to explain observations, make predictions, and design actions to bring about specific outcomes in the physical world. Weight is an interesting type of cause because it is an invisible property. Here, we tested preschool children with causal problem solving tasks that assessed their understanding of weight. In an experimental setting, 2-to 5-year-old children completed three different tasks in which they had to use weight to produce physical effects an object displacement task, a balance-scale task, and a tower building task. The results showed that the children's understanding of how to use object weight to produce specific object-tod-object causal outcomes improved as a function of age, with 4- and 5-year-olds showing above-chance performance on all three tasks. The younger children's performance was more variable. The pattern of results provides theoretical insights into which aspects of weight processing are particularly difficult for preschool children and why they find it difficult.

Rapid information system advances have created a vast opportunity of secondary data sources for information to enhance the situational and health status awareness of populations. While the field of medical informatics and initiatives to standardize healthcare-seeking encounter records continue accelerating, it is necessary to adapt analytic and statistical methodologies to mature in sync with sibling information science technologies. One major right-of-passage for statistical inference is to advance the optimal application of analytic methodologies for using multiple data streams in detecting and characterizing public health population events of importance. This report first describes the problem in general and the data context, then delineates more specifically the practical nature of the problem and the related issues. Approaches currently applied to data with time-series, statistical process control and traditional inference concepts are described with examples in the section on Statistics and the Role of the Analytic Surveillance Data Monitor. These are the techniques that are providing substance to surveillance professionals and enabling use of multiple data streams. The next section describes use of a more complex approach that takes temporal as well as spatial dimensionsinto consideration for detection and situational awareness regarding event distributions. The space-time statistic has successfully been used to detect and track public health events of interest. Important research questions which are summarized at the end of this report are described in more detail with respect to the methodological application in the respective sections. This was thought to help elucidate the research requirements as summarized later in the report. Following the description of the space-time scan statistical application; this report extends to a less traditional area of promise given what has been observed in recent application of analytic methods. Bayesian networks (BNs) represent a conceptual step with advantages of flexibility for the public health surveillance community. Progression from traditional to the more extending statistical concepts in the context of the dynamic status quo of responsibility and challenge, leads to a conclusion consisting of categorical research needs. The report is structured by design to inform judgment about how to build on practical systems to achieve better analytic outcomes for public health surveillance. There are references to research issues throughout the sections with a summarization at the end, which also includes items previously unmentioned in the report.

A critical step in this process is the identification of existing barriers to effective collaboration, finding new areas of common ground, and ways to enhance co-operation with regards to CCA and DRR policymaking in Europe. This is particularly important considering the potential relationships between CCA and DRR activities at the regional, national, European and global levels. Serious games have emerged as a valuable tool to communicate information and catalyse discussion in many policy arenas. The games have the power to inform, mainly by exposing strengths and weaknesses of a system but not necessarily create policy choices. This paper presents the development process and rationale behind creation of RAMSETE I, a serious game developed by and for the ESPREssO Project to elicit information from its stakeholders in aiming to inform synergies between CCA and DRR sectors. The results assess its application as a device to frame discussions during an international Think Tank workshop. The serious game focused on three particular aspects of CCA and DRR policy interactions: (1) separation of administrative responsibilities and the use of different terminology, (2) the ongoing competition for funding and political will as well as (3) difficulties regarding the top-down implementation of policies. The rules and design process are presented briefly, before going in-depth into the information gleaned during its application in the workshop.

Design/setting/subjects: The study was a descriptive epidemiological study. Analysis was performed on 5280 deliveries admitted to twelve member hospitals of the National Collaborative Perinatal Neonatal Network during the period September 2003-January 2005. Information on folic acid intake and maternal and neonatal characteristics were obtained from obstetric charts along with direct interviews performed by trained personnel. Logistic regression was performed to determine the predictors of preconceptional folic acid Use. Results: The overall use of preconceptional folic acid supplementation was 14.0% (18.6% in urban hospitals v. 2.7% in rural hospitals). Higher socio-economic status, lower parity and having a history of previous spontaneous abortions were significantly associated with preconceptional folic acid Use.

BackgroundCytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) affects the patient's recovery. The hospital stay is long, and it is important to study how patients experience their health postoperatively. DesignQualitative descriptive design. MethodsBetween January-May 2012, individual interviews were conducted with 20 patients in a university hospital in central Sweden using a semi-structured interview guide. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. ResultsThree themes (a process, body and mind, and support) and nine categories emerged. The surgery was described as a turning point, followed by a period of hope and thankfulness. Nevertheless, patients had difficulty taking in their positive feelings because they were overwhelmed by their bodily ailments. Despite the patients' descriptions of being on an emotional roller coaster, thinking about death and an uncertain future, or being in a state somewhere between sleep and wakefulness, they described themselves as being in good mental health. Continuous individualised information and support from the surgeon and staff members were described as being important for the recovery process, and none of the patients asked for counselling before discharge. ConclusionSurgery was described as a turning point followed by an uncertain future. Despite the overwhelming nature of their bodily ailments and being on an emotional roller coaster postoperatively, patients described themselves as being in good psychological health and not needing any professional counselling. Continuous individualised information from the surgeon and staff members played an important role in the recovery process. Relevance to clinical practiceBoth staff and future patients may benefit from the patients' experiences after CRS and HIPEC described in this study. The knowledge gained from this study could be used in designing a care plan for future patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC.

J	Sartori, L; Theodorou, A				Sartori, Laura; Theodorou, Andreas			A sociotechnical perspective for the future of AI: narratives, inequalities, and human control	ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Sociology; Accountability; Transparency; Narratives; Inequalities; Human control	ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; TRANSPARENCY; SOCIOLOGY; MACHINES; SOCIETY; DESIGN	Different people have different perceptions about artificial intelligence (AI). It is extremely important to bring together all the alternative frames of thinking-from the various communities of developers, researchers, business leaders, policymakers, and citizens-to properly start acknowledging AI. This article highlights the 'fruitful collaboration' that sociology and AI could develop in both social and technical terms. We discuss how biases and unfairness are among the major challenges to be addressed in such a sociotechnical perspective. First, as intelligent machines reveal their nature of 'magnifying glasses' in the automation of existing inequalities, we show how the AI technical community is calling for transparency and explainability, accountability and contestability. Not to be considered as panaceas, they all contribute to ensuring human control in novel practices that include requirement, design and development methodologies for a fairer AI. Second, we elaborate on the mounting attention for technological narratives as technology is recognized as a social practice within a specific institutional context. Not only do narratives reflect organizing visions for society, but they also are a tangible sign of the traditional lines of social, economic, and political inequalities. We conclude with a call for a diverse approach within the AI community and a richer knowledge about narratives as they help in better addressing future technical developments, public debate, and policy. AI practice is interdisciplinary by nature and it will benefit from a socio-technical perspective.

The algorithm exploits the evaluation time gradient in addition to the convergence gradient attempting to reach the same convergence precision following a more economical path. The particle's newly incorporated time information is usually in contradiction to the past memories of best function evaluations thus degrading convergence. A technique is proposed in order to modulate the new cognitive input that consists of progressive reducing of its weight in order to confer the algorithm the appropriate time-convergence balance. Results show that the proposed algorithm not only provides computational economy, but also unexpectedly improves convergence per se due to a better exploration in the initial stages of optimization. Its application in asymptotic homogenization of a cracked poroelastic medium confirms its superior performance compared to a series of alternative optimization algorithms. The proposed algorithm improvement allows to extend the applicability of PSO and PSO-based algorithms to problems that were previously thought to be too computationally expensive for population-based approaches.

Gym lifestyle factors and male reproductive health: a study into young adult usage and perceptions	REPRODUCTIVE BIOMEDICINE ONLINE			English	Article						Gym supplements; Lifestyle impacts; Male fertility; Male reproductive health; Qualitative study	SEMEN QUALITY; FERTILITY; INFERTILITY; MEN; KNOWLEDGE; AWARENESS; AGE	Research question: What level of awareness do young adults have regarding the potential impacts of gym lifestyle factors and supplementation on male infertility?Design: Between February and March 2023 a questionnaire (n =153) was employed to gauge attitudes to and awareness of the effects of male reproductive health and gym lifestyles on male fertility. Two semi-structured focus groups (n =10 total), stratified by sex assigned at birth, were conducted using a set of discussion topics.Results: The survey revealed a statistically significant difference between male and female awareness of the potential impacts of some forms of high-intensity exercise and protein supplementation on male reproductive health (P = 0.045). Many men do not think about fertility unprompted; the survey revealed that fewer men have thought about their fertility compared with those who are curious about their fertility (P = 4.7 x 10(-5)) and those who believe their personal fertility is important to them (P = 8.1 x 10(-6)). Men were more likely to make a change in their behaviour if it had a long-term compared with a short-term effect on their fertility (P < 10(-5)). Five focus group themes surrounding awareness of male reproductive health were extracted.Conclusions: This work has shown that there is a significant lack of awareness and information surrounding the effects of gym lifestyles on male infertility in a young adult UK population. Crucially, levels of awareness differ significantly between men and women. Men have a potentially alarming lack of concern over their own fertility and how factors such as gym supplements can have negative long-term impacts.

Here we investigate whether SEZs exceed industry enclaves by bringing the literature on the geography of innovation into dialogue with that on industry enclaves. Drawing upon detailed information on the geographical boundaries of these SEZs and a database of geocoded Chinese patents, we analyse the economic geography of technological collaboration between SEZs in China's Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou (SWC) metropolitan area. Overall, we find that: (1) enterprises in SEZs account for 55.6% of the region's total patents and 75.4% of its co-patents; (2) knowledge linkages within and between SEZs in the SWC metropolitan area are quite limited and most of the knowledge linkages are beyond the region; and (3) there is considerable heterogeneity between SEZs in terms of their knowledge linkages, with multinational and domestic enterprises playing different roles.

We compared three conditions varying in motion predictability and assessed the effect of anticipation on subsequent illness ratings using a within-subjects design. Background: Anticipation is thought to play a role in motion sickness by reducing the discrepancy between sensed and expected sensory information. However, both the exact role and potential magnitude of anticipation on motion sickness are unknown. Method: Participants (N = 17) were exposed to three 15-min conditions consisting of repeated fore-aft motion on a sled on a 40-m rail (1) at constant intervals and consistent motion direction, (2) at constant intervals but varied motion direction, and (3) at varied intervals but consistent motion direction. Conditions were otherwise identical in motion intensity and displacement, as they were composed of the same repetitions of identical blocks of motion. Illness ratings were recorded at 1-min intervals using an 11-point motion sickness scale. Results: Average illness ratings after exposure were significantly lower for the predictable condition, compared with both the directionally unpredictable condition and the temporally unpredictable condition. Conclusion: Unpredictable motion is significantly more provocative compared with predictable motion. Findings suggest motion sickness results from a discrepancy between sensed and expected motion, rather than from unpreparedness to motion. Application: This study underlines the importance of an individual's anticipation to motion in motion sickness. Furthermore, this knowledge could be used in domains such as that of autonomous vehicles to reduce carsickness.

Hulshoff			Topology of genetic associations between regional gray matter volume and intellectual ability: Evidence for a high capacity network	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Twin; Heritability; Intelligence; Gray matter; Connectivity	HUMAN BRAIN STRUCTURE; WHITE-MATTER; GENERAL INTELLIGENCE; COGNITIVE-ABILITIES; P-FIT; ARCHITECTURE; DISTORTIONS; EFFICIENCY; THICKNESS; SCIENCE	Intelligence is associated with a network of distributed gray matter areas including the frontal and parietal higher association cortices and primary processing areas of the temporal and occipital lobes. Efficient information transfer between gray matter regions implicated in intelligence is thought to be critical for this trait to emerge. Genetic factors implicated in intelligence and gray matter may promote a high capacity for information transfer. Whether these genetic factors act globally or on local gray matter areas separately is not known. Brain maps of phenotypic and genetic associations between gray matter volume and intelligence were made using structural equation modeling of 3 T MRI T1-weighted scans acquired in 167 adult twins of the newly acquired U-TWIN cohort. Subsequently, structural connectivity analyses (DTI) were performed to test the hypothesis that gray matter regions associated with intellectual ability form a densely connected core. Gray matter regions associated with intellectual ability were situated in the right prefrontal, bilateral temporal, bilateral parietal, right occipital and subcortical regions. Regions implicated in intelligence had high structural connectivity density compared to 10,000 reference networks (p = 0.031). The genetic association with intelligence was for 39% explained by a genetic source unique to these regions (independent of total brain volume), this source specifically implicated the right supramarginal gyrus. Using a twin design, we show that intelligence is genetically represented in a spatially distributed and densely connected network of gray matter regions providing a high capacity infrastructure. Although genes for intelligence have overlap with those for total brain volume, we present evidence that there are genes for intelligence that act specifically on the subset of brain areas that form an efficient brain network.

J	Zhou, JW; Huang, Y; Cheng, CY; Wang, K; Wu, RB				Zhou, Jingwei; Huang, Yue; Cheng, Chunyan; Wang, Kai; Wu, Ruibo			Intrinsic Dynamics of the Binding Rail and Its Allosteric Effect in the Class I Histone Deacetylases	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							T-CELL LYMPHOMA; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; MECHANICAL METHODS; HYDROXAMIC ACID; HDAC INHIBITORS; FORCE-FIELD; DENSITY; QM/MM; SAHA	The development of novel isoform/class-selective inhibitors is still of great biological and medical significance to conquer the continuously reported side effects for the histone deacetylase (HDAC) drugs. The first potent HDAC allosteric inhibitor was discovered last year, and this allosteric inhibitor design is thought to be a promising strategy to overcome the current challenges in HDAC inhibitor design. However, the detailed allosteric mechanism and its remote regulatory effects on the catalytic/inhibitor activity of HDAC are still unclear. In this work, on the basis of microsecond-time-scale all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and picosecond-time-scale density functional theory/molecular mechanics MD simulations on HDAC8, we propose that the allostery is achieved by the intrinsic conformational flexibility of the binding rail (constituted by a highly conserved X-D residue dyad), which steers the loop loop motion and creates the diverse shapes of the allosteric sites in different HDAC isoforms. Additionally,, the rotatability of the binding rail is an inherent structural feature that regulates the hydrophobicity of the linker binding channel and thus further affects the HDAC enzyme inhibitory/catalytic activity by utilizing the promiscuity of X-D dyad. Since the plastic X residue is different among class I HDACs, these new findings provide a deeper understanding of the allostery, which is guidable for the design of new allosteric inhibitors toward the allosteric site and structure modifications on the conventional inhibitors binding into the active pocket by exploiting the intrinsic dynamic features of the conserved X-D dyad.

Tinnitus: current understanding and contemporary management	CURRENT OPINION IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY & HEAD AND NECK SURGERY			English	Article						clinical evaluation; etiology; otology; tinnitus; treatment	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DOUBLE-BLIND TRIAL; GINKGO-BILOBA; HEARING-LOSS; EXCITABILITY; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; PREVALENCE; EFFICACY; DESIGN; MOTOR	Purpose of review Tinnitus is a debilitating condition that affects a broad range of patients. Despite thorough and extensive research, the cause of tinnitus has yet to be determined. Also, there has never been a single intervention identified that can consistently eliminate the symptoms of tinnitus. However, despite our inability to 'cure' tinnitus, there are many medical and behavioral strategies that may result in symptomatic relief. The purpose of this article is to review some of the previous information on tinnitus and to examine the recent research on the etiology and management of this condition. Recent findings Recent research into the etiology of tinnitus has demonstrated that genetics plays less of a role than previously thought. Although many medications can cause some relief of tinnitus, a number of well designed studies have failed to identify a single cure. For patients with severe tinnitus who have failed other treatments, such as dietary modification, herbs and nutrients, sound therapies (tinnitus retraining, Neuromonics, masking, and others), or centrally acting medications, transcranial magnetic stimulation has emerged as a viable treatment option. Summary Tinnitus is a common medical complaint and debilitating problem for some patients. It has a broad range of etiologies and even more potential treatments. This review is meant to inform the reader on the current options available to treat this condition.

Evidence-based educational and refusal skills training materials were adapted, and game design elements were applied to clinically and scientifically informed scenarios in which opioids are typically introduced to adolescents using standard product development methods to create the SafeUse prototype.Materials and Methods: In a mixed-methods study, 14 adolescents were assessed on their knowledge and perceptions of opioids before and following 5-7 days of access to SafeUse. Participants provided feedback in focus groups on the acceptability, relevance, and understandability of SafeUse and made suggestions for its improvement. Feedback was coded and summarized as to playability, acceptability, appropriateness, content development, and knowledge transfer. Pre- and post-access quantitative data were analyzed using Wilcoxon matched pairs signed-rank tests.Results: Overall, participants liked SafeUse, its characters, graphics, and approach, finding it more appealing than lectures/reading materials and appropriate for school settings. They moderately to extremely "liked the game," "would like to play more game modules," "liked playing through the decisions," thought the game was realistic/relevant and fun, and they learned new information about opioids. Participants reported increased confidence to refuse opioids and decreased likelihood of accepting opioids from someone they know. Knowledge about opioids increased (P < 0.006), and adolescent perception that prescription drugs are safer than illegal drugs decreased (P < 0.003) after playing SafeUse.Conclusion: Findings suggest that SafeUse is acceptable and likely educational to adolescents and worthy of further development and research.

Although providing diagnostic, actionable feedback is generally more effective, in current practice, feedback is often given in the form of a simple proportion of correctly solved items. This study shows the validation process of constructing detailed diagnostic information on a set of skills, abilities, and cognitive processes (so-called attributes) from students' item response data with diagnostic classification models. Attribute measurement in the domain of statistics education is validated based on both expert judgment and empirical student data from a think-aloud study and large-scale assessment administration. The constructed assessments provide a valid and reliable measurement of the attributes. Inferences that can be drawn from the results of these formative assessments are discussed and it is demonstrated how this information can be communicated to students via learning dashboards to allow them to make more effective learning choices.

Application of system dynamics and participatory spatial group model building in animal health: A case study of East Coast Fever interventions in Lundazi and Monze districts of Zambia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CENTRAL PROVINCE; THEILERIA-PARVA; CONTROL STRATEGIES; SANGA CATTLE; DISEASES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ECONOMICS; IMPACTS; AFRICA	East Coast Fever (ECF) is the most economically important production disease among traditional beef cattle farmers in Zambia. Despite the disease control efforts by the government, donors, and farmers, ECF cases are increasing. Why does ECF oscillate over time? Can alternative approaches such as systems thinking contribute solutions to the complex ECF problem, avoid unintended consequences, and achieve sustainable results? To answer these research questions and inform the design and implementation of ECF interventions, we qualitatively investigated the influence of dynamic socio-economic, cultural, and ecological factors. We used system dynamics modelling to specify these dynamics qualitatively, and an innovative participatory framework called spatial group model building (SGMB). SGMB uses participatory geographical information system (GIS) concepts and techniques to capture the role of spatial phenomenon in the context of complex systems, allowing stakeholders to identify spatial phenomenon directly on physical maps and integrate such information in model development. Our SGMB process convened focus groups of beef value chain stakeholders in two distinct production systems. The focus groups helped to jointly construct a series of interrelated system dynamics models that described ECF in a broader systems context. Thus, a complementary objective of this study was to demonstrate the applicability of system dynamics modelling and SGMB in animal health. The SGMB process revealed policy leverage points in the beef cattle value chain that could be targeted to improve ECF control. For example, policies that develop sustainable and stable cattle markets and improve household income availability may have positive feedback effects on investment in animal health. The results obtained from a SGMB process also demonstrated that a "one-size-fits-all" approach may not be equally effective in policing ECF in different agro-ecological zones due to the complex interactions of socio-ecological context with important, and often ignored, spatial patterns.

Methods We conducted a desktop analysis of eight public health competency frameworks publicly available on the internet. Using a pre-formed template, competency statements from each framework were mapped against the elements of the Global Charter-core public health services (Protection, Promotion and Prevention) and overarching enabling functions (Information, Governance, Capacity, and Advocacy). We then quantified coverage of the Charter's elements in each of the frameworks. Results We found that although the public health competency frameworks vary considerably in terms of coverage and focus, they all cover every element contained in the Global Charter. However, there were a number of areas of competency identified in some frameworks not explicitly referred to in the Charter including cultural safety, human rights and systems thinking. Conclusions The Global Charter provides a mechanism for comparing competency sets, checking public health curricula content, informing competency framework and curricula (re)design, and planning and monitoring workforce needs.

Introduction: Dupytren's contracture is thought to result in digital impairments and performance disabilities. No study to date has focused on how patients with Dupuytren's contracture experience limitations in daily activities and the results after surgery. Purpose of the Study: Describe which activities patients with Dupuytren's contracture defined as the most disabling, how they rated their activity limitations and determine the relationship between activity limitations and digital extension before and three months after surgery and postoperative hand therapy. Methods: Self-reported rating of activity limitations, performance, and measures of total digital extension. Results: The most disabling activities were with self-care (42%), though overall performance was significantly improved following surgery and postoperative hand therapy. The total digital extension was significantly improved 81 degrees and was positively related to performance. Conclusions: The results provide new information about activities that patients with Dupuytren's contracture experience as being difficult to perform and describes positive changes in performance and range of motion.

Design/methodology/approach - The source of sample comes from the Science & Technology Parks database, a major association of corporate information of new technology ventures in Iran. The sampling frame comprises a wide range of industry segments including electronics, chemicals, agriculture, computer equipment, pharmaceuticals and medicines, telecommunication equipment, and others. The author used the conventional method of back-translation to translate the measures from English to Persian. There were 380 NTVs that the author could reach to send the survey. Among 380 NTVs, 177 entrepreneurs fully completed all the items (46 percent response rate). Findings - The findings showed that what might decrease the state uncertainty perception, at same time it can give arise to other types of uncertainty. Thus, the result confirmed that the three types of uncertainty are differentiable. Research limitations/implications - In the study, the author used cross-sectional self-report data, which cannot suggest causal relationships very well. Practical implications - Investigating factors that influence the perception of environmental uncertainty may help explain why organizations, under the same environment, can behave heterogeneously. Originality/value - By providing a clear picture about the relationship between market with network effect and perception of environmental uncertainty, this study contributes to the theoretical and empirical understanding of the emergence of environmental uncertainty perception.

Distributed Coordination Control for Multi-Robot Networks Using Lyapunov-Like Barrier Functions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL			English	Article						Lyapunov; Nagumo's theorem	COVERAGE CONTROL; FLOCKING; SYSTEMS; AGENTS; AVOIDANCE	This paper addresses the problem of multi-agent coordination and control under multiple objectives, and presents a set-theoretic formulation amenable to Lyapunov-based analysis and control design. A novel class of Lyapunov-like barrier functions is introduced and used to encode multiple, non-trivial control objectives, such as collision avoidance, proximity maintenance and convergence to desired destinations. The construction is based on recentered barrier functions and on maximum approximation functions. Thus, a single Lyapunov-like function is used to encode the constrained set of each agent, yielding simple, gradient-based control solutions. The derived control strategies are distributed, i.e., based on information locally available to each agent, which is dictated by sensing and communication limitations. Furthermore, the proposed coordination protocol dictates semi-cooperative conflict resolution among agents, which can be also thought as prioritization, as well as conflict resolution with respect to an agent (the leader) which is not actively participating in collision avoidance, except when necessary. The considered scenario is pertinent to surveillance tasks and involves nonholonomic vehicles. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through simulation results.

The purpose was to prioritize ecological risks systematically and consistently in relation to policy goals agreed by the SG. Scientists listed and advised on ecosystem components, their units (individual species, stocks, habitats, or communities) and attributes, as well as agents of change in the SW, their activities, and generalized effects relevant to the policy goals. A working group (WG) of fishers, fishery observers, technical advisors, and marine scientists paired each unit with the activity thought most likely to impact the most sensitive policy goal, then scored risk according to defined rules spatially, temporally, and as intensity and duration of effects. The geometric mean of the four scores, slightly adjusted for unscored factors if necessary, was the relative impact score (RIS). With this standardized method, the main aspects of risk were considered separately and independently, thereby assisting objective prioritization. Nineteen unit-activity pairs were listed as priority risks (RIS > 3) in the SW region during a 2-d meeting that fully exploited the wide range of information and experience available at the WG. Socio-economics was not considered. The ERS for the SW was designed to be compatible with other similar ERSs that might be carried out for neighbouring marine regions. ERS can minimize extra monitoring needed for ecosystem management and, in principle, collaborating non-fishery agents of change could be included. By engaging all stakeholders in the setting of initial priorities for action and by assembling all available sources of information, ERS offers a useful starting point for holistic ecosystem management.

J	Glicksman, RL; Page, J				Glicksman, Robert L.; Page, Jarryd			ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT AND NEPA: HOW TO RECONCILE PREDICTIVE ASSESSMENT IN THE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FLEXIBILITY	HARVARD ENVIRONMENTAL LAW REVIEW			English	Article							DATA GAPS; INFORMATION; SCIENCE; POLICY	For years, public lands scholars lamented the limited success that federal agencies had in applying adaptive management decision-making processes in pursuit of their natural resource management responsibilities. Agency duties to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA") have played a role in creating a disconnect between the theory and application of adaptive management. NEPA was designed to force agencies to predict (and consider ways to avoid) the adverse environmental impacts of actions before committing to them. Adaptive management is built on the premise that, at least in conditions of uncertainty such as those that often characterize natural resource management, acting on the basis of one-time predictive judgments is a prescription for failure. Instead, resource managers need to continuously track the consequences of their decisions, reevaluate their management approaches based on evolving evidence, and make appropriate adjustments before starting this iterative process anew. Not with standing the tension between the decision-making approaches reflected in NEPA and adaptive management, the federal land management agencies have had to figure out how to implement their NEPA responsibilities as they have increasingly resorted to adaptive management strategies. This Article analyzes the inevitable litigation that these efforts have spurred, identifying how courts have applied various aspects of NEPA's mandates to an agency that resorts to adaptive management. This analysis reveals that careful attention to NEPA's requirements reconciliation of the tension between NEPA and adaptive management possible. The Article gleans a series of best practices that should allow agencies to benefit from the flexibility that adaptive management affords its practitioners while satisfying NEPA's "stop and think" mandates.

Evaluation of clinicians' knowledge and practices regarding medical radiological exposure: findings from a mixed-methods investigation (survey and qualitative study)	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							RADIATION-EXPOSURE; CT SCANS; RISK; AWARENESS; PATIENT; BENEFIT	Objectives: To assess the impact of initiatives aiming to increase clinician awareness of radiation exposure; to explore the challenges they face when communicating with patients; to study what they think is the most appropriate way of communicating the long-term potential risks of medical radiological exposure to patients. Design: A quantitative and qualitative evaluation through a survey and focal groups. Setting: San Juan Hospital and Dr Peset Hospital (Southeast Spain) and clinicians from Spanish scientific societies. Participants: The surveys were answered (a) in person (216: all the radiologists (30), urologists (14) and surgeons (44) working at both participant hospitals; a sample of general practitioners from the catchment area of one hospital (45), and a consecutive sample of radiologists attending a scientific meeting (60)) or (b) electronically through Spanish scientific societies (299: radiologists (45), pneumologists (123), haematologists (75) and surgeons (40)). Clinicians were not randomly selected and thus the results are limited by the diligence of the individuals filling out the survey. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Clinicians' knowledge and practices regarding medical radiological exposure, and what they considered most appropriate for communicating information to patients. Results: Nearly 80% of the clinicians surveyed had never heard of the European recommendations. Fewer than 20% of the clinicians surveyed identified correctly the radiation equivalence dose of intravenous urography or barium enema. It was reported by 31.7% that they inform patients about the long-term potential risks of ionising radiation. All participants agreed that the most appropriate way to present information is a table with a list of imaging tests and their corresponding radiation equivalence dose in terms of chest X-rays and background radiation exposure. Conclusions: Medical radiological exposure is frequently underestimated and rarely explained to patients. With a clear understanding of medical radiological exposure and proper communication tools, clinicians will be able to accurately inform patients.

Parents and GPs' understandings and beliefs about food allergy testing in children with eczema: qualitative interview study within the Trial of Eczema allergy Screening Tests (TEST) feasibility trial	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						eczema; parents; diet; child; primary care practice; allergens; qualitative	MANAGING CHILDHOOD ECZEMA; KNOWLEDGE; EXPERIENCES; DIET	Aim To explore parent and general practitioner (GP) understanding and beliefs about food allergy testing for children with eczema. Design and setting Qualitative interview study in UK primary care within the Trial of Eczema allergy Screening Tests feasibility trial. Participants Semi-structured interviews with parents of children with eczema taking part in the feasibility study and GPs at practices hosting the study. Results 21 parents and 11 GPs were interviewed. Parents discussed a range of potential causes for eczema, including a role for food allergy. They believed allergy testing to be beneficial as it could potentially identify a cure or help reduce symptoms and they found negative tests reassuring, suggesting to them that no dietary changes were needed. GPs reported limited experience and uncertainty regarding food allergy in children with eczema. While some GPs believed referral for allergy testing could be appropriate, most were unclear about its utility. They thought it should be reserved for children with severe eczema or complex problems but wanted more information to advise parents and help guide decision making. Conclusions Parents' motivations for allergy testing are driven by the desire to improve their child's condition and exclude food allergy as a possible cause of symptoms. GPs are uncertain about the role of allergy testing and want more information about its usefulness to support parents and help inform decision making.

Therefore, the binding features need to be elucidated when chemistry researchers study new molecules (metal complexes) to be used as drugs. This paper concerns the experimental and data treatment aspects of the mechanistic analysis of the binding to a fluorescent protein (the golden standard serum albumin) by using direct fluorescence titrations. Fluorescence data are not rarely only qualitatively used, neglecting further treatments which could offer a precious detailed picture of the behavior of the drug. We aim to spread a mechanistic approach, discussing the critical aspects for correctly designing the experiments and treating the data. The researcher may confirm adduct formation and evaluate binding constants (Stern-Volmer KSV or other types of K). Also, we discuss here, with the help of literature examples, the correct use of temperature dependence of K to extract thermodynamic parameters, comment on enthalpy-entropy compensation, together with the use of synchronous spectra and exchange experiments to gain information on the binding type and site. We think that this tutorial/critical synopsis can be of help for the increasing community dealing with these experiments, which are valuable but often much more tricky than it might appear at first sight.

Over the past two decades, the illness trajectories of children with life-limiting conditions have extended with new treatments and better home-based care. Future planning is a critically under-researched aspect of children's palliative care globally. This paper describes the development, implementation and evaluation of innovative child and parent-held palliative care planning resources. The resources were designed to facilitate parent and child thinking and engagement in future planning, and to determine care preferences and preferred locations of care for children with life-limiting conditions from diagnosis onwards. These resources fill a significant gap in palliative care planning before the end-of-life phase. Methods: Drawing on contemporaneous research on producing evidence-based children's health information, we collaborated with leading children's not-for-profit organisations, parents, children, and professionals. A set of resources (My Choices booklets) were developed for parents and children and evaluated using interviews (parents, children, professionals) and questionnaires (professionals) and an open web-based consultation. Results: Parents and children responded in three ways: Some used the booklets to produce detailed written plans with clear outcomes and ideas about how best to achieve desired outcomes. Others preferred to use the booklet to help them think about potential options. Remaining parents found it difficult to think about the future and felt there was no point because they perceived there to be no suitable local services. Professionals varied in confidence in their ability to engage with families to plan ahead and identified many challenges that prevented them from doing so. Few families shared their plans with professionals. Parents and children have far stronger preferences for home-care than professionals. Conclusion: The My Choices booklets were revised in light of findings, have been endorsed by Together for Short Lives, and are free to download in English and Welsh for use by parents and young people globally. More work needs to be done to support families who are not yet receptive to planning ahead. Professionals would benefit from more training in person-centred approaches to future planning and additional communications skills to increase confidence and ability to engage with families to deliver sensitive palliative care planning.

J	Orchard, F; Reynolds, S				Orchard, Faith; Reynolds, Shirley			The combined influence of cognitions in adolescent depression: Biases of interpretation, self-evaluation, and memory	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						depression; adolescence; cognition; bias	MAJOR DEPRESSION; SUBCLINICAL DEPRESSION; FEELINGS QUESTIONNAIRE; EMOTIONAL INFORMATION; MENTAL-HEALTH; ATTENTION; CHILDREN; MOOD; HYPOTHESIS; METAANALYSIS	ObjectivesDepression is characterized by a range of systematic negative biases in thinking and information processing. These biases are believed to play a causal role in the aetiology and maintenance of depression, and it has been proposed that the combined effect of cognitive biases may have greater impact on depression than individual biases alone. Yet little is known about how these biases interact during adolescence when onset is most common. MethodsIn this study, adolescents were recruited from the community (n=212) and from a Child And Adolescent Mental Health Service (n=84). Participants completed measures of depressive symptoms, interpretation bias, self-evaluation, and recall memory. These included the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, Ambiguous Scenarios Test for Depression in Adolescents, Self-Description Questionnaire, and an immediate recall task. The clinically referred sample also took part in a formal diagnostic interview. ResultsIndividual cognitive biases were significantly intercorrelated and associated with depression severity. The combination of cognitive biases was a stronger predictor of depression severity than individual biases alone, predicting 60% of the variance in depression severity across all participants. There were two significant predictors, interpretation bias and negative self-evaluation; however, almost all of the variance was explained by negative self-evaluation. ConclusionsThe findings support the interrelationship and additive effect of biases in explaining depression and suggest that understanding the way in which cognitive biases interact could be important in advancing methods of identification, early intervention, and treatment. Practitioner points A combination of biases was a better predictor of depression symptom severity than individual biases. Interpretation and self-evaluation were better predictors of depression symptom severity than recall. Negative self-evaluation was the strongest individual predictor of depression symptom severity. Negative self-evaluation was able to classify depressed from non-depressed adolescents. The cross-sectional design of the study precludes any conclusions about the potential causal role of these variables. Different tasks were used to assess different types of cognitive bias meaning that the possible linear operation along an information processing pathway' could not be examined.

The incentive sensitization theory proposes that conditioned responses are related to increased sensitivity of the reward-related dopaminergic pathways in the brain. However, neuroimaging studies on alcohol cue-reactivity show inconsistent results. Methods: Stimuli content of 26 alcohol cue-reactivity studies was systematically reviewed. Results: No differences were found between alcoholic beverage stimuli and non-alcoholic beverage stimuli in human display and brand factors; however, alcoholic beverage stimuli were more likely to display social interaction compared to non-alcoholic beverage stimuli. Conclusions: Given that processing of social information activates brain areas that partly overlap with reward-related brain areas associated with cue-reactivity, such differences between conditions can introduce noise in the findings. We therefore suggest matching stimuli sets on the reviewed factors carefully to improve reliability of neuroimaging studies investigating alcohol-related cue-reactivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The brain tumor microenvironment (TME) is highly complex and thought to impact treatment resistance and failure. To enable a greater understanding of the milieu of cells in the brain TME, advances in imaging and sequential profiling of proteins/mRNA have given rise to the field of spatial transcriptomics. These technologies provide a greater depth of understanding of the tissue architecture, cellular and spatial profiles, including cellular activation status, which may provide insights into effective therapies for brain cancers. Areas Covered In this review, we provide an overview of spatial profiling technologies at the forefront in the field and describe the applications for brain cancer. Expert opinion Brain tumors are often resistant to treatment, and display both an immunosuppressive and heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. Next-generation imaging and multi-omics technologies are providing a tool for intricately characterizing their tissue biology. This information will aid in the design of effective therapies and begin to provide an understanding of therapy resistance.

Silk fibroin scaffold is considered to be one of the useful materials in/on which chondrocytes can proliferate without dedifferentiating into fibroblast-like cells and can organize a hyaline-like tissue. For the purpose of seeking some useful aspects for designing scaffold, initial adhesive force of chondrocytes to the surface of fibroin substrate was measured by using a lab-made apparatus applying the cantilever beam method. It was found that the adhesive force per unit spreading area of chondrocytes on fibroin substrate had a clear peak between 6 and 12 h after seeding. From the results of immunofluorescence staining for actin and vinculin during this period, it could be thought that an immature formation of actin fibers which was uniquely observed at the periphery of cells attaching to fibroin substrate did not contribute to the increase of adhesive force, Results in this study suggested that surface of the fibroin substrate was gradually covered with some substances which inhibit the adhesion during this period. These cell-material interactions have a possibility to be useful information for designing the adhesive performance of scaffold surface in cartilage regeneration. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang, F; Schoenbaum, G; Kahnt, T				Wang, Fang; Schoenbaum, Geoffrey; Kahnt, Thorsten			Interactions between human orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus support model-based inference	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							COGNITIVE MAP; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEMORY; MECHANISMS; FUTURE; REWARD; REPRESENTATION; IDENTITY; DISTINCT; CONNECTIVITY	Internal representations of relationships between events in the external world can be utilized to infer outcomes when direct experience is lacking. This process is thought to involve the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and hippocampus (HPC), but there is little evidence regarding the relative role of these areas and their interactions in inference. Here, we used a sensory preconditioning task and pattern-based neuroimaging to study this question. We found that associations among value-neutral cues were acquired in both regions during preconditioning but that value-related information was only represented in the OFC at the time of the probe test. Importantly, inference was accompanied by representations of associated cues and inferred outcomes in the OFC, as well as by increased HPC-OFC connectivity. These findings suggest that the OFC and HPC represent only partially overlapping information and that interactions between the two regions support model-based inference.

An Elective Course in Cardiovascular Electrophysiology for Pharmacy Learners	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						arrhythmias; channelopathies; electrocardiograms; antiarrhythmic agents; case-based; note-taking	HANDOUTS	Objective. To implement an integrated, comprehensive, and learner-centered elective course focused at exposing learners to the interpretation of electrocardiograms and highlighting the mechanisms underlining the abnormal electrophysiological events. Design. Learners were presented with foundational information on the mechanisms underlying electrophysiological changes associated with the development of arrhythmias. They then discussed the interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings and diagnosis of cardiovascular events. Teaching formats included "chalk-talk" and didactic sessions, case-based exercises providing hands-on evaluation of ECG recordings, and high-fidelity simulation presenting cases of arrhythmias. The course design emphasized critical thinking, learner engagement, and development of problem-solving skills. Learners were assessed by formal assignments, examinations, and in-class quizzes. Assessment. Learner comprehension of the material was assessed using cumulative examinations, inclass quizzes, assignments, and in-class presentations. Learner evaluations showed that the case-based discussions, practice ECGs, review tables, and illustrations enhanced course performance and retention of complex material. Conclusion. The elective course provided in-depth exposure to the mechanisms underlying electrophysiological aberrations resulting in arrhythmias. It gave learners an opportunity to learn the art of ECG interpretation and to apply their knowledge in simulated scenarios. As clinical teams adopt a multidisciplinary team approach to patient care, acquiring these skills enriches learner experiences and allows them to expand their role and professional opportunities as pharmacists.

J	Zhu, XC; Chen, HF; Luan, WL				Zhu, Xuanchen; Chen, Haofeng; Luan, Weiling			On the study of cyclic plasticity behaviour of primary electrode particle for lithium-ion battery	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS			English	Article						Li-ion battery electrode; Diffusion induced stress; Cyclic plasticity behaviour; The linear matching method	TEMPERATURE LIFE INTEGRITY; DIFFUSION-INDUCED STRESS; 2-PHASE LITHIATION; SHAKEDOWN ANALYSIS; DEFORMATION; MODEL; LIMIT; ASSESSMENTS; FRACTURE	The mechanical failure of battery electrode, caused by the cyclic diffusion-induced stress, is generally thought to be a direct reason leading to the loss of capacity and deterioration of performance for Li-ion battery. In the present work, the cyclic plasticity behaviour of primary electrode particle under electrochemical-mechanical condition is evaluated by using the Linear Matching Method (LMM). The coupled diffusion-stress analysis of electrode particle during lithiation-delithiation process is performed with the developed finite element subroutines as the groundwork for the subsequent cyclic plasticity assessment. The shakedown boundaries are established for electrode particle considering the variation of particle diameter by means of the LMM. ABAQUS full cyclic incremental analysis is employed to verify the applicability and accuracy of the obtained boundary. Two types of failure mechanisms known as low-cycle fatigue and ratcheting are investigated for particle subjected to loading history out of shakedown boundary. Steady state cycle analysis is conducted to study the generation of plastic strain range of particle under certain electrochemical-mechanical condition and the corresponding low-cycle fatigue damage is assessed. Different forms of ratcheting boundaries for electrode particle with various dimensions are created and the influences of cyclic current density and mechanical load on cyclic plasticity limits are clarified. The established critical failure diagrams will offer the instructional information regarding the design of electrode material in microscale within designated electrochemical condition.

Despite the fact that Web 2.0 applications are widely used for both educational and professional purposes, a consolidated methodology for their evaluation is still not available. This paper presents and discusses the results of two empirical studies on the case of mind mapping and diagramming Web 2.0 applications. Both studies employed logging actual use method to measure the estimated quality in use, while the retrospective thinking aloud method and an online questionnaire were applied to assess the perceived quality in use. Achieved analytical results showed that the results of the estimated and the perceived quality in use match partially, which indicates that quality in use should be measured with both subjective and objective instruments. The work presented in this paper is the first step towards a comprehensive methodology for evaluating the quality in use of Web 2.0 applications. Consequently, the usage of the proposed quality in use model for other types of Web 2.0 applications as well as contexts of use needs to be investigated in order to draw generalizable conclusions.

This study aims to explore the perceptions of current and prospective survivorship services from both groups in Singapore to propose service design and delivery strategies. Methods: Focus group discussions with 23 AYA cancer survivors between the ages of 16 and 39 years at diagnosis and 18 HCPs were conducted in National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS) and Singapore Cancer Society (SCS). All focus group discussions were transcribed verbatim. Deductive thematic analysis was performed according to the components of a design thinking model: empathizing with AYA survivors, defining care gaps, proposing services, and implementation strategies. Results: AYA survivors preferred age-specific services that are aligned with their personal goals. Current survivorship care failed to address the needs of survivors' dependents (caregivers and children) and to consider the utility of each service temporally. Prospective services should clarify disease disclosure obligation in job search and introduce a care navigator. Key implementation strategies included (1) training HCPs on communication techniques with AYA, (2) selecting engagement platforms that complement survivors' information-seeking behavior, (3) improving outreach to survivors through appropriate branding and publicity, and (4) consolidating services from multiple providers. Conclusions: The design of survivorship care services for AYA survivors should be systematic in its conceptualization process and employ implementation strategies. The coordination of the wide spectrum of services warrants a concerted effort by cancer centers, community partners, and the government.

Insulin decision aids help diabetes patients, most of whom are elderly to make an informed decision to start insulin. However, the lack of usability guidelines applicable for such target group causes developers to struggle to answer the challenging question 'How can such web service be made usable, and, ultimately, acceptable and accessible for elderly patients?'. Hence, the purpose of this study is to identify the common usability requirements that may facilitate good practices to empower elderly diabetes patients in utilizing a web-based insulin decision aid for their benefit. We set out an approach to use prototyping and retrospective think-aloud techniques to explore web usability barriers that elderly patients may encounter when using an insulin decision aid web site and use the feedback for improving the prototype. Usability requirements were captured iteratively through scoping, brainstorming, prototype, testing and evaluating. The study suggests that the insights from experts and users are equally important to assure the validity of the identified usability guidelines; they reflect the accessibility needs of the aging community while complementing the key requirements of an insulin decision aid. The study contributes to recommend web usability guidelines backed by a series of expert and user evaluations which could be a proactive resource to improve usability, acceptability and accessibility of online insulin decision aids for elderly with diabetes.

Rock sponges (lithistid Demospongiae) of the Northeast Atlantic seamounts, with description of ten new species	PEERJ			English	Article						Porifera; Deep-sea; Lithistids; Biodiversity; Tetractinellida; Bubarida; New species; Biogeography	SP-NOV PORIFERA; PETROMICA TOPSENT; DEEP-SEA; FAUNA; GENUS; DIVERSITY; REVISION; TETRACTINELLIDA; HALICHONDRIDA; SYSTEMATICS	Background: Lithistid demosponges, also known as rock sponges, are a polyphyletic group of sponges which are widely distributed. In the Northeast Atlantic (NEA), 17 species are known and the current knowledge on their distribution is mainly restricted to the Macaronesian islands. In the Mediterranean Sea, 14 species are recorded and generally found in marine caves. Methods: Lithistids were sampled in nine NEA seamounts during the scientific expeditions Seamount 1 (1987) and Seamount 2 (1993) organized by the MNHN of Paris. Collected specimens were identified through the analyses of external and internal morphological characters using light and scanning electron microscopy, and compared with material from various museum collections as well as literature records. Results: A total of 68 specimens were analysed and attributed to 17 species across two orders, seven families, and seven genera, representing new records of distribution. Ten of these species are new to science, viz. Neoschrammeniella inaequalis sp. nov., N. piserai sp. nov., N. pomponiae sp. nov., Discodermia arbor sp. nov., D. kellyae sp. nov., Macandrewia schusterae sp. nov., M. minima sp. nov., Exsuperantia levii sp. nov., Leiodermatium tuba sp. nov. and Siphonidium elongatus sp. nov., and are here described and illustrated. New bathymetric records were also found for D. ramifera, D. verrucosa and M. robusta. The Meteor seamount group has a higher species richness (15 species) compared to the Lusitanian seamount group (six species). The majority of the species had their distribution restricted to one seamount, and ten are only known from a single locality, but this can be a result of sample bias. Discussion: The number of species shared between the seamounts and the Macaronesian islands is very reduced. The same pattern repeats between the NEA and Mediterranean Sea. This study demonstrates that NEA seamounts are ecosystems with a higher diversity of lithistids than previously thought, increasing the number of lithistids known to occur in the NEA and Mediterranean Sea from 26 to 36 species.

J	Upadhyaya, A; Nath, S; Kumar, S				Upadhyaya, Anurag; Nath, Shesh; Kumar, Sanjay			Force-induced rupture of double-stranded DNA in the absence and presence of covalently bonded anti-tumor drugs: Insights from molecular dynamics simulations	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							PARTICLE MESH EWALD; COMPLEMENTARY STRANDS; MITOMYCIN-C; MECHANISM; BINDING; MODE	DNA intra-strand cross-link (ICL) agents are widely used in the treatment of cancer. ICLs are thought to form a link between the same strand (intra-strand) or complimentary strand (inter-strand) and thereby increase the stability of DNA, which forbids the processes like replication and transcription. As a result, cell death occurs. In this work, we have studied the enhanced stability of a double stranded DNA in the presence of ICLs and compared our findings with the results obtained in the absence of these links. Using atomistic simulations with explicit solvent, a force is applied along and perpendicular to the direction of the helix and we measured the rupture force and the unzipping force of DNA-ICL complexes. Our results show that the rupture and the unzipping forces increase significantly in the presence of these links. The ICLs bind to the minor groove of DNA, which enhance the DNA stabilisation. Such information may be used to design alternative drugs that can stall replication and transcription that are critical to a growing number of anticancer drug discovery efforts.

J	Ramos, AL; Ferreira, JV; Barceló, J				Ramos, Ana Luisa; Ferreira, Jose Vasconcelos; Barcelo, Jaume			REVISITING THE SIMILAR PROCESS TO ENGINEER THE CONTEMPORARY SYSTEMS	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						SIMILAR process; systems engineering; standards; MBSE	ARCHITECTURE; CHALLENGES; PRINCIPLES; FRAMEWORK; THINKING; SCIENCE; DESIGN	This paper addresses the present-day context of Systems Engineering, revisiting and setting up an updated framework for the SIMILAR process in order to use it to engineer the contemporary systems. The contemporary world is crowded of large interdisciplinary complex systems made of other systems, personnel, hardware, software, information, processes, and facilities. An integrated holistic approach is crucial to develop these systems and take proper account of their multifaceted nature and numerous interrelationships. As the system's complexity and extent grow, the number of parties involved (stakeholders and shareholders) usually also raises, bringing to the interaction a considerable amount of points of view, skills, responsibilities, and interests. The Systems Engineering approach aims to tackle the complex and interdisciplinary whole of those socio-technical systems, providing the means to enable their successful realization. Its exploitation in our modern world is assuming an increasing relevance noticeable by emergent standards, academic papers, international conferences, and post-graduate programmes in the field. This work aims to provide "the picture" of modern Systems Engineering, and to update the context of the SIMILAR process model in order to use this renewed framework to engineer the challenging contemporary systems. The emerging trends in the field are also pointed-out with particular reference to the Model-Based Systems Engineering approach.

Influence of Abrams M1A1 Main Battle Tank Disturbance on Tallgrass Prairie Plant Community Structure	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Animal-Science	JUL 07-12, 2007	San Antonio, TX	Amer Soc Anim Sci		military impacts; net primary production; resilience; species composition	TRACKED VEHICLE IMPACTS; VEGETATION; COVER; GRASSLANDS; KANSAS	The Department of Defense's Range and Training Land Assessment program provides information and recommendations to range managers regarding the condition of training lands. This information is used to assist in scheduling training areas and in monitoring the effectiveness of rehabilitation projects. Fort Riley Military Installation is a major training reservation located in the Flint Hills of northeastern Kansas, within the tallgrass prairie ecosystem. A randomized complete block design composed of three treatments (M1A1 Abrams tank traffic during wet and dry soil conditions, and a nontrafficked control) with three replications was established in each of two soil types, a silty clay loam and a silt loam soil, on Fort Riley in 2003. Disturbance was created by driving the tank for five circuits in a figure-eight pattern during either during wet or dry soil conditions. Two additional experimental treatments were added during the study: five additional tank passes on one-half of each figure eight in 2004 and burning in 2006. Two areas, a curve and straightaway, within each traffic intensity (and later, burn treatment) subplot were designated for sampling. Aboveground biomass, species composition, and ground cover were measured during each growing season. Recovery of grass and total aboveground biomass in silty clay loam soil was delayed for curve areas and following disturbance in wet soil conditions, respectively. Species composition and ground cover continued to exhibit significant disturbance effects in 2007, with greatest damage observed for repeated traffic under wet soil conditions. Fire effects on vegetation were variable and generally greater for undisturbed control plots than for disturbed areas. The tallgrass prairie typically is considered to be among the most resilient of military training lands, but our research suggests that resiliency is dependent upon soil type and training conditions, and may require longer periods of recovery than previously thought.

Subjects and methods: The study has a quantitative design. Ethical permissions were obtained, data were collected digitally, and power analysis was performed for sample size. The sample size was calculated as 656 pregnant women. In the collection of the data, the Personal Information Form, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used. Results: In our study, the majority of pregnant women (86.3%) were concerned about the pandemic process, with more than half thinking that their pregnancy (62.9%) and delivery processes would be affected (66.2%). In the meantime, 60.2% of the pregnant women postponed their health checks and they indicated being most concerned about their babies (57.1%). In 51.2% of the pregnant women, the state anxiety levels were low, and 89.8% of the trait anxiety levels were moderate. Conclusions: In crisis periods like the pandemic, pregnant women are among the priority groups. Screening, prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of affective disorders in the prenatal period are important for maternal and fetal health.

Design: Structured telephone interviews. Participants: 104 PRHOs. Main outcome measures: Information about frequency and quality of involvement of PRHOs in discussions on bad news with patients and relatives, perceived competency and difficulties related to this task as well as ethical views concerning the disclosure of bad news. Results: 82 PRHOs (78.9%) had initiated the breaking of bad news to a patient at least once, whilst patients themselves had initiated discussions of bad news by asking the doctors questions (92.3%). Almost all (96.2%), indicated that they had broken bad news to relatives of a patient. The majority of the junior doctors participating in our study felt fairly or very confident (90.4%) to break bad news. 'Often' quoted difficulties for over a fifth of the sample included 'Thinking I was not the appropriate person to discuss the bad news', 'Having all the relevant information available', 'Dealing with emotions of patient/relative', 'Lack of privacy' and 'Patients/relatives do not speak English'. Although 99 PRHOs (95.2%) believed that patients should be informed about a serious life threatening illness, 30.8% of the participants stated that doctors need to judge whether or not to tell a patient bad news. Factors most frequently selected by the PRHOs from a given list of possible factors contributing to a gap between theory and practice included problems with the organization of clinics (73.1%), insufficient postgraduate training (63.5%) and lack of staff (54.8%). Conclusions: The results indicate that PRHOs are frequently involved in the breaking of bad news. Whilst no claims can be made for their actual performance in practice, their perceptions of competency would indicate that the extensive and compulsory undergraduate teaching they had received on this subject has served to prepare them for this difficult task. Organizational and structural aspects need to be taken into account as factors assisting or undermining doctors in their efforts to put into practice ethically sound and skilled communication when disclosing bad news.

Compared with birds and mammals, few studies have investigated the Ig light chain of crocodilians. Here, employing an Alligator sinensis genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library and available genome data, we characterized the genomic organization of the Alligator sinensis IgL gene loci. The Alligator sinensis has two IgL isotypes, lambda and kappa, the same as Anolis carolinensis. The Ig(lambda) locus contains 6 C-lambda genes, each preceded by a J(lambda) gene, and 86 potentially functional V-lambda genes upstream of (J(lambda)-C-lambda)(n). The Ig kappa locus contains a single C-kappa gene, 6 J(kappa)s and 62 functional V(kappa)s. All V-L genes are classified into a total of 31 families: 19 V-lambda families and 12 V-kappa families. Based on an analysis of the chromosomal location of the light chain genes among mammals, birds, lizards and frogs, the data further confirm that there are two IgL isotypes in the Alligator sinensis: Ig lambda and Ig kappa. By analyzing the cloned Ig lambda/kappa cDNA, we identified a biased usage pattern of V families in the expressed V-lambda and V-kappa. An analysis of the junctions of the recombined VJ revealed the presence of N and P nucleotides in both expressed. and. sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the V genes revealed V families shared by mammals, birds, reptiles and Xenopus, suggesting that these conserved V families are orthologous and have been retained during the evolution of IgL. Our data suggest that the Alligator sinensis IgL gene repertoire is highly diverse and complex and provide insight into immunoglobulin gene evolution in vertebrates.

J	Pinnegar, CR				Pinnegar, CR			Polarization analysis and polarization filtering of three-component signals with the time-frequency <i>S</i> transform	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						particle motion; polarization analysis; polarization filtering; spectral analysis; time-frequency analysis; wavelets		From basic Fourier theory, a one-component signal can be expressed as a superposition of sinusoidal oscillations in time, with the Fourier amplitude and phase spectra describing the contribution of each sinusoid to the total signal. By extension, three-component signals can be thought of as superpositions of sinusoids oscillating in the x-, y-, and z-directions, which, when considered one frequency at a time, trace out elliptical motion in three-space. Thus the total three-component signal can be thought of as a superposition of ellipses. The information contained in the Fourier spectra of the x-, y-, and z-components of the signal can then be re-expressed as Fourier spectra of the elements of these ellipses, namely: the lengths of their semi-major and semi-minor axes, the strike and dip of each ellipse plane, the pitch of the major axis, and the phase of the particle motion at each frequency. The same type of reasoning can be used with windowed Fourier transforms (such as the S transform), to give time-varying spectra of the elliptical elements. These can be used to design signal-adaptive polarization filters that reject signal components with specific polarization properties. Filters of this type are not restricted to reducing the whole amplitude of any particular ellipse; for example, the 'linear' part of the ellipse can be retained while the 'circular' part is rejected. This paper describes the mathematics behind this technique, and presents three examples: an earthquake seismogram that is first separated into linear and circular parts, and is later filtered specifically to remove the Rayleigh wave; and two shot gathers, to which similar Rayleigh-wave filters have been applied on a trace-by-trace basis.

Cervico-ocular Reflex Is Increased in People With Nonspecific Neck Pain	PHYSICAL THERAPY			English	Article							MUSCLE SPINDLE SYSTEM; EYE-MOVEMENTS; WHIPLASH INJURY; SENSORIMOTOR DISTURBANCES; VISUAL DISTURBANCES; DISABILITY INDEX; CERVICAL RANGE; DUTCH VERSION; DIZZINESS; POSITION	Background. Neck pain is a widespread complaint. People experiencing neck pain often present an altered timing in contraction of cervical muscles. This altered afferent information elicits the cervico-ocular reflex (COR), which stabilizes the eye in response to trunk-to-head movements. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) elicited by the vestibulum is thought to be unaffected by afferent information from the cervical spine. Objective. The aim of the study was to measure the COR and VOR in people with nonspecific neck pain. Design. This study utilized a cross-sectional design in accordance with the STROBE statement. Methods. An infrared eye-tracking device was used to record the COR and the VOR while the participant was sitting on a rotating chair in darkness. Eye velocity was calculated by taking the derivative of the horizontal eye position. Parametric statistics were performed. Results. The mean COR gain in the control group (n = 30) was 0.26 (SD = 0.15) compared with 0.38 (SD = 0.16) in the nonspecific neck pain group (n = 37). Analyses of covariance were performed to analyze differences in COR and VOR gains, with age and sex as covariates. Analyses of covariance showed a significantly increased COR in participants with neck pain. The VOR between the control group, with a mean VOR of 0.67 (SD = 0.17), and the nonspecific neck pain group, with a mean VOR of 0.66 (SD = 0.22), was not significantly different. Limitations. Measuring eye movements while the participant is sitting on a rotating chair in complete darkness is technically complicated. Conclusions. This study suggests that people with nonspecific neck pain have an increased COR. The COR is an objective, nonvoluntary eye reflex and an unaltered VOR. This study shows that an increased COR is not restricted to patients with traumatic neck pain.

As older people seek to live out their years at home, family members, friends and neighbours (informal caregivers) are increasingly relied upon for support. Moreover, pressured health systems and shorter hospital length of stay mean that informal caregivers can find themselves supporting the older person who is still unwell after discharge. The Further Enabling Care at Home (FECH) program was developed as a nursing outreach intervention designed to systematically address support needs of family caregivers of older people after hospital discharge to sustain their home-based caregiving. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences of informal caregivers who participated in the FECH program after an older family member's discharge from hospital. Methods: The study employed a qualitative descriptive design. Caregivers of older people discharged home from a Medical Assessment Unit in an Australian hospital who were included in the program were interviewed to explore their experiences and perceptions of the FECH program. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results: Twenty-one family caregivers (81% female, aged 25-89years) participated in the interviews. Themes emerging were The experience of caregiving'; 'The experience of receiving FECH program support'; and 'Caregivers' suggestions for improvement'. Caregivers indicated that reflective discussions with the FECH nurse enabled them to recognise the complexity of the caregiving role and determine aspects where they needed support. Caregivers valued guidance from the FECH nurse in accessing information and resources, which helped them to feel more connected to support, more prepared to care for the older person and themselves, and more secure in the caregiving role. Conclusions: Caregivers' experiences indicated that the structured reflective FECH discussions prompted thought and provided guidance in navigating health and care systems. The FECH program appears to offer a means to address the practical, physical and psychosocial needs of informal caregivers as partners in person-centred health and social care.

Population graphs are thought of as non-linear structures that capture the relationships between individual subjects represented as nodes, which allows for the simultaneous integration of imaging and non-imaging information as well as individual subjects' features. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) generalize convolution operations to accommodate non-Euclidean data and aid in the mining of topological information from the population graph for a disease classification task. However, few studies have examined how GCNs' input properties affect AD-staging performance. Therefore, we conducted three experiments in this work. Experiment 1 examined how the inclusion of demographic information in the edge-assigning function affects the classification of AD versus cognitive normal (CN). Experiment 2 was designed to examine the effects of adding various neuropsychological tests to the edge-assigning function on the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) classification. Experiment 3 studied the impact of the edge assignment function. The best result was obtained in Experiment 2 on multi-class classification (AD, MCI, and CN). We applied a novel framework for the diagnosis of AD that integrated CNNs and GCNs into a unified network, taking advantage of the excellent feature extraction capabilities of CNNs and population-graph processing capabilities of GCNs. To learn high-level anatomical features, DenseNet was used; a set of population graphs was represented with nodes defined by imaging features and edge weights determined by different combinations of imaging or/and non-imaging information, and the generated graphs were then fed to the GCNs for classification. Both binary classification and multi-class classification showed improved performance, with an accuracy of 91.6% for AD versus CN, 91.2% for AD versus MCI, 96.8% for MCI versus CN, and 89.4% for multi-class classification. The population graph's imaging features and edge-assigning functions can both significantly affect classification accuracy.

Nudging people towards more sustainable residential choice decisions: an intervention based on focalism and visualization	TRANSPORTATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference of the International-Association-of-Travel-Behavior-Research (IATBR) on Travel Behaviour Research	JUL, 2015	Windsor, ENGLAND	Int Assoc Travel Behav Res		Travel behavior; Choice modeling; Urban; Intervention	TRAVEL BEHAVIOR; BUILT ENVIRONMENT	There have been numerous behavior change studies focused on sustainable travel mode choices. In this study we focused on the residential choices that in turn influence travel habits. We designed and implemented two interventions, which we term the focalism and visualization interventions, based on literature in psychological economics. The focalism intervention was motivated by literature that suggests people make suboptimal choices when looking for a new home. While focus is given to immediately tangible features like the quality of the house, important but less tangible factors like access to transportation are relatively overlooked. The visualization intervention was based on literature showing that providing information at decision points when long-ingrained habits are vulnerable to change, such as at the time of a residential move, can be influential on choices. We designed both interventions to be interactive so that the intervention was discovered by respondents rather than presented directly as information. With the focalism intervention, we pointed out differences in how respondents ranked their search priorities for new housing and neighborhoods, versus how they ranked what they reported makes them happy. With the visualization intervention, we explained to respondents that moving is an opportunity to make changes in one's life, and we prompted them to think through what they desired to change. We evaluated the influence of these interventions on residential housing decisions by surveying respondents about their priorities in residential search before and after the interventions, and by collecting information about their housing, neighborhoods, travel patterns, and reported well-being. The surveys were web-based, with one survey conducted before respondents moved and a second survey conducted afterward. Participants were randomly assigned to a focalism treatment group, a visualization treatment group, or a control group. 380 respondents answered the pre-move survey, and 184 of these answered the post-move survey. In the pre-move survey, we found that both the focalism and visualization interventions resulted in a significant increase in the fraction of people who planned to travel more sustainably relative to the control group. More importantly, we found that after the post-move survey, respondents in the focalism group, but not the visualization group, significantly reduced their travel time to work and increased their cycling, walking, carpooling, carsharing and transit use in comparison to the control group. Meanwhile, those in the visualization treatment group had significantly higher reported well-being after the move; those in the focalism treatment group also improved their stated well-being, though less significantly; and there was no change in the control group. These results suggest that it might be relatively easy to nudge residential choices towards both more sustainable travel and greater well-being.

They should not only enhance their preventive awareness of disasters but also enhance their response capability. When miners are in danger with invalid escape lighting, it is difficult for them to overcome panic. Therefore, the automatic assisted escape system has a particular engineering significance in underground space. This study attempts to develop a reference technical framework for emergency evacuation of underground space workers. A human-environment-computer interaction system is developed, which combines the A*-3D Time algorithm with mixed reality (MR) technology. It is constrained by the spatial geometric information of the mine and the escape time. Firstly, the target mine's geographic information and spatial structure are surveyed on the field, and a 3D digital model is built by the 3DMine; the BIM is used to integrate 3DMine information (data and material) and design the spatial structure. Secondly, based on the A* algorithm in 3D space, the escape time is introduced to evaluate the escape capability and construct the A*-3D Time model. Thirdly, the timeliness of mine water-inrush scenario is simulated by the Comsol; the interaction method and navigation map are developed by the OpenXR and MR Toolkit (MRTK) in Game Engine; the A*-3D Time model is introduced into the C# script and assigned to the digital objects (Mine and Miners). Finally, the performance of this system is analyzed based on the underground metal mine. Based on game thinking to solve safety problems can be used as a reference for underground space engineering.

William			Developing Conversational Agents for Use in Criminal Investigations	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERACTIVE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Explainability; criminal intelligence analysis; conversational agents; transparency	MODEL; TRUST	The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in environments that involve high risk and high consequence decision-making is severely hampered by critical design issues. These issues include system transparency and brittleness, where transparency relates to (i) the explainability of results and (ii) the ability of a user to inspect and verify system goals and constraints; and brittleness, (iii) the ability of a system to adapt to new user demands. Transparency is a particular concern for criminal intelligence analysis, where there are significant ethical and trust issues that arise when algorithmic and system processes are not adequately understood by a user. This prevents adoption of potentially useful technologies in policing environments. In this article, we present a novel approach to designing a conversational agent (CA) AI system for intelligence analysis that tackles these issues. We discuss the results and implications of three different studies; a Cognitive Task Analysis to understand analyst thinking when retrieving information in an investigation, Emergent Themes Analysis to understand the explanation needs of different system components, and an interactive experiment with a prototype conversational agent. Our prototype conversational agent, named Pan, demonstrates transparency provision and mitigates brittleness by evolving new CA intentions. We encode interactions with the CA with human factors principles for situation recognition and use interactive visual analytics to support analyst reasoning. Our approach enables complex AI systems, such as Pan, to be used in sensitive environments, and our research has broader application than the use case discussed.

The objective is to devise methods capable of converting.,, geometrical luminous and, data into reliable information oil the state of practical combustion systems. suitable processing methods are needed to extract representative information from flame images. as they contain large amounts of data whose physical interpretation is not. in general, straight forward. A thorough experimental programme has been conducted in a model industrial burner. in order to create a database of flame images, for Subsequent analysis. One of the options is the extraction and analysis of representative images C features: even though the parametric studies revealed good sensitivity to changes in combustion regimes, this approach may entail some information loss and requires adaptation to the specific system. The other two methods explored are designed as flame identification techniques based oil the whole image. One of them use self-organising feature Maps and yields as Output the most probable combustion regime. among those previously characterised. The other one is an adaptation of a speech recognition method and informs about the probability of an unknown State to correspond with the different combustion regimes. Their performance was tested in terms of their success rate for identification as well as oil their capabilities to estimate NOx emission, its a representative outcome of the combustion process. Results ill other combustion situations (oil burner and premixed combustor) are also reported. The good results obtained in all cases are thought to Support the potential of the methods described for flame monitoring. (C) 2008 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

To date, studies of clinicians' perceptions of AI have found only moderate acceptability, suggesting the need for further research regarding how to integrate it into clinical practice. Objective: The aim of the study was to determine contextual factors that may support or constrain the uptake of AI in pathology. Methods: To go beyond a simple listing of barriers and facilitators, we drew on the approach of realist evaluation and undertook a review of the literature to elicit stakeholders' theories of how, for whom, and in what circumstances AI can provide benefit in pathology. Searches were designed by an information specialist and peer-reviewed by a second information specialist. Searches were run on the arXiv.org repository, MEDLINE, and the Health Management Information Consortium, with additional searches undertaken on a range of websites to identify gray literature. In line with a realist approach, we also made use of relevant theory. Included documents were indexed in NVivo 12, using codes to capture different contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes that could affect the introduction of AI in pathology. Coded data were used to produce narrative summaries of each of the identified contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes, which were then translated into theories in the form of context-mechanism-outcome configurations. Results: A total of 101 relevant documents were identified. Our analysis indicates that the benefits that can be achieved will vary according to the size and nature of the pathology department's workload and the extent to which pathologists work collaboratively; the major perceived benefit for specialist centers is in reducing workload. For uptake of AI, pathologists' trust is essential. Existing theories suggest that if pathologists are able to "make sense" of AI, engage in the adoption process, receive support in adapting their work processes, and can identify potential benefits to its introduction, it is more likely to be accepted. Conclusions: For uptake of AI in pathology, for all but the most simple quantitative tasks, measures will be required that either increase confidence in the system or provide users with an understanding of the performance of the system. For specialist centers, efforts should focus on reducing workload rather than increasing accuracy. Designers also need to give careful thought to usability and how AI is integrated into pathologists' workflow.

Approved Clinical Instructors' Perspectives on Implementation Strategies in Evidence-Based Practice for Athletic Training Students	JOURNAL OF ATHLETIC TRAINING			English	Article						clinical education; role modeling; qualitative research	EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE; TEACHING EBP; EDUCATION	Context: Understanding implementation strategies of Approved Clinibal Instructors (ACIs) who use evidence-based practice (EBP) in clinical instruction will help promote the use of EBP in clinical practice. Objective: To examine the perspectives and experiences of ACIs using EBP concepts in undergraduate athletic training education programs to determine the importance of using these concepts in clinical practice, clinical EBP implementation strategies for students, and challenges of implementing EBP into clinical practice while mentoring and teaching their students. Design: Qualitative study. Setting: Telephone interviews. Patients or Other Participants: Sixteen ACIs (11 men, 5 women; experience as a certified athletic trainer = 10 +/- 4.7 years, experience as an ACI = 6.8 +/- 3.9 years) were interviewed. Data Collection and Analysis: We interviewed each participant by telephone. Interview transcripts were analyzed and coded for common themes and subthemes regarding implementation strategies. Established themes were triangulated through peer review and member checking to verify the data. Results: The ACIs identified EBP implementation as important for validation of the profession, changing paradigm shift, improving patient care, and improving student educational experiences. They promoted 3 methods of implementing EBP concepts with their students: self-discovery, promoting critical thinking, and sharing information. They assisted students with the steps of EBP and often faced challenges in implementation of the first 3 steps of EBP: defining a clinical question, literature searching, and literature appraisal. Finally, ACIs indicated that modeling the behavior of making clinical decisions based on evidence was the best way to encourage students to continue using EBP. Conclusions: Athletic training education program directors should encourage and recommend specific techniques for EBP implementation in the clinical setting. The ACIs believed that role modeling is a strategy that can be used to promote the use of EBP with students. Training of ACIs should include methods by which to address the steps of the EBP process while still promoting critical thinking.

The novelty of this paper lies in the consideration of a new integral inequality proved to be less conservative than the celebrated Jensen's inequality and takes fully the relationship between the terms in the Leibniz-Newton formula within the framework of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) into account. Based on this new integral inequality approach (IIA), an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed and showed to have a great potential efficience in practice. Besides, by employing a delay decomposition approach which gives enough thought to information of the delayed plant states, improved delay-dependent stability criteria in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are derived. Four numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and the advantage of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Generic Multimodal Ontologies for Human-Agent Interaction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						multimodal ontology; ontology matching; interface agents; Semantic Web; human-agent interaction	SYSTEMS	Watching the evolution of the Semantic Web (SW) from its inception to these days we can easily observe that the main task the developers face while building it is to encode the human knowledge into ontologies and the human reasoning into dedicated reasoning engines. Now, the SW needs to have efficient mechanisms to access information by both humans and artificial agents. The most important tools in this context are ontologies. The last years have been dedicated to solving the infrastructure problems related to ontologies: ontology management, ontology matching, ontology adoption, but as time goes by and these problems are better understood the research interests in this area will surely shift towards the way in which agents will use them to communicate between them and with humans. Despite the fact that interface agents could be bilingual, it would be more efficient, safe and swift that they should use the same language to communicate with humans and with their peers. Since anthropocentric systems entail nowadays multimodal interfaces, it seems suitable to build multimodal ontologies. Generic ontologies are needed when dealing with uncertainty. Multimodal ontologies should be designed taking into account our way of thinking (mind maps, visual thinking, feedback, logic, emotions, etc.) and also the processes in which they would be involved (multimodal fusion and integration, error reduction, natural language processing, multimodal fission, etc.). By doing this it would be easier for us (and also fun) to use ontologies, but in the same time the communication with agents (and also agent to agent talk) would be enhanced. This is just one of our conclusions related to why building generic multimodal ontologies is very important for future semantic web applications.

It is commonly assumed that cerebellum-based motor learning is guided by the difference between the desired and the actual behavior, i.e., by error information. Not only immediate but also future behavior will benefit from an error because it induces lasting changes of parallel fiber synapses on Purkinje cells (PCs), whose output mediates the behavioral adjustments. Olivary climbing fibers, likewise connecting with PCs, are thought to transport information on instant errors needed for the synaptic modification yet not to contribute to error memory. Here, we report work on monkeys tested in a saccadic learning paradigm that challenges this concept. We demonstrate not only a clear complex spikes (CS) signature of the error at the time of its occurrence but also a reverberation of this signature much later, before a new manifestation of the behavior, suitable to improve it.

This finding updated the above preconception. Nevertheless, it should also be noted that PTUEG(3), under high humidity, absorbs water and is plasticized to lose its mechanical strength. Humidity-induced plasticization is a general problem for polymers with polar groups. Herein, we report that PTUEG(3), if designed by copolymerization to contain only 10 mol % of a dicyclohexylmethane (Cy2M) thiourea unit (TUCy2M), serves as a humidity-tolerant, mechanically robust polymer material that can self-heal at ambient temperatures. This copolymer contained, in its ether thiourea (TUEG(3))-rich domain, a humidity-tolerant, noncovalently cross-linked 3D network with mechanical robustness formed by stacking of the Cy2M group. The present work provides a promising design strategy for mechanically robust, self-healable polymers usable under high humidity.

Nevertheless, besides the complexity of designing, contracting and building these structures, a barrier to their market growth is the complexity of their supply chain relationships encompassing architects, engineers, builders and suppliers. The objective of this study is therefore to identify and characterize the supply chain relationships shared by these stakeholders within a massive timber construction project. Twenty-seven semi-structured interviews with architects, structural engineers, builders and timber element suppliers from nine countries, participant observations and secondary data were used to study the various relationship levels involved in timber construction projects. Triangulation and qualitative data analysis were also conducted. Three levels of relationships were then identified: "Contractual," "Massive timber construction project" and "Massive timber construction industry development." Results showed that timber structures involve value-added stakeholder relationships rather than linear relationships.

Furthermore, prefabricated systems allow for smoother relationships by limiting the number of stakeholders while promoting innovative thinking.

This study was planned as descriptive research in Isparta. A random sample of n=256 individuals of both genders was recruited at the largest shopping center. As a means of collection tool, a survey consisted of two forms, the first designed for sociodemographic information and the second covering 29 questions suitable for the content of Health Belief Model. Of the participants, 66.8% were female and 33.2% were male, and the average age was 33.3 +/- 11.0 years. Some 46.1% partly thought that they may develop cancer, and 49.6% were afraid of this possibility. As many as 50% indicated that cancer is an issue that comes from Allah. A significant difference was found between not going for control unless feeling bad, and blood analysis for cancer screening (chi(2)=3.780 p=0.03). It was seen that in an area with a high rate of cancer, people's awareness of cancer prevention and early diagnosis and attitudes towards these are insufficient.

Design and methods: The sample, which was carried out using the visual phenomenology method, consisted of 60 immigrant children between the ages of 4-14. The data were collected by face-to-face interviews with the chil-dren and family, using the Family Information Form and the Family Drawing Test. The data obtained from the drawings were analyzed with the MAXQDA 2022 program. Results: The pictures drawn by the children were examined and 3 themes (Chaos, Necessity, Development) and 9 sub-themes (Interpersonal Relations, Thoughts about Future, Violence, Authority, Emotional State, Communica-tion, Needs and Desires, Role Modeling, Personality) were formed. Conclusions: It was determined that the family relations of immigrant children were adversely affected, children had conflicts with family members, were exposed to violence, felt many emotions, such as fear, anxiety, loneli-ness, anger, longing, exclusion, and needed communication, attention, and support. Implication to practice: It is thought that nurses could use the picture analysis method to understand the feelings and thoughts of children.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Well conceived, designed and implemented monitoring of biodiversity should: (i) deliver information on trends in key aspects of biodiversity (e.g. population changes); (ii) provide early warning of problems that might otherwise be difficult or expensive to reverse; (iii) generate quantifiable evidence of conservation successes (e.g. species recovery following management) and conservation failures; (iv) highlight ways to make management more effective; and (v) provide information on return on conservation investment. The importance of effective biodiversity monitoring is widely recognized (e.g. Australian Biodiversity Strategy). Yet, while everyone thinks biodiversity monitoring is a good idea, this has not translated into a culture of sound biodiversity monitoring, or widespread use of monitoring data. We identify four barriers to more effective biodiversity monitoring in Australia. These are: (i) many conservation programmes have poorly articulated or vague objectives against which it is difficult to measure progress contributing to design and implementation problems; (ii) the case for long-term and sustained biodiversity monitoring is often poorly developed and/or articulated; (iii) there is often a lack of appropriate institutional support, co-ordination, and targeted funding for biodiversity monitoring; and (iv) there is often a lack of appropriate standards to guide monitoring activities and make data available from these programmes. To deal with these issues, we suggest that policy makers, resource managers and scientists better and more explicitly articulate the objectives of biodiversity monitoring and better demonstrate the case for greater investments in biodiversitymonitoring. There is an urgent need for improved institutional support for biodiversity monitoring in Australia, for improved monitoring standards, and for improved archiving of, and access to, monitoring data. We suggest that more strategic financial, institutional and intellectual investments in monitoring will lead to more efficient use of the resources available for biodiversity conservation and ultimately better conservation outcomes.

Updating the USGS seismic hazard maps for Alaska	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Alaska; Seismic hazard; Paleoseismology	UPPER COOK INLET; GREAT EARTHQUAKES; TRANSITION FAULT; SUBDUCTION; ISLANDS; MOTION; RATES; ZONE; SLIP	The U.S. Geological Survey makes probabilistic seismic hazard maps and engineering design maps for building codes, emergency planning, risk management, and many other applications. The methodology considers all known earthquake sources with their associated magnitude and rate distributions. Specific faults can be modeled if slip-rate or recurrence information is available. Otherwise, areal sources are developed from earthquake catalogs or GPS data. Sources are combined with ground-motion estimates to compute the hazard. The current maps for Alaska were developed in 2007, and included modeled sources for the Alaska-Aleutian megathrust, a few crustal faults, and areal seismicity sources. The megathrust was modeled as a segmented dipping plane with segmentation largely derived from the slip patches of past earthquakes. Some megathrust deformation is aseismic, so recurrence was estimated from seismic history rather than plate rates. Crustal faults included the Fairweather-Queen Charlotte system, the Denali-Totschunda system, the Castle Mountain fault, two faults on Kodiak Island, and the Transition fault, with recurrence estimated from geologic data. Areal seismicity sources were developed for Benioff-zone earthquakes and for crustal earthquakes not associated with modeled faults. We review the current state of knowledge in Alaska from a seismic-hazard perspective, in anticipation of future updates of the maps. Updated source models will consider revised seismicity catalogs, new information on crustal faults, new GPS data, and new thinking on megathrust recurrence, segmentation, and geometry. Revised ground-motion models will provide up-to-date shaking estimates for crustal earthquakes and subduction earthquakes in Alaska. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Gil, P				Gil, Pablo			Short Project-Based Learning with MATLAB Applications to Support the Learning of Video-Image Processing	JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Engineering education; Project-based learning; Educational technology system; Video and image processing		University courses concerning Computer Vision and Image Processing are generally taught using a traditional methodology that is focused on the teacher rather than on the students. This approach is consequently not effective when teachers seek to attain cognitive objectives involving their students' critical thinking. This manuscript covers the development, implementation and assessment of a short project-based engineering course with MATLAB applications Multimedia Engineering being taken by Bachelor's degree students. The principal goal of all course lectures and hands-on laboratory activities was for the students to not only acquire image-specific technical skills but also a general knowledge of data analysis so as to locate phenomena in pixel regions of images and video frames. This would hopefully enable the students to develop skills regarding the implementation of the filters, operators, methods and techniques used for image processing and computer vision software libraries. Our teaching-learning process thus permits the accomplishment of knowledge assimilation, student motivation and skill development through the use of a continuous evaluation strategy to solve practical and real problems by means of short projects designed using MATLAB applications. Project-based learning is not new. This approach has been used in STEM learning in recent decades. But there are many types of projects. The aim of the current study is to analyse the efficacy of short projects as a learning tool when compared to long projects during which the students work with more independence. This work additionally presents the impact of different types of activities, and not only short projects, on students' overall results in this subject. Moreover, a statistical study has allowed the author to suggest a link between the students' success ratio and the type of content covered and activities completed on the course. The results described in this paper show that those students who took part in short projects made a significant improvement when compared to those who participated in long projects.

With a lack of visual feedback, visually impaired people must identify information from the external environment through other sense organs. This study employed an observational survey to assess voice navigation version A, created by visually impaired people, and voice navigation version B, created by non-visually impaired people. Thirty-two simulated visually impaired people were assigned to conduct task assessments of voice navigation version A and version B. For mission 1, the mean completion rate is 0.988 +/- 0.049 (version A); the mean error rate is 0.125 +/- 0.182 (version A). For mission 2, the mean completion rate is 0.953 +/- 0.148 (version A); the mean error rate is 0.094 +/- 0.198 (version A). The assessment results concluded that version A has a higher completion rate (p = 0.001) and a lower error rate (p = 0.001). In the assessment of subjective satisfaction, all the indicators regarding the impression of navigation directives in version A were significantly superior to those indicators in version B. It appears that version A has a different logic of framing than version B. In future applications, a voice navigation version shall be built, according to the way visually impaired people think, because it will facilitate the direction guide when there is a lack of visual feedback.

Applying Learning Principles Within Parent Education: Exploring Nurses' Practice and Parents' Experiences	PATIENT PREFERENCE AND ADHERENCE			English	Article						cognition; metacognition; parent-education; nurses; knowledge; health literacy	PATIENT EDUCATION; HEALTH-CARE; TACIT KNOWLEDGE; PROFESSIONALS; CHILDREN; NEEDS; INTERVENTIONS; PERCEPTIONS; PREFERENCES; MANAGEMENT	Purpose:In parent-education practice nurses use Learning Principles (LPs) when helping parents to develop the knowledge and skills required to care for their children. LPs are basic precepts of learning, comprising people's beliefs, behaviors and reasoning processes. LPs underpin parents' active engagement, confidence building and decision-making, as information provided becomes usable knowl-edge. However, the ways nurses apply LPs in parent-education practice are poorly explained in healthcare. Likewise, descriptions of parents' learning experiences, associated with the use of LPs in nurse/parent-education interactions, are lacking. This study aimed to explore and describe nurses' perceptions and use of LPs, and parents' learning experiences in one healthcare organization.Participants and Methods: Using an action research design, 25 nurses and 18 parent participants were purposively recruited across metropolitan Adelaide, Australia. Data were collected through observations and semi-structured interviews and thematically analyzed simultaneously June-December 2017.Results: The LPs nurses used, and those important to parents' learning experiences created three overarching themes: 1) collaborative relationships, 2) deepening learning insights, 3) the learning environment. Despite their apparent use, nurses struggled to explicitly describe how they perceived LPs, believing their knowledge and use was sub-conscious - tacit. However, tacit knowledge hinders communication and explanation of LPs used within parent-education to other nurses. The member-checking of interview data helped to stimulate the nurses' metacognition (thinking about their thinking), unlocking their LPs awareness. Conclusion: Nurses used LPs in practice but their knowledge was tacit. Through metacognition, nurses started to recognize the ways LPs influenced their practice and parents' learning capabilities. Increasing healthcare constraints, including time allowed for parent -education, require nurses to optimize their use of LPs. Future research should identify ways nurses can communicate their use of LPs, potentially enhancing parents' active learning experiences and concordance with health recommendations.

Differential Effects of Trans and Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids on Ischemia/ Reperfusion Injury and its Associated Cardiovascular Disease States	CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN			English	Article						Ischemia; fatty acid; apoptosis; heart disease; reperfusion; atherosclerosis; trans fat; omega-3 fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid	ALPHA-LINOLENIC ACID; EICOSAPENTAENOIC ACID; ECCENTRIC EXERCISE; DIETARY FLAXSEED; RISK-FACTORS; FISH-OIL; ATHEROSCLEROSIS; INFLAMMATION; OMEGA-3-FATTY-ACIDS; INHIBIT	Fatty acids have an important role in providing energy for sustained contractile activity and viability of the heart. However, considerable evidence now supports a role for fatty acids in the modulation of cardiovascular pathology as well. This may be beneficial or detrimental due to the structural differences in the various fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids appear to provide important protection to the heart during ischemic reperfusion challenge. Conversely, trans fatty acids are thought to mediate detrimental cardiac effects. Potentially pathological features of ischemic cardiomyocytes may be manifested as qualitative findings in studies of myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis. These general conclusions, however, are complicated by opposing effects that different fatty acids have even within the same group (i. e. n-6 versus n-3 fatty acids within the polyunsaturated fatty acids group, and industrial versus ruminant trans fats). Understanding more about how these fatty acid species alter ischemic myocardial injury is an increasingly attractive area of research. The identification of further targets of fatty acid interactions has great potential to provide valuable information for the modulation of cardiovascular disease.

Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted an experiment with a simple gamification application that the authors added to a given information system and compared the work performance of an experimental group (n = 16) with a control group (n = 15) over a period of one month. Findings The results of the authors' experiment show that gamification of the workplace leads to a measurable improvement of work performance, creates prevailingly positive emotions and increases the motivation of the workers. Research limitations/implications The authors' findings provide reasons for conducting future research on the contiguity of gamification and the Hawthorne effect or similar phenomena. In this regard, it also seems necessary to take a closer look at who is really affected by a gamified environment and what the boundaries of the gamified environment are. Practical implications The authors demonstrate that gamification is a useful tool for process improvement. Furthermore, our results are helpful for a more successful implementation of gamification. Originality/value Gamification has proven to be effective in a large number of application contexts, such as education, health and crowdsourcing. Despite the generally positive evaluation of its effectiveness, gamification is still thought to work differently in different contexts. Therefore, there is a gap in the literature on this topic with respect to real industrial workplaces. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the authors are among the first to have conducted a gamification experiment in a real industrial context.

This is in particular essential for an automated emergency vehicle preemption system, where traffic signal preemption should be more accurate, smooth, and safe. Current researches for ITS middleware do not give much thought on interoperability and performance. Thus they cannot support such automation framework. This paper proposes Bevor, an ITS middleware for emergency vehicle preemption based on National Transportation Communications for ITS Protocol (NTCIP). By utilizing NTCIP protocols in Communication Layer, Bevor achieves communication and data interoperability across most devices and equipments. The deployment of NTCIP STMF also significantly improved the effectiveness of transmission. The Service Layer of Bevor is designed with the Web 2.0 framework and XML exchange, enabling easy access to data as well as operations such as event detection, policy matching, etc. A prototype system was implemented, and the experimental results show that Bevor offers a great interoperability, more flexible automation control, reuse, and improved performance.

T was found to have some influences on the mechanical properties, and the PBX at 298 K was considered with better mechanical properties. By radial distribution function g(r) analysis the three types of hydrogen bonds, H center dot center dot center dot O, H center dot center dot center dot F, and H center dot center dot center dot Cl were predicted as the main interaction formats between F-2314 and epsilon-CL-20, and the strength of these interactions changed with temperature changing. The isotropic properties of the PBX increased with W% increasing, but each modulus and E-bind did not monotonously vary with W% increasing. The detonation properties of the PBX decreased with the increasing W%, and the PBX with 4.69% F-2314 was regarded with good detonation properties. The existence of crystal defects (vacancy or adulteration) might increase the elasticity but destabilize the system to some extent, and the mechanical properties of PBX were chiefly determined by the main body explosive. The above information was thought guidable for practical formulation design of PBX. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A qualitative observational study	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							PATIENTS PREFERENCES; HEALTH-CARE; PARTICIPATION; INVOLVEMENT; INFORMATION; LITERACY; MEDICINE; CANCER; WARD	Objective: To explore the interactions concerning the frail and elderly patients having to do with discharge from acute hospital wards and their participation in medical decision-making. The views of the patients and the medical staff were both investigated. Design: A qualitative observational and interview study using the grounded theory. Setting and participants: The setting was three hospitals in rural and urban areas of two counties in Sweden of which one was a teaching hospital. The data comprised observations, healthcare staff interviews and patient interviews. The selected patients were all about to be informed that they were going to be discharged. Results: The patients were seldom invited to participate in the decision-making regarding discharge. Generally, most communications regarding discharge were between the doctor and the nurse, after which the patient was simply informed about the decision. It was observed that the discharge information was often given in an indirect way as if other, albeit absent, people were responsible for the decision. Interviews with the healthcare staff revealed their preoccupation with the need to free up beds: 'thinking about discharge planning all the time' was the core category. This focus not only failed to fulfil the complex needs of elderly patients, it also generated feelings of frustration and guilt in the staff, and made the patients feel unwelcome. Conclusions: Frail elderly patients often did not participate in the medical decision-making regarding their discharge from hospital. The staff was highly focused on patients getting rapidly discharged, which made it difficult to fulfil the complex needs of these patients.

J	Davinson, N; Sillence, E				Davinson, Nicola; Sillence, Elizabeth			Using the health belief model to explore users' perceptions of 'being safe and secure' in the world of technology mediated financial transactions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article						Security perceptions; Behaviour change; Internet; ATM; Technology mediated communication; Health belief model	PAST BEHAVIOR; FEAR APPEALS; INFORMATION; INTERNET; MESSAGES; PASSWORD; HABIT; AUTHENTICATION; INTENTIONS; EVERYDAY	Fraudulent transactions occurring via the Internet or Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) present a considerable problem for financial institutions and consumers alike. Whilst a number of technological improvements have helped reduce the likelihood of security breaches, users themselves have an integral role to play in reducing technology mediated fraud. This paper focuses on the role of the user, specifically capturing information about their perceptions and behaviour when using technology to complete financial transactions. Semi-structured interviews with twenty-nine participants were conducted to increase knowledge and understanding in this domain. The findings are guided by the components of the health belief model (HBM) which is used as a framework for exploring critical issues associated with behavioural change. Results indicate that users typically felt safe and secure whilst conducting financial transactions online and at the ATM. The users' perceived level of threat was low mainly because they thought it unlikely that they would be a victim of fraud and because of a reduced sense of responsibility for any negative outcomes. Whilst users were aware at a superficial level of what fraudulent activities take place they were less sure about behaviours designed to counteract fraud and their potential efficacy. Furthermore, security concerns among ATM users were not as high as concerns among Internet users with Internet users appearing to take more individual responsibility for their more personal technologies in more private spaces. The paper concludes with some practical implications based around the HBM suggesting user focused ways forward for encouraging secure behaviour. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent studies have reported that ncRNAs-derived micropeptides/microproteins have regulatory functions on various biological and oncological processes. Some of these micropeptides/microproteins act as tumor inhibitors and some as tumor inducers. Understanding the carcinogenic role of ncRNAs-encoded micropeptides/microproteins seems to pose potential challenges to cancer research and offer promising practical perspectives on cancer treatment. In this review, we summarized the present information on the association of ncRNAs-derived micropeptides/microproteins with different types of human cancers. We also mentioned their carcinogenic mechanisms in cancer metabolism, signaling pathways, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and so on. Finally, we discussed the potential clinical value of these micropeptides/ microproteins and their potential use in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. This information may help discover, optimize, and develop new tools based on biological micropeptides/microproteins for the early diagnosis and development of anticancer drugs.

J	Jin, H; Jiang, HL; Ibrahim, S; Liao, XF				Jin, Hai; Jiang, Honglei; Ibrahim, Shadi; Liao, Xiaofei			Inaccuracy in Private BitTorrent Measurements	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PARALLEL PROGRAMMING			English	Article						BitTorrent; Private torrent; Inaccuracy; Incentive policies; Measurements		Recently, BitTorrent communities are rapidly evolving into private torrent sites (PT). PT sites have employed several incentive rules to improve the performance and availability of the system. Many studies have been dedicated for measuring and modeling the PT systems in order to better understand the new rules and their impact on the users' behavior in order to improve the usability of the system. These studies have been performed on different PT sites that differ in their implementation of the system and in their system's user incentive rules. Therefore, current measurement findings cannot reflect accurate results and, more importantly, the current conclusions may be biased. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy of previous measurement studies on PT sites, while emphasizing the incentive rules employed and the interplay between these rules and corresponding objective factors. We evaluate the behavior regulation policies of the front-end website and the tracker and examine the semantics of provided data. Using this information we have designed a new crawling methodology and conducted a large-scale measurement study across four representative PT sites over a year. Interestingly, we find that most reported measurements have neither considered design goals, nor thought through the incentive policies and their interplay. This lack of awareness in turn may lead to inaccurate conclusions of system properties. For example, the Seeder to Leecher Ratio (SLR), which is reported in most of the available measurements, is routinely at least 16-45 % less than the real SLR because the sites ignored the "partial seeders" in their calculation. This study aims to offer fundamental insights into designing an accurate methodology when conducting measurement studies on PT sites.

PAP may increase middle ear pressure which is of interest to otologic surgeons. There is a lack of data to guide management of PAP therapy after middle ear surgery. Objective: To elucidate how otologic surgeons manage PAP in their patients after ear surgery. Study Design: A survey e-mailed to practicing members of the American Neurotology Society. Results: Among 60 respondents, the most common recommendations to patients were to avoid PAP use for 1 week (40%), return to normal use immediately (23.3%), avoid PAP for 1 month (13.3%), or avoid PAP for 1 day (13.3%) after surgery. Twenty percent of providers reported that they change their advice on the basis of the PAP pressure settings (i.e., shorter hiatus for higher settings). Among respondents, 47% think that they have patients with middle ear issues because of PAP and 13% attributed surgical failures to PAP use. One-third of providers routinely pack the Eustachian tube during surgery. Providers who attributed a negative surgical outcome to PAP use were more likely to routinely pack/plug the Eustachian tube during otologic surgery (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Treatment recommendations regarding postoperative PAP treatment for obstructive sleep apnea vary greatly among practicing otologists. Providers who think that an adverse outcome was attributed to PAP use were more likely to prophylactically plug the Eustachian tube during surgery. Future research will provide additional information which will allow a better understanding of the effect of PAP on the middle ear, especially after otologic surgery.

Alison			Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Drives Mesolimbic Dopaminergic Regions to Initiate Motivated Behavior	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS DOPAMINE; WORKING-MEMORY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; NEURAL SYSTEMS; REWARD; NEURONS; MODULATION; TASK	How does the brain translate information signaling potential rewards into motivation to get them? Motivation to obtain reward is thought to depend on the midbrain [particularly the ventral tegmental area (VTA)], the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), but it is not clear how the interactions among these regions relate to reward-motivated behavior. To study the influence of motivation on these reward-responsive regions and on their interactions, we used dynamic causal modeling to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from humans performing a simple task designed to isolate reward anticipation. The use of fMRI permitted the simultaneous measurement of multiple brain regions while human participants anticipated and prepared for opportunities to obtain reward, thus allowing characterization of how information about reward changes physiology underlying motivational drive. Furthermore, we modeled the impact of external reward cues on causal relationships within this network, thus elaborating a link between physiology, connectivity, and motivation. Specifically, our results indicated that dlPFC was the exclusive entry point of information about reward in this network, and that anticipated reward availability caused VTA activation only via its effect on the dlPFC. Anticipated reward thus increased dlPFC activation directly, whereas it influenced VTA and NAcc only indirectly, by enhancing intrinsically weak or inactive pathways from the dlPFC. Our findings of a directional prefrontal influence on dopaminergic regions during reward anticipation suggest a model in which the dlPFC integrates and transmits representations of reward to the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine systems, thereby initiating motivated behavior.

Development, implementation, and effects of an integrated web-based teaching model in a nursing ethics course	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Article						Nursing ethic; Interactive situation web-based; Ethical decision-making; Nursing students	STUDENTS; ADOPTION; ONLINE	Background: Ethical competence, which is reflected in the ability to detect ethical challenges in clinical situations and engage in deliberate thinking on ethical actions, is one of the core competencies of nursing practice. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop and implement an interactive situational e-leaming system, integrating nursing ethical decisions into a nursing ethics course, and to evaluate the effects of this course on student nurses' ethical decision-making competence. Project design: The project was designed to be carried out in two phases. In the first phase, an interactive situated e-learning system was developed and integrated into the nursing ethics course. The second phase involved implementing the course and evaluating its effects in a quasi-experimental study. The course intervention was designed for 2 h per week over one semester (18 weeks). Participants: A total of 100 two-year technical college nursing students in their second year of the program participated in the study, with 51 in the experimental group and 49 in the control group. Results: After completing the course, the students in the experimental group showed significant improvement in nursing ethical decision-making competence, including skills in "raising questions," "recognizing differences," "comparing differences," "self-dialogue," "taking action," and "identifying the implications of decisions made," compared to their performance prior to the class. After controlling for factors influencing learning effects, students in the experimental group showed superiority to those in the control group in the competency of "recognizing differences." The students in the experimental group reported that the course pushed them to search for and collect information needed to resolve the ethical dilemma. Conclusions: The interactive situational e-learning system developed by our project was helpful in developing the students' competence in ethical reasoning. The e-learning system and the situational teaching materials used in this study may be applicable in nursing and related professional ethics courses.

The neuromodulator effects of VNS are thought to activate the release of neurotransmitters involving cognition and to promote neuronal plasticity. Therefore, VNS has been studied for its effects on attention and working memory impairment in neuropsychiatric disorders. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the effects of VNS on attention and working memory among patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, examine stimulation parameters, provide mechanistic hypotheses, and propose future studies using VNS. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review using electronic databases MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane library, and PsycINFO (Ovid). Narrative analysis was used to describe the therapeutic effects of VNS on attention and working memory, describe stimulation parameters, and propose explanatory mechanisms. Results: We identified 20 studies reporting VNS effects on attention and working memory in patients with epilepsy or mood disorders. For epilepsy, there was one randomized controlled trial from all 18 studies. It demonstrated no statistically significant differences in the cognitive tasks between active and control VNS. From a within-subject experimental design, significant improvement of working memory after VNS was demonstrated. One of three nonrandomized controlled trials found significantly improved attentional performance after VNS. The cohort studies compared VNS and surgery and found attentional improvement in both groups. Nine of 12 pretest-posttest studies showed improvement of attention or working memory after VNS. For mood disorders, although one study showed significant improvement of attention following VNS, the other did not. Conclusions: This review suggests that, although we identified some positive results from eligible studies, there is insufficient good-quality evidence to establish VNS as an effective intervention to enhance attention and working memory in persons with neuropsychiatric disorders. Further studies assessing the efficacy of such intervention are needed.

The Effects of Low-Vision Rehabilitation on Reading Speed and Depression in Age Related Macular Degeneration: A Meta-Analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OLDER-ADULTS; SELF-MANAGEMENT; BURDEN; AMD	Importance Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive eye disease that, as of 2015, has affected 11 million people in the U.S. and 1.5 million in Canada causing central vision blindness. By 2050, this number is expected to double to 22 million. Eccentric vision is the target of low-vision rehabilitation aids and programs for patients with AMD, which are thought to improve functional performance by improving reading speed and depression. Objective This study evaluates the effect of various low-vision rehabilitation strategies on reading speed and depression in patients 55 and older with AMD. Data Sources Computer databases including MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), BIOSIS Previews (Thomson-Reuters), CINAHL (EBSCO), Health Economic Evaluations Database (HEED), ISI Web of Science (Thomson-Reuters) and the Cochrane Library (Wiley) were searched from the year 2000 to January 2015. Study Selection Included papers were research studies with a sample size of 20 eyes or greater focused on AMD in adults aged 55 or older with low vision (20/60 or lower). Data Extraction and Synthesis Two independent reviewers screened and extracted relevant data from the included articles. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was chosen as an effect size to perform meta-analysis using STATA. Fixed-and random-effect models were developed based on heterogeneity. Main Outcomes Reading Speed and Depression Scores. Results A total of 9 studies (885 subjects) were included. Overall, a significant improvement in reading speed was found with a SMD of 1.01 [95% CI: 0.05 to 1.97]. Low-vision rehabilitation strategies including micro-perimetric biofeedback, microscopes teaching program significantly improved reading speed. Eccentric viewing training showed the maximum improvement in reading speed. In addition, a non-significant improvement in depression scores was found with a SMD of -0.44 [95% CI: -0.96 to 0.09]. Conclusion A considerable amount of research is required in the area of low-vision rehabilitation strategies for patients with AMD. Based on current research, low-vision rehabilitation aids improve reading speed. However, they do not have a significant effect on depression scores in those 55 and older with AMD.

NF-kappa B activity is suppressed by association with the inhibitor I kappa B. Aberrant NF-kappa B signaling activity has been associated with the development of cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases and auto-immune diseases. The IKK protein complex is comprised of IKK alpha, IKK beta and NEMO subunits, with IKK beta thought to play the dominant role in modulating NF-kappa B activity. Therefore, the discovery of new IKK beta inhibitors may offer new therapeutic options for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases. Results: A structure-based molecular docking approach has been employed to discover novel IKK beta inhibitors from a natural product library of over 90,000 compounds. Preliminary screening of the 12 highest-scoring compounds using a luciferase reporter assay identified 4 promising candidates for further biological study. Among these, the benzoic acid derivative (1) showed the most promising activity at inhibiting IKK beta phosphorylation and TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappa B signaling in vitro. Conclusions: In this study, we have successfully identified a benzoic acid derivative (1) as a novel IKK beta inhibitor via high-throughput molecular docking. Compound 1 was able to inhibit IKK beta phosphorylation activity in vitro, and block I kappa B alpha protein degradation and subsequent NF-kappa B activation in human cells. Further in silico optimization of the compound is currently being conducted in order to generate more potent analogues for biological tests.

J	Luo, MY				Luo, Mengyu			The omnivore turn in cultural production: Case study of China's Rainbow Chamber Singers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES			English	Article						cultural production; omnivorousness; popular expression; participatory culture; Rainbow Chamber Singers	MUSIC; GLOBALIZATION; IDENTITY; CONSUMPTION; STATE; SELF	Previous studies on China's cultural production have concentrated on the tension between state and individual creativity, overlooking the more dynamic and popular expression in China's complicated cultural market, especially in this information age. This article is inspired by the omnivore-univore argument in cultural consumption and argues there is a similar omnivore turn among China's independent cultural producers. Drawing on a case study of the Rainbow Chamber Singers (RCS), this article provides a new dimension and perspective to examine omnivore production in China's 'unconventional' chamber choir. Data from the RCS's music, lyrics, performances, the conductor Jin Chengzhi's interviews (first-hand and second-hand), and the author's own participant observation of the RCS's concerts will be combined and elaborated. This article contends that the RCS adapts to creative thinking from creative industries and blurs conceptual boundaries between state/individual, art/commerce, and highbrow/lowbrow. The process also contributes to forming a participatory culture in the arena of classical chamber music.

J	Muksor, A; Parmar, D				Muksor, Alacrity; Parmar, Daksha			Cultural Beliefs and Practices in Self-Management of Diabetes Among Pnar Women in Meghalaya, India	SCIENCE OF DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT AND CARE			English	Article							STRATEGIES; ILLNESS	Purpose: The purpose of the study was to explore the cultural beliefs and practices of the Pnar tribe in terms of their self-management of diabetes. Methods: A qualitative study design using an ethnographic approach was adopted to understand the experiences of the Pnar women with type 2 diabetes. Around 60 women living with diabetes across 20 villages in the Thadlaskein rural block were interviewed in the Pnar language. Thematic analysis was employed to identify the pattern related to beliefs and cultural practices in the self-management of diabetes across the data set. Results: Misconceptions related to diet, such as all vegetables grown underground need to be avoided and bitter herbs and vegetables are good for blood glucose control, were reported. Participants used home remedies and complementary and alternative medicine to bring down their blood glucose levels. Participants believe that diabetes is an episodic or short-term illness and can be cured through herbal medicine. Participants reported that consuming atta or round flat bread made of wheat flour instead of rice caused "acidity." Conclusions: Misconceptions are barriers to disease management, which are often shaped in people's minds by culture. Therefore, health care service providers must know what people think about diabetes and its management. Accordingly, information related to diabetes should be disseminated to the masses for effective management of diabetes.

Nurses need to help individuals identify and meet these needs. However, sometimes their perception of sexuality can affect their attitudes towards care. The aim of this study determine the effect of sexual self-schema and sexual embarrassment on attitudes and beliefs related to sexual health in nursing students. Background: The sexual self-schema, which emphasizes the cognitive aspect of sexuality, is defined as cognitive generalizations that a person does for her/his own sexuality. Sexual self-schemas are known to affect individuals' feelings, beliefs and attitudes towards sexuality. Those with a positive sexual self-schema experience less embarrassment and more positive attitudes towards sexuality. Those with a negative sexual self-schema experience more sexual embarrassment. Those who experience sexual embarrassment have an avoidance of sexual interaction and talking about sexual issues. Nurses and student nurses have embarrassed to talk about sexuality with their patients. It is thought that sexual attitudes and beliefs are effective on this situation. Design: This study was conducted in a cross-sectional descriptive type. Structural equality model was established to test the hypotheses of the research. In the model, the direct effects of the sexual self-schema and the sexual embarrassment on sexual attitudes and beliefs were examined. In addition, the mediating effect of sexual embarrassment between sexual schemas and sexual attitudes and beliefs is also included in the model. Methods: The study population was the students who attended to and conducted clinical practice at the second, third and fourth study year at a Faculty of Health Sciences. For data collection, the Introductory Information Form which questioned socio-demographic characteristics of individuals, Sexual Self-Schema Scale (SSS), Sexual Embarrassment Scale (SES), and Sexual Attitudes and Beliefs Survey for Sexual Health (SABS) were used. The data were collected online with voluntary participation. Results: Students' average scale scores were: SSS: 121.57 +/- 21.23, SES: 12.16 +/- 5.74 and SABS: 35.62 +/- 7.53. It was also found that sexual self-schemas and sexual embarrassment effected sexual attitudes and beliefs. Conclusion: It could be recommended that these results be tested with different studies, that the course content on sexual issues be reviewed be addressed in a broader context.

Inspired from the natural image captioning, the model with convolutional neural network (CNN)-Recurrent neural network (RNN) as the backbone and supplemented by attention has been widely used in remote sensing image captioning. However, it is inefficient for the current attention layer to simultaneously mine hidden foreground from the background of remote sensing image and perform feature interactive learning. Meanwhile, the new mainstream language model has recently surpassed the traditional long short-term memory (LSTM) in sentence generation. For solving the above problems, in this article, we proposed a novel thought to make the flat remote sensing images stereoscopic by separating the foreground and background. Based on hierarchical image information, we designed a novel Deformable Transformer equipped with deformable scaled dot-product attention to learn multiscale feature from foreground and background through the powerful interactive learning ability. Evaluations are conducted on four classic remote sensing image captioning datasets. Compared with the state-of-theart methods, our Transformer variant achieves higher captioning accuracy.

J	Teramae, JN; Fukai, T				Teramae, Jun-nosuke; Fukai, Tomoki			Local cortical circuit model inferred from power-law distributed neuronal avalanches	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neuronal wiring; synchronization; cell assembly; synfire chain; cortical network development	NEURAL-NETWORKS; SYNCHRONOUS SPIKING; CORRELATED ACTIVITY; PROPAGATION; DYNAMICS; MICROCIRCUIT; PATTERNS	How cortical neurons process information crucially depends on how their local circuits are organized. Spontaneous synchronous neuronal activity propagating through neocortical slices displays highly diverse, yet repeatable, activity patterns called "neuronal avalanches". They obey power-law distributions of the event sizes and lifetimes, presumably reflecting the structure of local circuits developed in slice cultures. However, the explicit network structure underlying the power-law statistics remains unclear. Here, we present a neuronal network model of pyramidal and inhibitory neurons that enables stable propagation of avalanche-like spiking activity. We demonstrate a neuronal wiring rule that governs the formation of mutually overlapping cell assemblies during the development of this network. The resultant network comprises a mixture of feedforward chains and recurrent circuits, in which neuronal avalanches are stable if the former structure is predominant. Interestingly, the recurrent synaptic connections formed by this wiring rule limit the number of cell assemblies embeddable in a neuron pool of given size. We investigate how the resultant power laws depend on the details of the cell-assembly formation as well as on the inhibitory feedback. Our model suggests that local cortical circuits may have a more complex topological design than has previously been thought.

Further, by following the sociotype's conceptual guidelines, a new psychometric indicator has been developed in order to gauge the level of social interaction around each individual-the sociotype questionnaire (SOCQ). A first version of this questionnaire has been elaborated by gathering data about the different classes of social bonds (family, friends, acquaintances, and work/study colleagues) in general population and about the dynamic update of these bonds via face-to-face conversation and other modes of interaction. A specific fieldwork was undertaken, involving 1,075 participants, all of them Spanish adults (with diverse social and regional backgrounds). The data obtained were analyzed by means of the correlational method with an analytical cross-sectional design: the number of factors and the consistency and reliability of the resulting scales were evaluated and correlated. The new sociotype indicator resulting from that fieldwork, in spite of its limitations, seems to be valid and reliable, as well as closely associated with widely used metrics of loneliness and psychological distress. It is interesting that the construct noticeably varies throughout the life course and circumstances of individuals, based on their gender and age, and adjusting to the different situations of social networking. This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, which has tried to reach both a theoretical and an operational formulation of the sociotype construct, by establishing an ad hoc psychometric questionnaire. We think that the information provided by this operational definition opens a new direction of work that could be useful to guide the development and evaluation of programs aimed at improving and strengthening social networking in people at risk, especially for the elderly.

A Typology of Web Survey Paradata for Assessing Total Survey Error	SOCIAL SCIENCE COMPUTER REVIEW			English	Article						web surveys; paradata; total survey error	CLIENT-SIDE PARADATA; MOBILE WEB; RESPONSE QUALITY; QUESTION FORMATS; PC WEB; DEVICES	This article reviews the existing literature on the collection of paradata in web surveys and extends the research in this area beyond the commonly studied measurement error problem to paradata that can be collected for managing and mitigating other important sources of error. To do so, and in keeping with the nature of paradata as process-oriented, we develop a typology of web survey paradata that incorporates information from all steps in the web survey process. We first define web survey paradata and describe general phases of paradata that run parallel to the steps in fielding a typical web survey. Within each phase, we enumerate several errors within the total survey error paradigm that can be examined with paradata, discussing case studies and motivating examples that illustrate innovative uses of paradata across the web survey process. We conclude with a discussion of open questions and opportunities for further work in this area. Overall, we develop this typology keeping technological advancements at the center of our discussion, but with flexibility to continuously incorporate new developments and trends in both technology and study design. Our typology encourages researchers to think about paradata as tools that can be used to investigate a broader range of outcomes than previously studied.

In most mammalian species, information regarding sex, age and other species-specific social and reproductive characteristics is conveyed by pheromones, which are detected by the vomeronasal and olfactory systems. Traditionally, pheromone signals have been thought to possess intrinsic rewarding meanings and to trigger 'innate' hardwired social behavioural responses. In contrast, odorants are considered to possess mostly neutral reward value, but may induce approach or avoidance behaviours as a result of experience or through conditioning following pairing with stimuli that possess intrinsic rewarding properties. This review describes studies demonstrating that innate behavioural responses, with particular emphasis on reproductive responses mediated by pheromonal signals, are actually flexible and substantially influenced by past experience and associative learning. These attributes allow the animal to assign new motivational incentives to pheromones associated with social and reproductive behaviours, thus providing adaptive ability to cope with unique changes in internal and external environmental conditions. We argue that responses to pheromones are far more easily modified by experience than would be expected from hardwired innate responses, and that the behaviours they elicit are chiefly plastic and sensitive to modification throughout life by sensory-mediated emotional experience.

The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) provides opportunities for demand management of sexual and reproductive health services. Conversational agents/chatbots are increasingly common, although little is known about how this technology could aid services. This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators for engagement with sexual health chatbots to advise service developers and related health professionals. Methods. In January-June 2020, we conducted face-to-face, semi-structured and online interviews to explore views on sexual health chatbots. Participants were asked to interact with a chatbot, offering advice on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and relevant services. Participants were UK-based and recruited via social media. Data were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Results. Forty participants (aged 18-50 years; 64% women, 77% heterosexual, 58% white) took part. Many thought chatbots could aid sex education, providing useful information about STIs and sign-posting to sexual health services in a convenient, anonymous and non-judgemental way. Some compared chatbots to health professionals or Internet search engines and perceived this technology as inferior, offering constrained content and interactivity, limiting disclosure of personal information, trust and perceived accuracy of chatbot responses. Conclusions. Despite mixed attitudes towards chatbots, this technology was seen as useful for anonymous sex education but less suitable for matters requiring empathy. Chatbots may increase access to clinical services but their effectiveness and safety need to be established. Future research should identify which chatbots designs and functions lead to optimal engagement with this innovation.

Breaking the waves:: improved detection of copy number variation from microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization	GENOME BIOLOGY			English	Article							MODELS	Background: Large-scale high throughput studies using microarray technology have established that copy number variation ( CNV) throughout the genome is more frequent than previously thought. Such variation is known to play an important role in the presence and development of phenotypes such as HIV-1 infection and Alzheimer's disease. However, methods for analyzing the complex data produced and identifying regions of CNV are still being refined. Results: We describe the presence of a genome-wide technical artifact, spatial autocorrelation or 'wave', which occurs in a large dataset used to determine the location of CNV across the genome. By removing this artifact we are able to obtain both a more biologically meaningful clustering of the data and an increase in the number of CNVs identified by current calling methods without a major increase in the number of false positives detected. Moreover, removing this artifact is critical for the development of a novel model-based CNV calling algorithm - CNVmix - that uses cross-sample information to identify regions of the genome where CNVs occur. For regions of CNV that are identified by both CNVmix and current methods, we demonstrate that CNVmix is better able to categorize samples into groups that represent copy number gains or losses. Conclusion: Removing artifactual 'waves' ( which appear to be a general feature of array comparative genomic hybridization ( aCGH) datasets) and using cross-sample information when identifying CNVs enables more biological information to be extracted from aCGH experiments designed to investigate copy number variation in normal individuals.

Here we employed connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) to predict the intelligence quotient (IQ) scores for 166 males and 160 females separately, using resting-state functional connectivity, grey matter cortical thickness or both. The identified multimodal, IQ-predictive imaging features were then compared between genders. CPM showed high out-of-sample prediction accuracy (r > 0.34), and integrating both functional and structural features further improved prediction accuracy by capturing complementary information (r = 0.45). Male IQ demonstrated higher correlations with cortical thickness in theleftinferior parietal lobule, and with functional connectivity in left parahippocampus and default mode network, regions previously implicated in spatial cognition and logical thinking. In contrast, female IQ was more correlated with cortical thickness in therightinferior parietal lobule, and with functional connectivity in putamen and cerebellar networks, regions previously implicated in verbal learning and item memory. Results suggest that the intelligence generation of males and females may rely on opposite cerebral lateralized key brain regions and distinct functional networks consistent with their respective superiority in cognitive domains. Promisingly, understanding the neural basis of gender differences underlying intelligence may potentially lead to optimized personal cognitive developmental programs and facilitate advancements in unbiased educational test design.

Method: The study included 674 participants (citizens and residents in Saudi Arabia) who were randomly contacted via email and social media and gave their consent to complete a questionnaire dealing with 39 items that can be clustered in six parts. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square for cross-tabulation were generated using SPSS. Results: Among the 664 participants, 73.4% believed that there are some positive and negative outcomes of psychotropic medication. Participants (72.0%) think that the most important reason leading to psychological disorders is mainly due to the loss of a relative or beloved person, and 73.9% considered psychic session as one of the possible treatments of psychological disorders. Surprisingly, only 18.8% of the participants agreed that medicinal and aromatic plants could be a possible treatment of the psychological disorder. Participants (82%) consider that physicians are the most trustful and preferred source of information about alternative and complementary medicine.

J	Farrell, K; Ferguson, E; James, V; Lowe, KC				Farrell, K; Ferguson, E; James, V; Lowe, KC			Public perception of the risk of HIV infection associated with blood donation: the role of contextual cues	TRANSFUSION			English	Article							TRANSFUSION; ATTITUDES; AIDS	BACKGROUND: Previous surveys have reported that a high proportion of people believe that HIV can be contracted through donating blood. It was hypothesized that this may reflect an artifact of the survey methods used. This study was therefore designed to test the hypothesis that providing contextual cues specific to HIV would cause respondents to express an increased belief that the virus can be contracted by donating blood. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A one-way, between-group design was used to test this hypothesis. Adult subjects (n = 168) were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions, all three groups receiving information about the small risk of infection from blood transfusion. The variation across the experimental conditions was the example of infection given (i.e., Condition 1 = no specific example of infection risk, Condition 2 = data on the small risk of contracting hepatitis C through transfusion, Condition 3 = data on the low risk of contracting HIV through transfusion). Respondents answered a single question, "Do you think you could catch HIV by giving (donating) blood in the UK?'' RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis revealed that respondents in the HIV-cued condition were almost 11 times (OR = 10.6) more likely to answer "Yes" to the survey question, as compared with the no-cue condition. There was no significant difference in response between the no-cue and the hepatitis C-cue conditions. CONCLUSION: Providing contextual cues relating to HIV increased the expressed belief that the virus could be contracted through donating blood. To better develop donor recruitment policies, future survey tools should minimize contextual effects.

J	Maclean, N; Pound, P; Wolfe, C; Rudd, A				Maclean, N; Pound, P; Wolfe, C; Rudd, A			Qualitative analysis of stroke patients' motivation for rehabilitation	BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							ILLNESS	Objective To explore the attitudes and beliefs of stroke patients identified by professionals as having either "high" or "low" motivation for rehabilitation. Design Qualitative study with semistructured interviews. Setting The stroke unit of an inner city teaching hospital. Participants 22 patients with stroke who were undergoing rehabilitation; 14 with high motivation for rehabilitation and eight with low motivation. Results All patients thought rehabilitation was important for recovery. High motivation patients were more likely to view rehabilitation as the most important means of recovery and to accord themselves an active role in rehabilitation. These patients were also more likely to understand rehabilitation and in particular to understand the specialist role of the nursing staff, Many patients reported independence at home as a personal goal, though few low motivation patients related this goal to success in rehabilitation. Information from professionals about rehabilitation, favourable comparisons with Other stroke patients, and the desire to leave hospital had a positive effect on motivation. Conversely overprotection from family members and professionals, lack of information or the receipt of "mixed messages" from professionals, and unfavourable comparisons with other patients had a negative effect. Conclusions There are some differences in beliefs between stroke patients identified as having low or high motivation for rehabilitation. These beliefs seem to be influenced by the environment in which the patient is rehabilitated. Professionals and carers should be made a aware of the ways in which their behaviour can positively and negatively affect motivation.

Surprisingly, despite this importance, a number of gaps exist in our knowledge of NaCl-induced apoplastic pH alkalinization. This study was designed in order to shed light onto the mechanisms responsible for the initiation and transiency of leaf apoplastic alkalinization under conditions of NaCl stress as supplied to roots. An H+-sensitive fluorescence probe, in combination with ratiometric microscopy imaging, was used for inplanta live recording of leaf apoplastic pH. The use of a nonionic solute demonstrated that the alkalinization is induced in response to ionic, and not osmotic, components of NaCl stress. Tests with Cl- or Na+-accompanying counter-ions strengthened the idea that the stress factor itself, namely Cl, is transferred from root to shoot and elicits the pH alterations. Investigations with a plasma membrane ATPase inhibitor suggest that ATPase activity influences the course of the alkalinization by having a shaping re-acidifying effect on the alkalinization.

Entry to practice nursing students' experiences of debriefing during clinical practice: A qualitative meta-synthesis*	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Review						Debriefing; Experiences; Nursing education; Perceptions; Qualitative meta -synthesis; Student nurse	BEHAVIORS; EDUCATION; ETHICS; HEALTH	Objectives: The objectives of this review were to identify, explore and synthesize existing evidence in the literature of nursing students' experiences of debriefing in their clinical practice placements. Design: Qualitative meta-synthesis.Data sources: Databases included Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Education Resources Information Centre, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, and Scopus. Qualitative studies were considered for inclusion if published in English, reporting primary data analysis including experiences of nursing students. The final search was conducted on 22 October 2021, no time limit was applied.Review methods: Qualitative studies were identified and appraised. Across the included studies, authors' themes and metaphors, and participant quotes were inductively analysed and interpreted, then expressed in the synthesis.Results: Three new themes representing nursing students' experiences of debriefing were constructed. Theme one, 'It didn't happen formally, but I needed it', included students expressing the value of, and wanting to be involved in, debriefing to gain validation, reassurance, and guidance. Theme two, 'I had to release it and it helped' included students' positive experiences of debriefing with another student, nurse, or confidant, through various modalities. These experiences affirmed they were not alone in their feelings, which provided relief, confidence, and new ways of thinking and practicing. Theme three, 'Strengthened clinical experience and learning', included students feeling debriefing supported their awareness and understanding of practice and increased participation in clinical experiences. This awareness and understanding provided an opportunity for students to explore, and reflect on, the impact of patient care.Conclusions: Through debriefing student nurses found relief, confidence, and new ways of thinking through a shared understanding. Debriefing supported student learning and the clinical-academic education team had a key role in creating this opportunity.

Digital weight loss interventions have adopted mobile technology primarily in order to support self-monitoring. However, many available apps are not designed as a part of dietetic practice; therefore, a distinct gap in the research exists relating to technology that supports the patient-practitioner relationship. This paper presents myPace, which is a complete weight loss and management system that is deployed via a smartphone and a PC. It connects dietitians and patients between face-to-face consultations and extends the relationship through patients' regular progress updates and dietitians' tailored and timely advice, for sustained behavior change. The prototype was developed from research into behavior change for weight loss, which furthermore was underpinned by theory and tenets of human support models, such as the supportive accountability framework. We report on an early-phase system design goals via a formative research process, which aimed to implement theoretical principles and match practical dietetic practice. To that end, only the clinical end user's perspective was sought through a coaching think-aloud protocol on the first iteration of the prototype and interviews with dietitians.

An indicator-display monitoring task was performed under different experimental conditions for SA model verification, while the SA global assessment technique (SAGAT), performance measures, 10-dimensional SA rating technique (10-D SART), and eye movement measures were adopted to comprehensively assess the operator's SA. The experimental results revealed that theoretical prediction values calculated using the improved SA model were strongly correlated with the operation performance, and thus confirming the model validation. The SAGAT was shown to be a more effective method than SART in this research, and the overall SAGAT accuracy rate, as well as the accuracy response time, are effective indices for SA measurement. Eye-movement indices, such as the fixation/saccade ratio, which corresponds to the mode of information perception and extraction, was examined to be sensitive to operator's SA changes. The Advances of the improved SA model have been achieved in predicting and indicating SA by using human behaviors, including operation performance, SAGAT response behaviors, and visual behaviors. Thereby, it provides a new auxiliary tool for quantitative characterization of pilot's SA during cockpit interface design optimization and ergonomic evaluation.

Starting from the work of Barzilai and Borwein (1988), many efficient steplength rules have been designed, that contributed to make the gradient approaches an effective tool for the large-scale optimization problems arising in important real-world applications. Most of these steplength rules have been thought in unconstrained optimization, with the aim of exploiting some second-order information for achieving a fast annihilation of the gradient of the objective function. However, these rules are successfully used also within gradient projection methods for constrained optimization, though, to our knowledge, a detailed analysis of the effects of the constraints on the steplength selections is still not available. In this work we investigate how the presence of the box constraints affects the spectral properties of the Barzilai-Borwein rules in quadratic programming problems. The proposed analysis suggests the introduction of new steplength selection strategies specifically designed for taking account of the active constraints at each iteration. The results of a set of numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the new rules with respect to other state of the art steplength selections and their potential usefulness also in case of box-constrained non-quadratic optimization problems.

Existing approaches have exposed their limitations in terms of accuracy, robustness, simplicity, or efficiency. To tackle this tough problem, a simple yet effective translation averaging pipeline, termed as Incremental Translation Averaging (ITA), is proposed in this paper. It combines the advantages of high accuracy and robustness in incremental parameter estimation pipeline and the advantages of high simplicity and efficiency in global motion averaging approach. Unlike the traditional translation averaging methods which estimate all the absolute camera locations simultaneously and suffer from inaccuracy in parameter estimation and incompleteness in scene reconstruction, our ITA computes them novelly in an incremental way with higher accuracy and robustness. Thanks to the introduction of incremental parameter estimation thought into the translation averaging pipeline, 1) our ITA is robust to measurement outliers and accurate in parameter estimation; and 2) our ITA is simple and efficient because of its less dependency on complicated optimization, carefully-designed preprocessing, or additional information. Comprehensive evaluations on the 1DSfM dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our ITA and its advantages over several state-of-the-art translation averaging approaches.

To explore different dimensions of tinnitus-related thoughts, a 22-item self-report measure, the Tinnitus Cognitions Scale (T-Cog), is presented. Furthermore, dysfunctional cognitions are examined as a possible mediator of the relation between tinnitus distress and depression. Design: The present study analyzes the cross-sectional data of 373 patients with chronic tinnitus. Parallel analysis and principal axis factoring are used to identify the factor structure of the T-Cog. Assumed mediating effects are tested using the asymptotic and resampling procedure. Results: Factor analysis reveals two factors interpreted as tinnitus-related catastrophic thinking and tinnitus-related avoidance cognitions. Internal consistency is sufficient with a Cronbach's of 0.88 for the total scale and 0.74 and 0.87 for the subscales. The authors find high associations between the T-Cog and other measures of tinnitus distress, depression, anxiety, and tinnitus acceptance, indicating convergent validity. With the exception of neuroticism, low correlations with personality factors are found, indicating discriminant validity. Patients with moderate or severe tinnitus distress report significantly higher scores of dysfunctional cognitions than patients with mild tinnitus distress. Tinnitus-related catastrophic thinking and tinnitus-related avoidance cognitions partially mediate the relation between tinnitus distress and depression. Conclusions: Dysfunctional cognitions can play an important role in the degree of tinnitus distress. Catastrophic and avoidant thoughts contribute to the explanation of depression among tinnitus patients. The T-Cog is a reliable and valid questionnaire for the assessment of different dimensions of cognitions. Its use could provide information for identifying tinnitus patients who are particularly suitable for cognitive-behavioral therapy.

J	Hassani, P; Abdi, A; Jalali, R; Salari, N				Hassani, Parkhide; Abdi, Alireza; Jalali, Rostam; Salari, Nader			The perception of intuition in clinical practice by Iranian critical care nurses: a phenomenological study	PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH AND BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						intuition; nurses; critical care; qualitative research	NURSING-STUDENTS; WARD; TOOL	Background: Intuition as a way of learning in nursing is applied to decision making and judgment in complicated clinical situations. Several studies have been conducted on intuition in clinical settings, but comprehension of this concept is unclear. Moreover, there is a lack of information about intuition in critical care nurses caring for more seriously ill patients. This study aimed to explore Iranian critical care nurses' understanding of intuition in clinical practice. Methods: In a descriptive-phenomenological study, 12 nurses employed in critical care units of the hospitals affiliated to Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences were purposively recruited to the study. A semistructured interview was administered, and then written verbatim. The data were managed by MAXQDA 10 software, and qualitative analysis was undertaken using the seven-stage approach of Colaizzi. Results: Of the 12 nurses who participated in the study, 7 (58.3%) were female and married, and 10 (88.3%) held a bachelor's degree in nursing. The mean and standard deviations of participants' age, job experience, and critical care experience were 36.66 +/- 7.01, 13.75 +/- 6.82, and 7.66 +/- 3.36 years, respectively. Four main themes and eleven sub-themes were elicited from the qualitative analysis; the main themes including "Understanding intuition as a feeling", "Understanding intuition as a thought", "Understanding intuition as receiving signs", and "Understanding intuition as an alarm". Because they have trust in their own intuition, the nurses made further assessments and paid more attention to patients. They were also better prepared after receiving intuition alarms to perform the appropriate responses, and acting upon the alarms reduced the nurses' physical and psychological signs. Conclusion: The findings showed how intuition was understood by the critical care nurses; therefore, these results can be considered to form a theoretical basis for designing other studies. Because of the significant role of intuition in enhancing the nursing care of critically ill patients, it is suggested that more qualitative, quantitative, and trials studies be performed to reinforce intuition in nursing; moreover, to incorporate intuition into nursing curriculums, it should be debated in academic settings.

In this study, online news and related public comments on the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis), one of China's flagship species, was collected and evaluated to determine the performance of media news releases in strengthening public awareness. Media releases on the incidents of dolphins straying into freshwater systems at Dongping, Beijiang, and Baisha Rivers, in the Pearl River Delta of China were examined. WeChat, the largest social networking platform in China, was used as the data source. Generalized linear model (GLM) was used to test the news popularity by publisher type, title tone, picture counts, and word counts. Content analysis (CA) was used for mining wildlife conservation information in articles and identifying public opinions. GLM results showed that three publishers (traditional, governmental and private) as well as articles with more pictures attracted greater online readerships. CA results showed that articles were unable to popularize wildlife conservation knowledge, and the public was highly doubtful about conservation efforts by the government and experts. The finding here suggests that greater attention is needed for depicting and delivering conservation knowledge (e.g., rescue methods, biological features), negative impact on wildlife by diverse human behavior, and detailed proper descriptions to promote public awareness on wildlife conservation using multi-faceted thinking so as to reduce public misunderstanding of policymakers and experts. A. suggested concerted framework could help strengthen wildlife management through social media.

Evidence from previous epidemiological studies show that GPs are recording drug misuse in electronic patient records (EPR). However, although the recording trends are similar to national surveys, recording rates are much lower. Aim To explore the factors that influence GPs to record drug misuse in the EPR, and to gain a clearer understanding of the gap between the amount of drug misuse recorded in primary care and that in national surveys and other studies. Design and setting A semi-structured qualitative interview study of GPs working in general practices across England. Method Purposive sampling was employed to recruit 12 GPs, both with and without a special interest in drug misuse, from across England. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted to consider whether and why GPs record drug misuse, which methods GPs use for recording, GPs' actions if a patient asks for the information not to be recorded, and GPs' actions if they think a patient misuses drugs but does not disclose the information. Resulting data were analysed using a combination of inductive and deductive thematic analysis. Results The complexity of asking about drug misuse preceded GPs' decision to record. They described how the context of the general practice protocols, interaction between GP and patient, and the questioning process affected whether, how, and in which circumstances they asked about drug use. This led to GPs making a clinical decision on whether, who, and how to record in the EPR. Conclusion When making decisions about whether or not to record drug misuse, GPs face complex choices. Aside from their own views, they reported feelings of pressure from the general practice environment in which they worked and their clinical commissioning group, as well as government policies.

J	Zanaboni, P; Fagerlund, AJ				Zanaboni, Paolo; Fagerlund, Asbjorn Johansen			Patients' use and experiences with e-consultation and other digital health services with their general practitioner in Norway: results from an online survey	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							PRIMARY-CARE; COMMUNICATION; EMAIL; SATISFACTION; PHYSICIAN; SYSTEM	Objectives To explore patients' use and experiences with four digital health services implemented in Norway to enable electronic communication between patients and their general practitioner (GP): (1) electronic booking of appointments; (2) electronic prescription renewal; (3) electronic contact with the GP's office for non-clinical inquiries; and (4) e-consultation for clinical inquiries. Design An online survey consisting of quantitative data supplemented by qualitative information was conducted to explore: (1) characteristics of the users; (2) use; (3) experiences, perceived benefits and satisfaction; and (4) time spent using the digital health services. Setting Primary care. Participants 2043 users of the digital health services answering the survey. Results There was a higher proportion of women, younger adults and digitally active citizens with high education. Electronic booking of appointments was the most used service (66.4%), followed by electronic prescription renewal (54.3%). Most users (80%) could more easily and efficiently book an appointment electronically than by phone. Over 90% of the respondents thought that it was easier to renew a prescription electronically, 76% obtained a better overview of their medications and 46% reported higher compliance. For non-clinical inquiries, most respondents (60%) thought that it was easier to write electronic messages than communicate by phone. For clinical enquiries, many patients agreed that e-consultation could lead to a better followup (72%) and improved quality of treatment (58%). Users were highly satisfied with the services and recommended their use to others. Time saving was the most evident benefit for patients. This was confirmed by the differences in time spent using the digital health services compared with conventional approaches, all found to be statistically significant. Conclusion Citizens using e-consultation and other digital health services with their GP in Norway are satisfied and consider them as useful and efficient alternatives to conventional approaches.

This study is explicitly designed to discriminate among the proposed explanations for initial responses in centipede games. Using many different centipede games, our approach determines endogenously whether one or more explanations are empirically relevant. We find that non-equilibrium behavior is too heterogeneous to be explained by a single model. However, most non-equilibrium choices can be fully explained by level-k thinking and quantal response equilibrium but each model for different subjects. Preference-based models play a negligible role in explaining nonequilibrium play. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Eye gaze patterns reveal how reasoning skills improve with experience	NPJ SCIENCE OF LEARNING			English	Article								Reasoning, our ability to solve novel problems, has been shown to improve as a result of learning experiences. However, the underlying mechanisms of change in this high-level cognitive ability are unclear. We hypothesized that possible mechanisms include improvements in the encoding, maintenance, and/or integration of relations among mental representations - i.e., relational thinking. Here, we developed several eye gaze metrics to pinpoint learning mechanisms that underpin improved reasoning performance. We collected behavioral and eyetracking data from young adults who participated in a Law School Admission Test preparation course involving word-based reasoning problems or reading comprehension. The Reasoning group improved more than the Comprehension group on a composite measure of four visuospatial reasoning assessments. Both groups improved similarly on an eyetracking paradigm involving transitive inference problems, exhibiting faster response times while maintaining high accuracy levels; nevertheless, the Reasoning group exhibited a larger change than the Comprehension group on an ocular metric of relational thinking. Across the full sample, individual differences in response time reductions were associated with increased efficiency of relational thinking. Accounting for changes in visual search and a more specific measure of relational integration improved the prediction accuracy of the model, but changes in these two processes alone did not adequately explain behavioral improvements. These findings provide evidence of transfer of learning across different kinds of reasoning problems after completing a brief but intensive course. More broadly, the high temporal precision and rich derivable parameters of eyetracking make it a powerful approach for probing learning mechanisms. Psychology: Eye gaze reveals improvement in reasoning Preparing for the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) hones reasoning skills. A team led by Silvia Bunge at the University of California at Berkeley in the USA used behavioral and eyetracking methods to test whether, and how, studying for the LSAT would lead to improved reasoning on unrelated tasks. Young adults studying the Logic Games section of the LSAT, as compared with the Reading Comprehension section, showed improved performance on a battery of tests of reasoning. Further, eyetracking revealed a key mechanism underlying learning: increased efficiency in the ability to examine key pieces of information in a problem to arrive at a logical conclusion. Measuring eye gaze patterns during task performance can be used to track learning over time and to gain insights regarding the underlying processes of change.

Phenotypic plasticity drives a depth gradient in male conspicuousness in threespine stickleback, <i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Local adaptation; microclines; nuptial color; phenotypic plasticity; sensory drive	SEXUAL SELECTION; MATE CHOICE; 3-SPINED STICKLEBACK; VISUAL PIGMENTS; OIL DROPLETS; NATURAL-SELECTION; COLOR PATTERNS; FEMALE CHOICE; SENSORY DRIVE; SURFPERCH EMBIOTOCIDAE	Signal evolution is thought to depend on both a signal's detectability or conspicuousness (signal design) as well as any extractable information it may convey to a potential receiver (signal content). While theoretical and empirical work in sexual selection has largely focused on signal content, there has been a steady accrual of evidence that signal design is also important for trait evolution. Despite this, relatively little attention has been paid to spatial variation in the conspicuousness of a given signal, especially over small spatial scales (relative to an organism's dispersal distance). Here, we show that visual signals of male threespine stickleback vary in conspicuousness, depending on a male's nest depth within a given lake. Deeper nesting males were typically more chromatically conspicuous than shallow nesting males. This trend is partly because all male stickleback are more conspicuous in deep optical environments. However, deep males are even more conspicuous than environmentally driven null expectations, while shallow males tend to be disproportionally cryptic. Experimental manipulation of male nesting depth induced plastic changes in nuptial color that replicated the natural gradients in conspicuousness. We discuss a number of potential mechanisms that could produce depth gradients in conspicuousness in male stickleback, including concomitant depth gradients in diet, predation pressure, male/female density, female preference, and opportunity for sexual selection.

This paper describes and summarizes the five key questions of human performance modeling: 1) Why we build models of human performance; 2) What the expectations of a good human performance model are; 3) What the procedures and requirements in building and verifying a human performance model are; 4) How we integrate a human performance model with system design; and 5) What the possible future directions of human performance modeling research are. Recent and classic HPM findings are addressed in the five questions to provide new thinking in HPM's motivations, expectations, procedures, system integration and future directions.

J	Wang, XY; Wang, J				Wang, Xueyu; Wang, Jian			Implementing an interactive approach in translator education	INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Translator education; interactive approach; modes; implementation; assessment		The newborn MTI (Master of Translation and Interpreting) program in China is a new platform that induces abundant opportunities for translator training, meanwhile poses methodological and professional challenges. Thus, an interactive teaching and learning model is proposed.(1) This study is devoted to finding out whether the interactive model improves the MTI students' satisfaction and the learning outcomes of a compulsory course in the MTI program. This model consists of three modes which are implemented in three respective stages of lesson design, by applying a task-based, workshop-based and project-based methodology, and/or a seminar method. The assessment of the learning outcomes is conducted based on the exam results and other information gathered from a teacher performance appraisal system and a survey completed by the MTI students. This study shows that the interactive model creates an environment that can significantly foster instructor-student and student-student interaction, enhance students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and consequently promote the translation competence and translator competence of the MTI students as potential professional translators. Hopefully, this approach will facilitate the teaching of other courses within the curriculum of MTI programs and shed light on other training programs as well.

Nurses have to decide on care for clients with multiple health problems. Technological innovations promise solutions for support of self-management of older people. We do not know, however, how and when nurses assess eHealth. A qualitative study design was used, in which 43 homecare nurses participated in focus groups and think aloud interviews. The study shows that nurses believe a trusting relationship necessary in order to suggest eHealth interventions. Nurses say they need home visits for the assessment of eHealth. Nurses also have some strong opinions on eHealth, like the notion that eHealth isn't a fitting option for frail older people. It becomes clear that nurses need to see eHealth interventions fit for clients in a person-centred way and in close connection to health problems they've prioritised in order to assess it. Implications for practice and further research are to focus on how nurses can be convinced to assess and use eHealth in a person-centred way and how to discuss this with their clients. Next to that training and a tool that provides up to date information linked to frequently seen health problems are recommended.

Engineering such molecular computing systems is a major challenge for synthetic biology and related fields. The chemical reaction network (CRN) model idealizes chemical interactions, allowing rigorous reasoning about the computational power of chemical kinetics. Here we focus on function computation with CRNs, where we think of the initial concentrations of some species as the input and the equilibrium concentration of another species as the output. Specifically, we are concerned with CRNs that are rate-independent (the computation must be correct independent of the reaction rate law) and composable (f circle g can be computed by concatenating the CRNs computing f and g). Rate independence and composability are important engineering desiderata, permitting implementations that violate mass-action kinetics, or even "well-mixedness", and allowing the systematic construction of complex computation via modular design. We show that to construct composable rate-independent CRNs, it is necessary and sufficient to ensure that the output species of a module is not a reactant in any reaction within the module. We then exactly characterize the functions computable by such CRNs as superadditive, positive-continuous, and piecewise rational linear. Thus composability severely limits rate-independent computation unless more sophisticated input/output encodings are used.

Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes a new methodological framework that allows country- and firm-level effects to be combined. The authors hand collected information from 175 studies and around 1,100 estimates in Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa from 1940 to 2008. Findings The two main findings indicate that macro effects are much larger than enterprise-level ones, by a factor of at least six and the benefits from foreign direct investment (FDI) into emerging economies are substantially less conditional than commonly thought. Originality/value The empirical literature has not reached a conclusion as to whether FDI yields spillovers when the host economies are emerging. Instead, the results are often viewed as conditional. For macro studies, this means that the existence and scale of spillover effects are contingent on the levels of institutional, financial or human capital development attained by the host economies. For enterprise-level studies, conditionality relates to the type of inter-firm linkages, namely, forwards, backwards or horizontal.

Major milestones in chemistry can be related directly to improvements in balance design, precision, and accuracy. In a similar manner, the past three decades have seen dramatic improvements in spectrometers. The development of these instruments has greatly improved our understanding of polymer structure and properties. We discuss our current research in multidimensional spectrometry, imaging, and mapping. How does one determine the structure of molecules? One approach is the infrared and Raman study of the polymer vibrations to understand the structure and interactions so successfully applied by our awardee, Professor Jack Koenig. Historically, in the 1950s, the Perkin-Elmer Corp. introduced an infrared microscope for a limited number of applications. This development stimulated the thought of seeking more information about the microstructure. Today, we have a number of two-dimensional detectors for infrared and Raman studies. However, the expense of this instrumentation tends to limit its utilization. In this article, a new inexpensive approach for mapping molecular structure in polymeric materials is discussed. This new approach includes the combination of interferometers and Hadamard transform techniques to perform multidimensional spectrometry and mapping. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Despite widespread applications of zirconium, the structure and dynamics of the tetramer in aqueous solution are not well understood. We conducted a combination of ab initio molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical studies in the gas phase and aqueous solution and related our results to the available experimental data to provide atom-level information on the behavior of this species in aqueous solution. (-)Our simulations indicate that the tetramer structure is stable on the picosecond time scale in an aqueous environment and that it is of a planar form, comprising eight-coordinated Zr4+ ions with an antiprism/ irregular dodecahedron ligand arrangement. In combination with our studies of Zr4+ dimer and trimer clusters, our results provide detailed geometrical information on structural motifs for building zirconium polymers and suggest a possible polymerization path.

However, when they present evidence to support these claims, it is usually based on single case studies of intervention. There have been very few attempts at evaluating across methods and across interventions undertaken by different people. This is because, in any local intervention, contextual factors, the skills of the researcher and the purposes being pursued by stakeholders affect the perceived success or failure of a method. The use of standard criteria for comparing methods is therefore made problematic by the need to consider what is unique in each intervention. So, is it possible to develop a single evaluation approach that can support both locally meaningful evaluations and longer-term comparisons between methods? This paper outlines a methodological framework for the evaluation of systemic problem structuring methods that seeks to do just this. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Triggers for an episode of sudden onset low back pain: study protocol	BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS			English	Article								Background: Most research on risk factors for low back pain has focused on long term exposures rather than factors immediately preceding the onset of low back pain. The aim of this study is to quantify the transient increase in risk of a sudden episode of low back pain associated with acute exposure to a range of common physical and psychological factors. Methods/design: This study uses a case-crossover design. One thousand adults with a sudden onset of low back pain presenting to primary care clinicians will be recruited. Basic demographic and clinical information including exposure to putative triggers will be collected using a questionnaire. These triggers include exposure to hazardous manual tasks, physical activity, a slip/trip or fall, consumption of alcohol, sexual activity, being distracted, and being fatigued or tired. Exposures in the case window (0-2 hours from the time when participants first notice their back pain) will be compared to exposures in two control time-windows (one 24-26 hours and another 48-50 hours before the case window). Discussion: The completion of this study will provide the first-research based estimates of the increase in risk of a sudden episode of acute low back pain associated with transient exposure to a range of common factors thought to trigger low back pain.

J	De Prisco, R; Guarino, A; Malandrino, D; Zaccagnino, R				De Prisco, Roberto; Guarino, Alfonso; Malandrino, Delfina; Zaccagnino, Rocco			Induced Emotion-Based Music Recommendation through Reinforcement Learning	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						affective computing; musical emotion; emotional state; reinforcement learning; user evaluation	SYSTEM; RECOGNITION; MOTIVATION; NETWORKS; MODEL; GAME; GO	Music is widely used for mood and emotion regulation in our daily life. As a result, many research works on music information retrieval and affective human-computer interaction have been proposed to model the relationships between emotion and music. However, most of these works focus on applications in a context-sensitive recommendation that considers the listener's emotional state, but few results have been obtained in studying systems for inducing future emotional states. This paper proposes Moodify, a novel music recommendation system based on reinforcement learning (RL) capable of inducing emotions in the user to support the interaction process in several usage scenarios (e.g., games, movies, smart spaces). Given a target emotional state, and starting from the assumption that an emotional state is entirely determined by a sequence of recently played music tracks, the proposed RL method is designed to learn how to select the list of music pieces that better "match" the target emotional state. Differently from previous works in the literature, the system is conceived to induce an emotional state starting from a current emotion instead of capturing the current emotion and suggesting certain songs that are thought to be suitable for that mood. We have deployed Moodify as a prototype web application, named MoodifyWeb. Finally, we enrolled 40 people to experiment MoodifyWeb, employing one million music playlists from the Spotify platform. This preliminary evaluation study aimed to analyze MoodifyWeb's effectiveness and overall user satisfaction. The results showed a highly rated user satisfaction, system responsiveness, and appropriateness of the recommendation (up to 4.30, 4.45, and 4.75 on a 5-point Likert, respectively) and that such recommendations were better than they thought before using MoodifyWeb (6.45 on a 7-point Likert).

Teaching bioengineering using a blended online teaching and learning strategy: a new pedagogy for adapting classrooms in developing countries	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Pedagogy; Bioengineering; Collaborate; Teach; Learn; Higher Education; Blended learning; Engineering Education	FLIPPED CLASSROOM; COGNITIVE LOAD; EDUCATION; CONCEPTIONS; PERFORMANCE; INSTRUCTION; STUDENTS; SCIENCE	Research and academia have been recently affected by the Coronavirus (COVID-19), and physical classrooms and laboratory experiments have been affected significantly due to the recent laboratory closures. This has led to innovative approaches to curb this problem. To address these difficulties in teaching bioengineering related courses that is of significant interest to students of the Faculty of Engineering in Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria, and of course, useful for engineering-based higher education institutions (HEI), a transitional pedagogy: Communicate, Active, Collaborate, Problem-based Solving, Learning and Assessment (CACPLA), which encompasses blended learning, was developed as a new teaching and learning strategy. In this study, we show that this new strategy can initiate a steady transition from physical classrooms to full online instruction for some subjects in engineering. This method has been trialled as an exercise for a module as part of an envisioned biomedical engineering degree programme which can be integrated with local industries and research institutions in sub-Saharan Africa. The teaching materials and environment were carefully designed and 253 students of third and final year classes participated as the experimental group. Also, the effect of critical thinking, pre-lecture, and post lecture on the overall performance of the students was assessed. Two questionnaires were designed for data collection, (a) for technical questions, (b) for receptiveness. The result of a student survey suggests favourable reception of the teaching methodology, which aided their understanding of the general bioengineering concept as applied to the materials chemistry and mechanical measurements context. It was noticed that 80% of the students indicated that the blended learning method was sufficient in achieving the learning outcomes of the study. The method is envisioned as a useful and sustainable complement to traditional teaching pedagogies and workshops due to the convenience and relatively high accessibility to Zoom and Google Meet Apps which can be readily employed without incurring significant costs.

The methods of optical microscopy, electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, and nuclear magnetic resonance increasingly are being combined in hybrid method approaches to achieve an integrated view of macromolecular complexes that span from cellular context to atomic detail. A particularly important application of these hybrid method approaches is the structural analysis of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) proteins with their cellular binding partners. High resolution structure determination of essential HIV - host cell protein complexes and correlative analysis of these complexes in the live cell can serve as critical guides in the design of a broad, new class of therapeutics that function by disrupting such complexes. Here, with the hope of stimulating some discussion, we will briefly review some of the literature in the context of what could be done to further apply structural methods to HIV research. We have chosen to focus our attention on certain aspects of the HIV replication cycle where we think that structural information would contribute substantially to the development of new therapeutic and vaccine targets for HIV.

In order to clarify the essential structure-activity relationship and the detailed binding modes of beta(3)-AR agonists as well as to identify new lead compounds activating beta(3)-AR, ligand-based and receptor-based methods were applied. The pharmacophoremodels were developed based on 144 beta(3)-AR agonists. Meanwhile, the homology model of the beta(3)-AR was built based on the crystal structure of beta(2)-AR. The pharmacophore model and the homology model mapped with each other very well, and some important information was obtained from the docking result. For example, agonists formed similar hydrogen-bonding interactions with residues Asp117, Arg315, and Asn332, pi-pi stacking interaction with residues Phe308, and hydrophobic interactions with residues Val118, Val121, Ala197, Phe198, Ala199, Phe309, and Phe328 of beta(3)-AR. And the major difference about binding mode from the crystal structures of beta(1)- and beta(2)-ARs is the hydrogen-bonding interaction with the residue Arg315, which corresponds to the residue Asn313 of beta(1)-AR and the residue His296 of beta(2)-AR, respectively. Our findings may be crucial for the design and development of novel selective and potent beta(3)-AR agonists.

The word "computer" now signifies a ubiquitous electronic device, rather than a human occupation. Yet evidently humans, large assemblies of molecules, can compute, and it has been a thrilling challenge to develop smaller, simpler, synthetic assemblies of molecules that can do useful computation. When we say that molecules compute, what we usually mean is that such molecules respond to certain inputs, for example, the presence or absence of other molecules, in a precisely defined but potentially complex fashion. The simplest way for a chemist to think about computing molecules is as sensors that can integrate the presence or absence of multiple analytes into a change in a single reporting property. Here we review several forms of molecular computing developed in our laboratories. When we began our work, combinatorial approaches to using DNA for computing were used to search for solutions to constraint satisfaction problems. We chose to work instead on logic circuits, building bottom-up from units based on catalytic nucleic acids, focusing on DNA secondary structures in the design of individual circuit elements, and reserving the combinatorial opportunities of DNA for the representation of multiple signals propagating in a large circuit. Such circuit design directly corresponds to the intuition about sensors transforming the detection of analytes into reporting properties. While this approach was unusual at the time, it has been adopted since by other groups working on biomolecular computing with different nucleic acid chemistries. We created logic gates by modularly combining deoxyribozymes (DNA-based enzymes cleaving or combining other oligonucleotides), in the role of reporting elements, with stem loops as input detection elements. For instance, a deoxyribozyme that normally exhibits an oligonucleotide substrate recognition region is modified such that a stem loop closes onto the substrate recognition region, making it unavailable for the substrate and thus rendering the deoxyribozyme inactive. But a conformational change can then be induced by an input oligonucleotide, complementary to the loop, to open the stem, allow the substrate to bind, and allow its cleavage to proceed, which is eventually reported via fluorescence. In this Account, several designs of this form are reviewed, along with their application in the construction of large circuits that exhibited complex logical and temporal relationships between the inputs and the outputs. Intelligent (in the sense of being capable of nontrivial information processing) theranostic (therapy + diagnostic) applications have always been the ultimate motivation for developing computing (i.e., decision-making) circuits, and we review our experiments with logic-gate elements bound to cell surfaces that evaluate the proximal presence of multiple markers on lymphocytes.

See vol. 143, pg. 481, 2023)	YAKUGAKU ZASSHI-JOURNAL OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN			Japanese	Review; Withdrawn Publication						photoimmunotherapy; photochemistry; fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; triplet state		Photoimmunotherapy (PIT) is a new cancer therapy that uses near-infrared (NIR) light and a conjugate of an antibody and a photosensitizer (IR700). Since both NIR light and the conjugate are not toxic for human, PIT has attracted attention as a promising cancer therapy with less side eSects. However, there is no photosensitizer for PIT other than IR700. To improve the therapeutic eSect, more light-sensitive dye is needed. To this end, we have studied the cytotoxic mechanism of PIT, showing that the hydrophilic axial ligand cleavage of IR700 by NIR light irradiation is important for the cytotoxicity. Herein, I focused on the triplet state (T-1) of IR700 because the light-induced axial ligand cleavage reaction is thought to occur via the T-1. First, the quantum yield of intersystem crossing, which is the transition efficiency from the excited singlet state (S-1) to T-1, was determined by analysis of the T-1 kinetics using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Also, I examined whether the cytotoxicity of IR700 can be changed in the presence of a triplet quencher. The findings obtained here will be important information for the design of a new photosensitizer for PIT in the future.

Developing a Simplified Consent Form for Biobanking	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INFORMED-CONSENT; CLINICAL-TRIALS; BIOREPOSITORIES; ACT	Background: Consent forms have lengthened over time and become harder for participants to understand. We sought to demonstrate the feasibility of creating a simplified consent form for biobanking that comprises the minimum information necessary to meet ethical and regulatory requirements. We then gathered preliminary data concerning its content from hypothetical biobank participants. Methodology/Principal Findings: We followed basic principles of plain-language writing and incorporated into a 2-page form (not including the signature page) those elements of information required by federal regulations and recommended by best practice guidelines for biobanking. We then recruited diabetes patients from community-based practices and randomized half (n = 56) to read the 2-page form, first on paper and then a second time on a tablet computer. Participants were encouraged to use "More information'' buttons on the electronic version whenever they had questions or desired further information. These buttons led to a series of "Frequently Asked Questions'' (FAQs) that contained additional detailed information. Participants were asked to identify specific sentences in the FAQs they thought would be important if they were considering taking part in a biorepository. On average, participants identified 7 FAQ sentences as important (mean 6.6, SD 14.7, range: 0-71). No one sentence was highlighted by a majority of participants; further, 34 (60.7%) participants did not highlight any FAQ sentences. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings suggest that our 2-page form contains the information that most prospective participants identify as important. Combining simplified forms with supplemental material for those participants who desire more information could help minimize consent form length and complexity, allowing the most substantively material information to be better highlighted and enabling potential participants to read the form and ask questions more effectively.

The methods are based on total reflection of X-rays from the surface and include X-ray reflectivity, grazing-incidence X-ray scattering and X-ray standing waves. Their potential is exemplified by the investigations of various organic macromolecular systems that exhibit the properties of semiconductors and are thought to be promising as thin-film transistors, light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic cells. It is shown that combination of the title methods enable high-precision investigations of the structure of thin-film materials and structure formation in them, i.e., it is possible to obtain information necessary for improvement of the operating efficiency of elements of organic electronic devices.

It has found application in areas where corrosion/abrasion and aqueous corrosion problems arise. Widespread use of 3CR12 in these environments, since its introduction in 1979, has resulted in a large quantity of data on its performance. Many of the early recommendations for use in non-critical applications were based upon intuition and case by case experimental testing. With time this spawned a number of generic corrosion testing programmes. This resulted in the production of interesting, but often difficult to interpret, results concerning the performance of 3CR12. As market pressure for case history data grew a programme was developed to fulfil this need. This paper highlights the process followed from the release of 3CR12 into the market place to the production of predictive, usable data on its performance in aqueous environments. The disadvantages of environment-specific testing on a utility product such as this are highlighted and the growth in general, but difficult to interpret, data outlined. Techniques such as pitting scans, ZRA studies and experimental E-pH diagrams were employed to produce a number of predictive models. The integration and accuracy of these models was then tested against known case histories and this matched the 'experience' and 'feel' of various materials consultants. Bringing all these facets together has enabled a decison-based guide to be produced which takes the potential user step by step through the thought processes and information required for a selection decision. Clearly, a number of generalisations have to be made in such an approach but it is argued that provided these are highlighted, and examples given of how to overcome them, their use is justified by the advantages of having an easy to read material selection guide. A summary of the guide itself is given and comments on how it will be improved, as more information is gathered, discussed. The structure of the guide is such that important criteria such as temperature, pH, ionic species concentrations, Langelier Index, suspended solids and others are discussed in conjunction with design considerations to give a holistic approach to material selection. It is argued that technology and information transfer need to be improved to enable material users and specifiers to recommend appropriate materials, not just 3CR12, for various applications.

J	Wang, X; Chen, L; Wang, X				Wang, Xu; Chen, Ling; Wang, Xin			Renewed Epicentral Distribution of Low Frequency Marsquakes by Varying-Parameter Polarization Analysis of InSight Data	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						marsquake; relocation; back-azimuth; polarization analysis; InSight	SINGLE-STATION; IMPACT CRATERS; MARS; SEISMICITY; THICKNESS; EVOLUTION; LOCATION; PLANITIA; EARTH	Accurate information about marsquake locations is crucial for understanding the tectonic activity, subsurface structures, and dynamics of Mars. We designed a varying-parameter scheme for polarization analysis to determine the back-azimuths of marsquakes. For two Martian meteorite impact events with ground-truth locations known from orbital images, our scheme yields back-azimuths that are similar to 5 degrees and similar to 14 degrees closer to the true values than those reported previously, demonstrating our method's advantages in constraining back-azimuths. We applied this method to determine the back-azimuths of 44 Low Frequency marsquakes and 39 were reliably relocated. Nearly half of these marsquakes occur in Cerberus Fossae, while the rest are broadly distributed, including along the dichotomy boundary and within the northern lowlands and southern highlands. Although further studies are required to understand the mechanisms of these marsquakes, the widespread seismicity implies that present-day Mars, especially the ancient southern highlands, is more tectonically active than previously thought. Plain Language Summary Identifying seismic activity on Mars is crucial for advancing our understanding of the planet's present-day properties and tectonic processes. From February 2019 to December 2022, the InSight seismograph captured nearly one hundred Low Frequency marsquakes. As these marsquakes have similar ground vibration characteristics to tectonic earthquakes, they are important to understand tectonic-related activities on Mars. However, there is only a single seismograph on Mars, and some of the data for Low Frequency marsquakes are noisy, making it challenging to precisely determine their locations. To improve the accuracy of marsquake locations, we devised a scheme using sliding time and frequency windows to effectively constrain the orientation of marsquakes relative to the seismograph. With this method, we successfully relocated 39 Low Frequency marsquakes. Our new findings indicate that a significant portion, approximately half, of these marsquakes are concentrated in the Cerberus Fossae region, while the remaining events are distributed across various tectonic units. Interestingly, we have also identified marsquakes within the ancient southern highlands, an area that has previously had limited reports of seismic activity. Although the origin of marsquakes may differ from region to region, the widespread distribution of marsquakes suggests that Mars is more tectonically active than previously thought.

Although various factors may give a chance to a false recollection of information that may not occur. These false memories are formed based on various neuro-cognitive processes the underlying mechanism still needs to be well understood. Considering the extended searching when no memory trace is found, we hypothesized that the self-similarities in the brain activations must be higher during false memory recalls. Therefore, a language-free task based on autobiographical brand images was designed using the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. The task was then tested on 24 healthy participants while the brain activities during the test were recorded using a 32-channel EEG system. Subsequently, the self-similarities in the brain activity pattern were estimated by taking the fractal dimension (FD) of the cleaned EEG data. Statistical analysis showed a significant increase in complexity during false memory recalls as compared to true memory recalls prominent in the frontal regions. Interestingly, the EEG findings were consistent in both genders and significantly correlated with subjects' accuracy rates and reaction times (RTs) to recall.

J	Zhang, WJ; Zhu, S; Liu, LF; Bai, LF; Han, J; Guo, EL				Zhang, Wenjun; Zhu, Shuo; Liu, Lingfeng; Bai, Lianfa; Han, Jing; Guo, Enlai			High-throughput imaging through dynamic scattering media based on speckle de-blurring	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							DECORRELATION TIME; LIGHT; TRANSMISSION; PROPAGATION; LAYERS; WAVES	Effectively imaging through dynamic scattering media is of great importance and challenge. Some imaging methods based on physical or learning models have been designed for object reconstruction. However, with an increase in exposure time or more drastic changes in the scattering medium, the speckle pattern superimposed during camera integration time undergoes more significant changes, resulting in a modification of the collected speckle structure and increased blurring, which brings significant challenges to the reconstruction. Here, the clearer structural information of blurred speckles is unearthed with a presented speckle de-blurring algorithm, and a high-throughput imaging method through rapidly changing scattering media is proposed for reconstruction under long exposure. For the problem of varying blur degrees in different regions of the speckle, a block-based method is proposed to divide the speckle into distinct sub-speckles, which can realize the reconstruction of hidden objects. The imaging of hidden objects with different complexity through dynamic scattering media is demonstrated, and the reconstruction results are improved significantly for speckles with different blur degrees, which verifies the effectiveness of the method. This method is a high-throughput approach that enables non-invasive imaging solely through the collection of a single speckle. It directly operates on blurred speckles, making it suitable for traditional speckle-correlation methods and deep learning (DL) methods. This provides a new way of thinking about solving practical scattering imaging challenges.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement	[Zhang, Wenjun; Zhu, Shuo; Liu, Lingfeng; Bai, Lianfa; Han, Jing; Guo, Enlai] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Jiangsu Key Lab Spectral Imaging & Intelligent Sen, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China	Nanjing University of Science & Technology	Guo, EL (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Jiangsu Key Lab Spectral Imaging & Intelligent Sen, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China.	njustgel@njust.edu.cn	Liu, Lingfeng/HZH-3614-2023	Liu, Lingfeng/0009-0004-9587-660X	National Natural Science Foundation of China [61971227, 62031018, 62101255]; Jiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program [BE2022391]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2021M701721, 2022M721620, 2023T160319]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)	Funding.

These fields can be collectively referred to as "global -omics." Increasing efforts have been made over the past 2 decades to identify and modify environmental risk factors among persons who are susceptible to disease because of their genotype and to integrate genetic information and other biological variables with information about individual-level risk factors and group-level or societal factors related to the broader residential, behavioral, or cultural context. In genome-wide association studies, only a small proportion of heritability is explained by genetic variants identified to date, which has prompted researchers in bioinformatics and biostatistics to take into account nonlinear relationships due to gene-environment or gene-gene interactions. The exposome, which is dynamic and variable, consists of all of the internal and external exposures an individual incurs over a lifetime. Both the epigenome and exposome change with age. The prenatal and perinatal periods are thought to be important times for epigenetic marking. Once the human epigenome has been fully mapped, identification of the effects of all deleterious environmental exposures according to duration of exposure and time period will be a complex undertaking, requiring collaborative epidemiologic studies.

With the emergence of prosumers as smart agents capable of both producing and consuming energy, the modern electricity markets should be prosumer-centric. In the novel prosumer-centric approach, the prosumers can trade energy with each other in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion. In these new markets, the retailers can be thought of as profit-based companies that either generate electrical energy themselves or purchase it at variable prices from the wholesale market or other prosumers in the local market. The retailers then sell the generated or purchased energy to the local consumers, wholesale markets, or other prosumers. Smart grid technology allows the prosumers (the end-users) to purchase their needed power from any producer in the grid and sell their excess energy to any consumer or retailer. This article designs a competitive market consisting of prosumers and retailers such that all prosumers (as buyers and sellers) and retailers conduct peer-to-peer energy trading. A novel decentralized approach called primal-dual sub-gradient algorithm (PDSGA) is used to clear the designed market without third-party involvement or disclosure of players' private information. The feasibility of the proposed market and the effectiveness of the novel decentralized scheme for market-clearing are demonstrated through numerical implementation.

J	Luan, TT; Sun, MX; Xia, GQ; Chen, DD				Luan, Tiantian; Sun, Mingxiao; Xia, Guoqing; Chen, Daidai			Evaluation for Sortie Generation Capacity of the Carrier Aircraft Based on the Variable Structure RBF Neural Network with the Fast Learning Rate	COMPLEXITY			English	Article							ALGORITHM; HYBRID; OPTIMIZATION	The neural network has the advantages of self-learning, self-adaptation, and fault tolerance. It can establish a qualitative and quantitative evaluation model which is closer to human thought patterns. However, the structure and the convergence rate of the radial basis function (RBF) neural network need to be improved. This paper proposes a new variable structure radial basis function (VS-RBF) with a fast learning rate, in order to solve the problem of structural optimization design and parameter learning algorithm for the radial basis function neural network. The number of neurons in the hidden layer is adjusted by calculating the output information of neurons in the hidden layer and the multi-information between neurons in the hidden layer and output layer. This method effectively solves the problem that the RBF neural network structure is too large or too small. The convergence rate of the RBF neural network is improved by using the robust regression algorithm and the fast learning rate algorithm. At the same time, the convergence analysis of the VS-RBF neural network is given to ensure the stability of the RBF neural network. Compared with other self-organizing RBF neural networks (self-organizing RBF (SORBF) and rough RBF neural networks (RS-RBF)), VS-RBF has a more compact structure, faster dynamic response speed, and better generalization ability. The simulations of approximating a typical nonlinear function, identifying UCI datasets, and evaluating sortie generation capacity of an carrier aircraft show the effectiveness of VS-RBF.

J	Correa, LA; Mehboudi, M				Correa, Luis A.; Mehboudi, Mohammad			Testing a Quantum Heat Pump with a Two-Level Spin	ENTROPY			English	Article						thermodynamics; open quantum systems; thermal engineering	THERMODYNAMICS; EQUIVALENT; EFFICIENCY; ENGINES; POWER	Once in its non-equilibrium steady state, a nanoscale system coupled to several heat baths may be thought of as a "quantum heat pump". Depending on the direction of its stationary heat flows, it may function as, e.g., a refrigerator or a heat transformer. These continuous heat devices can be arbitrarily complex multipartite systems, and yet, their working principle is always the same: they are made up of several elementary three-level stages operating in parallel. As a result, it is possible to devise external "black-box" testing strategies to learn about their functionality and performance regardless of any internal details. In particular, one such heat pump can be tested by coupling a two-level spin to one of its "contact transitions". The steady state of this external probe contains information about the presence of heat leaks and internal dissipation in the device and, also, about the direction of its steady-state heat currents. Provided that the irreversibility of the heat pump is low, one can further estimate its coefficient of performance. These techniques may find applications in the emerging field of quantum thermal engineering, as they facilitate the diagnosis and design optimization of complex thermodynamic cycles.

J	Wang, Y; Wang, KL; He, JH; Zhang, LF				Wang, Yang; Wang, Kelin; He, Jiangheng; Zhang, Lifei			On unusual conditions for the exhumation of subducted oceanic crustal rocks: How to make rocks hotter than models	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						subduction zone; thermal structure; metamorphic rocks; numerical modeling; exhumation; subduction cessation	HIGH-PRESSURE ROCKS; SLAB; ECLOGITES; ZONES; WARM; LONG; FLOW; ARC; METAMORPHISM; BLUESCHISTS	The thermal structure of subduction zones controls many important processes such as metamorphic devolatilization, arc magmatism, and seismicity. However, the thermal state of subducted oceanic slab predicted by subduction zone thermal models down to & SIM;80 km depth is systematically cooler than inferred from exhumed metamorphic slab rocks, raising questions about the current understanding of subduction dynamics portrayed by these models. Upon synthesizing previous petrological studies and estimating slab ages of ancient subduction zones from metamorphic terranes, we think that exhumation of subducted oceanic metamorphic rocks is extremely rare and likely requires unusual processes that are not an integral component of normal subduction dynamics. We construct simple numerical scenarios to illustrate how the thermal regime under some unusual conditions at the beginning and ending stages of a subduction margin may deviate from the normal subduction process. At the beginning stage of subduction, a shallow maximum decoupling depth (MDD) between the slab and mantle wedge enables viscous mantle wedge flow to reach a shallow depth, bringing heat to make slab rocks warmer than in a mature subduction zone. At the ending stage of subduction, if subduction cessation is in the form of slab stalling and if the stalled slab is not immediately exhumed, the slab rocks can be warmed up by the heat from the warm mantle wedge and underlying asthenosphere. In either situation, the slab rocks can be much warmer than normal before they are exhumed by other dynamic processes. Observed exhumed rocks are not expected to represent the normal subduction process and should not be directly compared with thermal models that are designed for the normal process. To extract important information about general geodynamic processes from these rocks, we must first understand the processes these rocks went through.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Different prevention programmes have been developed to help and support children. Previous studies have focused on the child or the group leader's experience with divorce groups, but studies describing parent's experience are missing. The aim of this study was to explore parents' experiences of their child's participation in divorce groups.Methods: An inductive, qualitative and descriptive design was applied with philosophical orientation in naturalistic inquiry based on the outlines of a phenomenological perspective. Two fathers and three mothers from two different counties in Norway participated whereof four of them were interviewed twice. Systematic text condensation was used for the analysis.Results: Three themes emerged from the analysis: encouraging the child, missing communication and challenging situations. Parents described how they encouraged the child to attend divorce groups and hoped they would gain a deeper understanding of their parents' divorce and their own feelings. Missing communication relates to lack of information about the groups from the school, the group leader and from the child. Missing information was found to be a challenge for the parents and made them think that the divorce group was beneficial for the child but maybe not always for the family. Parents described challenging situations due to the divorce, and they struggled to understand their child and their own behaviour.Conclusions: The opportunity for the child to talk to other children in the same situation in divorce groups was positive for the parents. To be beneficial for both children and their parents, structured information and cooperation among the school, the child and both parents are important. The knowledge from this study can support the development and use of intervention programmes in the future.

A single point mutation at the distal site of the endogenous tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) enables this clinical target protein to tightly bind and inhibit membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) by increasing only the association constant. The high-resolution X-ray structure of this complex determined at 2 A could not explain the mechanism of enhanced binding and pointed to a role for protein conformational dynamics. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the high-affinity TIMP-1 mutants exhibit significantly reduced binding interface flexibility and more stable hydrogen bond networks. This was accompanied by a redistribution of the ensemble of substrates to favorable binding conformations that fit the enzyme catalytic site. Apparently, the decrease in backbone flexibility led to a lower entropy cost upon formation of the complex. This work quantifies the effect of a single point mutation on the protein conformational dynamics and function of TIMP-1. Here we argue that controlling the intrinsic protein dynamics of M MP endogenous inhibitors may be utilized for rationalizing the design of selective novel protein inhibitors for this class of enzymes.

Thus, it is thought to be a prominent therapeutic target, and its selective inhibitors have a huge market potential. Recently, herbal PAK1 inhibitors have gained immense interest over synthetic ones mainly due to their non-toxic effects. Till date, many herbal compounds have been suggested to inhibit PAK1, but their information on selectivity, bioavailability, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties, and molecular interactions with PAK1 has not been explored. Hence, this study was designed with computational approaches to explore and identify the best herbal PAK1-blockers showing good ADMET properties, druggable features and binding affinity with PAK1. Herbal inhibitors reported here were initially filtered with Lipinski's rule of five (RO5). Then, molecular docking between these inhibitors and PAK1 catalytic sites was performed using AutoDock Vina and GOLD suite to determine the binding affinity and interactions. Finally, 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on three top-ranked inhibitors including cucurbitacin I (C-I), nymphaeol A (NA), and staurosporine (SPN) were carried out. The binding free energies and interactions revealed that NA can strongly bind with the PAK1 catalytic cleft. PASS prediction and ADMET profiling supported that NA is appeared to be a more selective and safer inhibitor than C-I and SPN. These results conform to the previous experimental evidences, and therefore, NA from Okinawa propolis could be a promising inhibitor for treating PAK1-dependent illnesses.

Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is commonly used for determination of average drug concentrations; however, complete loss of spatial information in the target tissue occurs. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has been recently applied as an innovative tool for detection of molecular distribution of pharmacological agents in heterogeneous targets. This study examined the intra-brain transitivity of alectinib, a novel anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor, using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-MSI and LC-MS/MS techniques. We first analyzed the pharmacokinetic profiles in FVB mice and then examined the effect of the multidrug resistance protein-1 (MDR1) using Mdr1a/b knockout mice including quantitative distribution of alectinib in the brain. While no differences were observed between the mice for the plasma alectinib concentrations, diffuse alectinib distributions were found in the brain of the Mdr1a/b knockout versus FVB mice. These results indicate the potential for using quantitative MSI for clarifying drug distribution in the brain on a microscopic level, in addition to suggesting a possible use in designing studies for anticancer drug development and translational research.

Advance care planning education in pulmonary rehabilitation: A qualitative study exploring participant perspectives	PALLIATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						Advance care planning; lung diseases; patient education as topic; exercise; qualitative research	OF-LIFE CARE; LUNG-CANCER; PALLIATIVE CARE; DIRECTIVE EDUCATION; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; SEVERE COPD; DISEASE; END; COMMUNICATION; OUTPATIENTS	Background: Advance care planning is considered to have an important role in the management of people with chronic lung disease; however, uptake in clinical practice remains limited. Participant acceptance of the inclusion of an advance care planning information session in pulmonary rehabilitation and maintenance programmes could support a practical solution. Aim: To evaluate the introduction of a structured group advance care planning information session from the perspective of participants in pulmonary rehabilitation and maintenance programmes. Design: Prospective qualitative study with semi-structured interview transcripts analysed using iterative thematic analysis. Setting/participants: Participants in pulmonary rehabilitation and maintenance programmes at a tertiary metropolitan hospital and two affiliated community sites. Results: Sixty-seven participants with a range of chronic lung diseases were interviewed with ages ranging from 39 to 88 years, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) ranging from 18% to 130% predicted and 6-min walk distance ranging from 105 to 619 m. Sixteen participants (24%) had previously heard of advance care planning. Major themes were that participants valued the advance care planning information and thought pulmonary rehabilitation was an appropriate setting. The group education format was well accepted and perceived to have advantages over individual sessions. Participants were happy to receive the information from a non-medical facilitator. Non-attendees had usually missed the session for reasons unrelated to content. A small number of participants felt advance care planning was not appropriate for them, but all recognised its value for other participants. Conclusions: Participants in our pulmonary rehabilitation and maintenance programmes value the opportunity to participate in a structured, group-based advance care planning session. Consideration should be given to broader inclusion of advance care planning education into existing pulmonary rehabilitation and maintenance programmes for people with chronic respiratory disease.

J	Sime, JD				Sime, JD			Crowd psychology and engineering	SAFETY SCIENCE			English	Article							FIRE	This paper argues that a comprehensive approach to crowd safety design, management and risk assessment needs to integrate psychology and engineering frames of reference. Psychology and engineering are characteristically mutually exclusive in their focus on the perspective of crowd members who think and behave (psychology) or on static and dynamic objects (engineering). Engineering places as much emphasis on the physical environment as psychology negates the relationship between the physical environment and people. This paper stresses the need to address the relationship between (A) design and engineering X (B) communications technology X (C) crowd management X (D) crowd behaviour and movement. Theories of crowd psychology are briefly reviewed with particular reference to crowd ingress and egress and misconceptions about 'panic' or irrational behaviour. Assumptions about panic reinforce an emphasis on the control of a crowd, as if a crowd is a homogeneous mass of bodies or 'ballbearings', rather than the management of a crowd as a collection of individuals and social groups who need accurate and timely information if they are to remain safe. Particular emphasis is put on the fact that the time for a crowd to escape from a situation of potential entrapment is a function of T (Time to escape) = t(1) (time to start to move) + t(2) (time to move to and pass through exits), rather than T = t(2). This is illustrated by reference to research of escape behaviour in the Summerland fire and underground station evacuations. The paper concludes by stressing the need to validate computer simulations of crowd movement and escape behaviour against psychological as well as engineering criteria.

Throughout the stroke rehabilitation process, community care is one of the most important elements. Learning to live with and take care of a family member with a stroke is immensely complex and demanding. Without appropriate support, family caregivers are at risk of their own general health decreasing, thus becoming a patient themselves - the second patient in the family. Aim. The aim of this study was to examine aspects of social support available to family caregivers during the first 12-week transitional period following hospital discharge. Design and method. This study adopted a cross-sectional descriptive design. Regression analysis was performed for examining the types of social support received and the general health of family caregivers. Open-ended questions were used to gain a better understanding of situation-specific supports including their availability, utilization and eventual satisfaction. Results. Findings confirm that home care for the stroke survivor is heavy and demanding. Health-related care tasks were the most stressful. Around 40% of the family caregivers reported somatic symptoms. Fewer persons in the social network of the family caregivers had provided support compared with the number of support people that caregivers thought available. Two inadequate types of support were tangible support and information support. Professional advice and feedback in relation to home care skills were particularly lacking. Conclusion. Findings of this study affirmed that stroke care needs exceed the hospital boundary. Professional support to family caregivers is essential so as to sustain home care and protect the caregiver's health. This is particular important during the first 12 weeks transitional period after hospital discharge. Relevance to clinical practice. This study highlighted the implications of social support to nursing practice, especially in predischarge planning and community care. Findings of this study may provide information and data for service planning and community resources co-ordination to support community stroke care.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							APIS-MELLIFERA; ORIENTATION; BEES; MAGNETORECEPTION; COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION; SENSITIVITY; INTENSITY; DIRECTION; PERCEIVE	The honeybee (Apis mellifera) waggle dance, which is performed inside the hive by forager bees, informs hive mates about a potent food source, and recruits them to its location. It consists of a repeated figure-8 pattern: two oppositely directed turns interspersed by a short straight segment, the "waggle run''. The waggle run consists of a single stride emphasized by lateral waggling motions of the abdomen. Directional information pointing to a food source relative to the sun's azimuth is encoded in the angle between the waggle run line and a reference line, which is generally thought to be established by gravity. Yet, there is tantalizing evidence that the local (ambient) geomagnetic field (LGMF) could play a role. We tested the effect of the LGMF on the recruitment success of forager bees by placing observation hives inside large Helmholtz coils, and then either reducing the LGMF to 2% or shifting its apparent declination. Neither of these treatments reduced the number of nest mates that waggle dancing forager bees recruited to a feeding station located 200 m north of the hive. These results indicate that the LGMF does not act as the reference for the alignment of waggle-dancing bees.

J	Wang, YS; Ji, Y				Wang, Yashuang; Ji, Yan			How do they learn: types and characteristics of medical and healthcare student engagement in a simulation-based learning environment	BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Simulation-based learning; Medical and healthcare students; Student engagement; Medical and healthcare education; Learning conducive environment; Facilitator-student learning relationships		Background Student engagement can predict successful learning outcomes and academic development. The expansion of simulation-based medical and healthcare education creates challenges for educators, as they must help students engage in a simulation-based learning environment. This research provides a reference for facilitators of simulation teaching and student learning in medical and health-related majors by providing a deep understanding of student engagement in a simulation-based learning environment. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with ten medical and healthcare students to explore their learning types and characteristics in a simulation-based learning environment. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Results The interviews were thematically analysed to identify three types of student engagement in the simulation-based learning environment: reflective engagement, performance engagement, and interactive engagement. The analysis also identified eight sub-themes: active, persistent, and focused thinking engagement; self-directed-learning thinking engagement with the purpose of problem solving; active "voice" in class; strong emotional experience and disclosure; demonstration of professional leadership; interaction with realistic learning situations; support from teammates; and collegial facilitator-student interaction. Conclusions The student interview and thematic analysis methods can be used to study the richness of student engagement in simulation-based learning environments. This study finds that student engagement in a simulation-based learning environment is different from that in a traditional environment, as it places greater emphasis on performance engagement, which combines both thinking and physical engagement, as well as on interactive engagement as generated through interpersonal interactions. Therefore, we suggest expanding the learning space centring around "inquiry", as it can help strengthen reflective communication and dialogue. It also facilitates imagination, stimulates empathy, and builds an interprofessional learning community. In this way, medical and healthcare students can learn through the two-way transmission of information and cultivate and reshape interpersonal relationships to improve engagement in a simulation-based learning environment.

Emergency management of dental trauma: knowledge of Hong Kong primary and secondary school teachers	HONG KONG MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Emergency treatment; Health education, dental; Tooth avulsion; Tooth fractures; Tooth injuries	OF-THE-LITERATURE; PERMANENT TEETH; LAY KNOWLEDGE; INJURIES; SCHOOLCHILDREN; GUIDELINES; URBAN; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVALENCE; AWARENESS	Objectives To investigate the level of knowledge about emergency management of dental trauma among Hong Kong primary and secondary school teachers. Design Questionnaire survey. Setting A teachers' union that unites 90% of teachers in Hong Kong. Participants Randomly selected primary and secondary school teachers. Results Only 32.8% of respondents correctly stated that a person sustaining dental trauma should go to dentists directly. In all, 73.1% of teachers correctly stated that a dental trauma patient should go for treatment immediately. Only 32.5% knew that a fractured tooth should be put in liquid. Even fewer (23.2%) realised that the displaced tooth should be repositioned back to the original position. Relatively more respondents (74.7%) understood that an avulsed baby tooth should not be put back. Disappointingly, only 16.3% of teachers knew that an avulsed permanent tooth should be replanted. Furthermore, only 29.6% of teachers thought that they were able to distinguish between deciduous teeth and permanent teeth, whilst 20.4% correctly identified at least one of the appropriate mediums: milk, physiological saline or saliva, for storing an avulsed tooth. Teachers who previously received first-aid training with dental content or acquired dental injury information from other sources, scored significantly higher than teachers without such training or acquired information. Conclusion The knowledge on emergency management of dental trauma among primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong is insufficient, particularly on the handling of permanent tooth avulsion and the appropriate storage medium for avulsed teeth. Receipt of first-aid training with dental contents and acquisition of dental injury information from other sources were positively correlated with knowledge in managing dental trauma.	[Cheung, L.

Increased activity of APE1, often observed in tumor cells, is thought to contribute to resistance to various anticancer drugs, whereas down-regulation of APE1 sensitizes cells to DNA damaging agents. Thus, inhibiting APE1 repair endonuclease function in cancer cells is considered a promising strategy to overcome therapeutic agent resistance. Despite ongoing efforts, inhibitors of APE1 with adequate drug-like properties have yet to be discovered. Using a kinetic fluorescence assay, we conducted a fully-automated high-throughput screen (HTS) of the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR), as well as additional public collections, with each compound tested as a 7-concentration series in a 4 mu L reaction volume. Actives identified from the screen were subjected to a panel of confirmatory and counterscreen tests. Several active molecules were identified that inhibited APE1 in two independent assay formats and exhibited potentiation of the genotoxic effect of methyl methanesulfonate with a concomitant increase in AP sites, a hallmark of intracellular APE1 inhibition; a number of these chemotypes could be good starting points for further medicinal chemistry optimization. To our knowledge, this represents the largest-scale HTS to identify inhibitors of APE1, and provides a key first step in the development of novel agents targeting BER for cancer treatment.

This paper aimed to determine the relationship between indoor environment and sleep quality based on subjective questionnaires and objective measurements. First, a massive online investigation was conducted in China to collect basic information, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire, and information on sleep environment control method from respondents. The main qualitative conclusion from this investigation was that individuals have differing perceptions of the effects of environment on sleep quality. Sleep quality varies based on age and personal salary. Gender differences were also discussed in the online investigation. Men tended to have poorer sleep quality than women. To quantitatively explore the effects of indoor environment on sleep quality, a field study was conducted in university dormitories. The field study involved the measurement of various environmental and physiological parameters, and used subjective questionnaires before and after sleep. Preference for different environmental parameters relating to sleep quality were discussed. The most satisfactory operative temperature was found to be 24.2 degrees C, and subjects have a lower neutral temperature and a broader accepted temperature range during sleep. A multivariate analysis indicated that several environmental factors thought to disturb sleep are interrelated and therefore require more transactional analysis and research.

Effect of Al addition on properties of Cu<sub>45</sub>Zr<sub>45.5</sub>Ti<sub>9.5</sub> bulk metallic glass	MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article						Cu-based glass forming alloy; Thermal property; Mechanical property; Corrosion; Al addition	CU-ZR-TI; FORMING ABILITY; CORROSION BEHAVIOR; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; THERMAL-STABILITY; B2 CUZR; MARTENSITIC-TRANSFORMATION; COMPOSITION DESIGN; MIXING ENTHALPY; PLASTICITY	The thermal, mechanical and corrosive properties of (Cu45Zr45.5Ti9.5)(100)Al--x(x) (x = 0-0.25 at%) glass forming alloys were systematically studied. The thermal measurements show that Al microalloying leads to increase of glass transition temperature but decrease of supercooled liquid region. The glass transition activation energy slightly increases and then decreases with increasing Al content. The room-temperature compression tests demonstrate that all studied Cu-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) exhibit work-hardening behavior, but the work-hardening capacity depends on Al content. In addition, yield strength, fracture strength and fracture strain are drastically increased by Al addition. The largest plasticity of (Cu45Zr45.5Ti9.5)(99.8)Al-0.2 BMG is 6 times larger than that of the Al-free Cu-based BMG. Moreover, the electrochemical measurements indicate that the Al minor addition cause the decrease of both corrosion potential and corrosion current density. The corrosion behavior gradually transforms from the pitting corrosion to the self-passivization with increasing Al content. The local heterogeneity of Al element is thought to be the reason for the performance change of the studied Cu-based BMGs. The present results would provide a new insight into the mechanism for the microalloying effect on the properties of the metallic glasses.	[Cai, A. H.; Tan, Jing; An, Q.; Zhou, G.

The emergence of multiprocessor machines allows the development of more aggressive database designs, which in turn need very complicated query optimizers. We present the Workload Partitioning Segment of DOME, a query optimization environment developed on an Intel i860 hypercube system. DOME calculates the distribution of the query input relations and uniformly allocates the workload associated with the resolution of a query on the nodes of a multiprocessor system. The workload is uniformly allocated even when the input relations exhibit a high degree of skew. A priori information of the degree of skew is unnecessary. DOME provides routines to perform the relational operations in parallel on all nodes of the hypercube system. We tested DOME with various sizes, and degree of skew of the input relations. We describe the theoretical foundation behind the optimization techniques employed and present graphs that portray the performance of DOME and its scalability.

Because of the hydrophobic nature of CoQ(10), it is reasonable to assume that it could be encapsulated within a liposomal carrier. Several reports regarding the packaging of CoQ(10) in liposomes have appeared, but detailed investigations of the preparation of CoQ(10) encapsulated liposomes have not been reported. As a result, information regarding the optimal method of packaging CoQ(10) in liposomes is not available. In this study, several types of liposomes were prepared using different methods and their characteristics were compared. Since CoQ(10) is mainly located in the inner mitochondria! membrane, a liposome that targets mitochondria, a MITO-Porter, was used as a model liposome. It was possible to incorporate high levels of CoQ(10) into the carrier. Transmission electron microscopy analyses showed that an empty MITO-Porter and the CoQ(10)-MITO-Porter were structurally different from one another. Even though significant structural differences were observed, mitochondria! delivery was not affected in mitochondria! disease fibroblast cells, as evidenced by confocal laser scanning microscopy observations. The results reported herein suggest that the CoQ(10)-MITO-Porter might be a suitable candidate for the potential medical therapy of mitochondria-related diseases.

How Attention Can Create Synaptic Tags for the Learning of Working Memories in Sequential Tasks	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; COMPUTATIONAL MODEL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CIRCUIT MECHANISM; ACTION SELECTION; BASAL FOREBRAIN; NEURAL-NETWORKS; NUCLEUS BASALIS; DECISION; REINFORCEMENT	Intelligence is our ability to learn appropriate responses to new stimuli and situations. Neurons in association cortex are thought to be essential for this ability. During learning these neurons become tuned to relevant features and start to represent them with persistent activity during memory delays. This learning process is not well understood. Here we develop a biologically plausible learning scheme that explains how trial-and-error learning induces neuronal selectivity and working memory representations for task-relevant information. We propose that the response selection stage sends attentional feedback signals to earlier processing levels, forming synaptic tags at those connections responsible for the stimulus-response mapping. Globally released neuromodulators then interact with tagged synapses to determine their plasticity. The resulting learning rule endows neural networks with the capacity to create new working memory representations of task relevant information as persistent activity. It is remarkably generic: it explains how association neurons learn to store task-relevant information for linear as well as non-linear stimulus-response mappings, how they become tuned to category boundaries or analog variables, depending on the task demands, and how they learn to integrate probabilistic evidence for perceptual decisions.

Red squirrel territorial vocalizations deter intrusions by conspecific rivals	BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						mammalian vocalimtions; acoustic communication; territoriality; speaker occupation; red squirrel	VOCAL BEHAVIOR; WINGED BLACKBIRDS; ACOUSTIC-SIGNALS; SONG SPARROWS; DEFENSE; CALLS; FEMALE; INFORMATION; PLAYBACK; DISCRIMINATION	In many species. territory advertisement is thought to be one of the primary functions of acoustic communication. North American red squirrels are a territorial species in which 'rattles' have long been thought to be the principal signal communicating territory ownership. These vocalizations have been assumed to deter intruders, thus reducing energetic costs and the risk of injury associated with direct aggressive interactions. However, this hypothesis has not been directly tested. Here we used a speaker occupation experiment to test whether red squirrel rattles function to deter conspecific rivals. We studied 29 male squirrels and removed each individual from his territory twice in a paired design. During the experimental treatment, we simulated the owner's presence after its removal by broadcasting the owner's rattle from a loudspeaker at the centre of the territory once every 7 min. During the control treatment, the territory was left in silence following the temporary removal of the owner. We found that the presence of a speaker replacement reduced the probability of intrusion by 34% and increased the latency to first intrusion by 7%. providing support for the hypothesis that rattles play an active role in reducing intrusion risk. However, intrusions were not completely averted by the speaker replacement, indicating that for some individuals vocalizations alone are not a sufficient deterrent without other cues of the territory owner.

Multivariate modelling of responses to conditional items: New possibilities for latent class analysis	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						conditional items; latent class analysis; finite mixture; EM algorithm; wheezing	1ST 6 YEARS; PHENOTYPES	Questionnaire data may contain missing Values because certain questions do not apply to all respondents. For instance, questions addressing particular attributes of a symptom, Such as frequency, triggers or seasonality, are only applicable to those who have experienced the symptom, while for those who have not, responses to these items will be missing. This missing information does not fall into the category,missing by design', rather the features of interest do not exist and cannot be measured regardless of survey design. Analysis of responses to such conditional items is therefore typically restricted to the subpopulation in which they apply. This article is concerned with joint multivariate modelling of responses to both unconditional and conditional items without restricting the analysis to this subpopulation. Such an approach is of interest when the distributions of both types of responses are thought to be determined by common parameters affecting the whole population. By integrating the conditional item structure into the model, inference can be based both on unconditional data from the entire population and on conditional data from subjects for whom they exist. This approach opens new possibilities for multivariate analysis of such data. We apply this approach to latent class modelling and provide an example using data on respiratory symptoms (wheeze and cough) in children. Conditional data structures such as that considered here are common in medical research settings and, although our focus is Oil latent class models, the approach can be applied to other multivariate models.

Richard			Unconsciously Triggered Conflict Adaptation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SEQUENTIAL MODULATIONS; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION; MOTOR; MECHANISMS; ABSENCE; TASK	In conflict tasks such as the Stroop, the Eriksen flanker or the Simon task, it is generally observed that the detection of conflict in the current trial reduces the impact of conflicting information in the subsequent trial; a phenomenon termed conflict adaptation. This higher-order cognitive control function has been assumed to be restricted to cases where conflict is experienced consciously. In the present experiment we manipulated the awareness of conflict-inducing stimuli in a metacontrast masking paradigm to directly test this assumption. Conflicting response tendencies were elicited either consciously (through primes that were weakly masked) or unconsciously (strongly masked primes). We demonstrate trial-by-trial conflict adaptation effects after conscious as well as unconscious conflict, which could not be explained by direct stimulus/response repetitions. These findings show that unconscious information can have a longer-lasting influence on our behavior than previously thought and further stretch the functional boundaries of unconscious cognition.

The main objective of this the JA-InfAct is to build an EU health information system infrastructure and strengthen its core elements by a) establishing a sustainable research infrastructure to support population health and health system performance assessment, b) enhancing the European health information and knowledge bases, as well as health information research capacities to reduce health information inequalities, and c) supporting health information interoperability and innovative health information tools and data sources. Methods Following a federated analysis approach, JA-InfAct developed an ad hoc federated infrastructure based on distributing a well-defined process-mining analysis methodology to be deployed at each participating partners' systems to reproduce the analysis and pool the aggregated results from the analyses. To overcome the legal interoperability issues on international data sharing, data linkage and management, partners (EU regions) participating in the case studies worked coordinately to query their real-world healthcare data sources complying with a common data model, executed the process-mining analysis pipeline on their premises, and shared the results enabling international comparison and the identification of best practices on stroke care. Results The ad hoc federated infrastructure was designed and built upon open source technologies, providing partners with the capacity to exploit their data and generate dashboards exploring the stroke care pathways. These dashboards can be shared among the participating partners or to a coordination hub without legal issues, enabling the comparative evaluation of the caregiving activities for acute stroke across regions. Nonetheless, the approach is not free of a number of challenges that have been solved, and new challenges that should be addressed in the eventual case of scaling up. For that eventual case, 12 recommendations considering the different layers of interoperability have been provided. Conclusion The proposed approach, when successfully deployed as a federated analysis infrastructure, such as the one developed within the JA-InfAct, can concisely tackle all levels of the interoperability requirements from organisational to technical interoperability, supported by the close collaboration of the partners participating in the study. Any proposal for extension, should require further thinking on how to deal with new challenges on interoperability.

J	Li, J; Qin, XH				Li, Jing; Qin, Xinghong			Efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction on fear of emotions and related cognitive behavioral processes in Chinese University students: A randomized controlled trial	PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS			English	Article						decentering; difficulties in emotion regulation; fear of emotions; mindfulness-based stress reduction; rumination	AFFECTIVE CONTROL SCALE; ANXIETY; HAPPINESS; RUMINATION; AVOIDANCE; MODEL; CARE; DYSREGULATION; DIFFICULTIES; ALEXITHYMIA	Fear of losing control over one's emotions has gained increased research interest. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been found to improve emotional disturbance in clinical and nonclinical samples. However, no studies have concurrently examined the direct effects of MBSR on reduced fear of emotions among university students in Chinese culture, as well as its indirect effects on reduced fear of emotions via improvements in the cognitive-behavioral processes. A total of 106 college students were randomly assigned to MBSR or to a control group. Assignment to the MBSR intervention led to increases in mindfulness and decentering, and decreases in rumination, emotion regulation difficulties, Affective Control Scale (ACS)-anger, ACS-depression, ACS-anxiety, ACS-positive emotion and total ACS score, as compared to the control group. The reduction of fear of positive emotion was less than that in fear of anger, depression and anxiety. MBSR was effective to reduce the fear of emotions in college students. Moreover, college students in Chinese culture tended to have a more moderate experience of positive emotions. Attention (mindfulness) and thought (decentering and rumination) may be possible cognitive mechanisms for explaining how MBSR may reduce fear of emotions in college students. Our findings provide important information that can be applied to the design of future studies or mental health resources for reducing fear of emotions in university programs.

Intraoperative MRI in pediatric brain tumors	PEDIATRIC RADIOLOGY			English	Article						Brain tumor; Magnetic resonance imaging; Intraoperative imaging; Children	NEUROSURGERY; ANESTHESIA; EXPERIENCE; IMPLEMENTATION	Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) has emerged as an important tool in guiding the surgical management of children with brain tumors. Recent advances have allowed utilization of high field strength systems, including 3-tesla MRI, resulting in diagnostic-quality scans that can be performed while the child is on the operating table. By providing information about the possible presence of residual tumor, it allows the neurosurgeon to both identify and resect any remaining tumor that is thought to be safely accessible. By fusing the newly obtained images with the surgical guidance software, the images have the added value of aiding in navigation to any residual tumor. This is important because parenchyma often shifts during surgery. It also gives the neurosurgeon insight into whether any immediate postoperative complications have occurred. If any complications have occurred, the child is already in the operating room and precious minutes lost in transport and communications are saved. In this article we review the three main approaches to an iMRI system design. We discuss the possible roles for iMRI during intraoperative planning and provide guidance to help radiologists and neurosurgeons alike in the collaborative management of these children.

The adoption of a CD4 T cell helper peptide in the vaccine is thought to be beneficial for the enhancement of immune responses, however, its effect on HSV-2 vaccines has not yet been studied. In this study, we designed a DNA vaccine (gD-TpD) simultaneously expressing HSV-2 gD ectodomain and a universal CD4 T cell helper peptide (TpD), and tested its efficacy on a murine model. Mice were immunized 3 times with gD-TpD or control DNA formulations, and then were rested until Day 150 when they were vaginally challenged with lethal doses of HSV-2. Our data showed that gD-TpD significantly increased gD-specific IgG and IgA in both sera and vaginal washes. Furthermore, the increased antibody responses showed enhanced neutralization activity in vitro. In addition, gD-TpD induced balanced Th1/2 cellular responses and CD8(+) T cell-dependent CTL activity. Although immune responses dropped over time after the final immunization, robust and rapid antibody and T cell responses were induced upon virus challenge in gD-TpD group. Moreover, gD-TpD provided full protection against lethal viral challenge in immunized mice. Together, our findings indicate that the inclusion of the CD4 T cell helper peptide TpD in HSV-2 gD subunit vaccine could induce long-term protective immunity, providing information for a rational design of vaccines against HSV-2 or even other viruses.

Reports of gabapentin and pregabalin abuse, misuse, dependence, or overdose: An analysis of the Food And Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS)	RESEARCH IN SOCIAL & ADMINISTRATIVE PHARMACY			English	Article						Gabapentin; Pregabalin; FAERS; Prescription drug abuse	DELIRIUM; SIGNAL; PAIN	Background: Reports of gabapentinoid (gabapentin and pregabalin) misuse have increased in recent years. Pharmacovigilance data from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) provides a useful examination of adverse drug event (ADE) reporting for safety signal detection. Objective: This study was conducted to analyze epidemiological information on the nature and extent of gabapentin/pregabalin abuse utilizing the FAERS database. Methods: A query was designed utilizing SafeRx, an indexed, searchable database of FAERS data from October 2012-December 2016. All-cause and abuse-related (including abuse/misuse/dependence/overdose events) ADE reports for gabapentin and pregabalin were isolated, as well as limited demographic data. The proportional reporting ratio (PRR) was calculated to compare signal detection. Results: A total of 10,038 all-cause ADEs were reported to FAERS for gabapentin, including 576 (5.7%) abuse-related events. For pregabalin, 571 all-cause ADEs were identified, including 58 (10.2%) related to abuse. Compared to all-cause ADEs, those involved in abuse-related events were younger and more likely to be male. The PRR of pregabalin versus gabapentin abuse-related events was 1.77. Conclusion: Though not traditionally thought of as drugs of abuse, over 600 cases of gabapentinoid abuse were reported in the time frame analyzed, prompting the need for further study and regulatory investigation.

Cephalopod fisheries show marked inter-annual fluctuations unrelated to fishery landings and effort. Their population dynamics, particularly recruitment, are thought to be strongly susceptible to changes in environmental conditions. This arises in part from the short life cycle, resulting in poor buffering of the population against changing conditions. These characteristics make traditional approaches to stock assessment and fishery management inappropriate. GIS offers a tool to improve understanding of spatio-temporal trends in abundance and facilitate rational management. A cephalopod fishery geographical information system for Northeast Atlantic waters (CFGIS-NEA) was developed. The system covers the area from 28.0 degrees W to 11.0 degrees E, and 34.5 degrees N to 65.5 degrees N. It was designed for investigating cephalopod resource dynamics in relation to environmental variation. It is based on Unix Arc/Info, and PC ArcView, combined with the statistical software package S-PLUS and supported by a database in Microsoft Access. Environmental data (e.g. sea surface temperature and salinity, sea bottom temperature and salinity, and bathymetric data), cephalopod fishery, survey and biological data, from a variety of sources, were integrated in the GIS as coverages, grids, shapefiles, and tables. Special functions were developed for data integration, data conversion, query, visualisation, analysis and management. User-friendly interfaces were developed allowing relatively inexperienced users to operate the system. The spatial and temporal distribution patterns of cephalopod abundance by species, the spatial and temporal relationships between cephalopod abundance and environmental factors, and the spatial and temporal patterns of cephalopod fishing activity were analysed using a combination of visual (qualitative) and quantitative methods. Predictive empirical models, such as GAMs (generalized additive models), were developed for modelling cephalopod abundance using environmental variables.

Alterations in Functional Activation in Euthymic Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia During a Working Memory Task	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						bipolar; schizophrenia; working memory; executive function; fMRI; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RATING-SCALE; NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; BRAIN IMAGES; FMRI; PERFORMANCE; MRI; DYSFUNCTION; IMPAIRMENT	Dysfunctions in prefrontal cortical networks are thought to underlie working memory (WM) impairments consistently observed in both subjects with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. It remains unclear, however, whether patterns of WM-related hemodynamic responses are similar in bipolar and schizophrenia subjects compared to controls. We used fMRI to investigate differences in blood oxygen level dependent activation during a WM task in 21 patients with euthymic bipolar 1, 20 patients with schizophrenia, and 38 healthy controls. Subjects were presented with four stimuli (abstract designs) followed by a fifth stimulus and required to recall whether the last stimulus was among the four presented previously. Task-related brain activity was compared within and across groups. All groups activated prefrontal cortex (PFC), primary and supplementary motor cortex, and visual cortex during the WM task. There were no significant differences in PFC activation between controls and euthymic bipolar subjects, but controls exhibited significantly increased activation (cluster-corrected P < 0.05) compared to patients with schizophrenia in prefrontal regions including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Although the bipolar group exhibited intermediate percent signal change in a functionally defined DLPFC region of interest with respect to the schizophrenia and control groups, effects remained significant only between patients with schizophrenia and controls. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may share some behavioral, diagnostic, and genetic features. Differences in the patterns of WM-related brain activity across groups, however, suggest some diagnostic specificity. Both patient groups showed some regional task-related hypoactivation compared to controls across the brain. Within DLPFC specifically, patients with schizophrenia exhibited more severe WM-related dysfunction than bipolar subjects. Hunt Brain Mapp 30:3958-3969, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

SPINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	31st Annual Meeting of the Scoliosis-Research-Society	SEP 25-28, 1996	OTTAWA, CANADA	Scoliosis Res Soc		adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; body image; psychosocial; risk factors; scoliosis; suicide	ADOLESCENT IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS; HEALTH-STATUS; CHILD HEALTH; PROFILE; OUTCOMES; COHORT; STRESS; IMAGE; SELF	Study Design. A population-based case-control study, we identified adolescents with and without scoli osis in Minnesota who were 12 through 18 years of age. Matched control subjects were randomly selected from school children who did not have scoliosis or any other condition. Information on scoliosis was obtained by a self-administered questionnaire, the Adolescent Health Survey. Collected on more than 75,000 school age adolescents, with established validity and reliability, a secondary analysis of adolescents with scoliosis was performed as compared with a normative peer group. Objective. To describe and characterize the psyche social impact of scoliosis on the areas of peer relations, body image, and health-compromising behavior, such as suicidal thought and alcohol consumption. Summary of Background Data. The impact of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis has not been assessed using generic health status measures appropriate for adolescents. Previous studies have concentrated on the health status of adults by measuring work status, marriage status, and other adult measures. The purpose of this study was to study the health status of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, using the Adolescent Health Survey, a generic health status measure with established validity and reliability. Methods. Body image, peer relations, social and high-risk behavior, and comparative health were assessed to determine if scoliosis was an independent risk factor and to determine if scoliosis was associated with these psychosocial issues. Results. Six hundred eighty-five cases of scoliosis were identified from the 34,706 adolescents. The prevalence was 1.97%. Of the 685 adolescents with scoliosis and their control subjects, the adjusted odds ratio for having suicidal thought among adolescents with scoliosis, compared to adolescents without scoliosis, was 1.40 (P value of 0.04) after adjustment for race, gender, socioeconomic status, and age. The adjusted odds ratio for having feelings about poor body development among adolescents with scoliosis was 1.82 (P value 0.001) compared with adolescents without scoliosis after adjustment for race, gender, socioeconomic status, and age. Scoliosis was an independent risk factor for suicidal thought, worry and concern over body development, and peer interactions after adjustment. Conclusion. Scoliosis is a significant risk factor for psychosocial issues and health-compromising behavior. Gender differences exist in male and female adolescents with scoliosis.

However, there have been no known studies investigating parent attitudes to, and satisfaction with, UNHS since its launch in Hong Kong. The present study aimed to investigate knowledge of UNHS as well as infant hearing development, and attitudes and satisfaction with UNHS, in Hong Kong mothers with newborns. The study was designed to help evaluate and improve an established UNHS public hospital program, based on the perspectives of service users. Methods: A researcher-developed questionnaire was administered to 102 mothers whose newborn had received UNHS in the postnatal wards of a large public hospital in Hong Kong. The questionnaire considered parental knowledge of UNHS and infant hearing development, attitudes and satisfaction toward public hospital UNHS. In the knowledge dimension, parents' preferred time and location for pre-test information delivery, interpretation of screening results, and knowledge of hearing developmental milestones were surveyed. In addition, maternal attitudes to and satisfaction with UNHS screening services, the potential impact of UNHS on parent emotions and parent-baby bonding, attitudes toward informed consent, and willingness to comply with diagnostic assessment referral were also be surveyed. Results: Mean participant scores on knowledge of infant hearing development were relatively low (M = 2.59/6.0, SD = 0.90). Many mothers also underestimated the potential ongoing risks of hearing impairment in babies. Around 80% of mothers thought an infant could not have hearing impairment after passing the screening. In addition, one-third of mothers thought a baby could not later develop hearing impairment in infancy or childhood. In terms of attitudes and satisfaction, participants gave somewhat negative ratings for questions regarding receiving sufficient information about the screening (M = 2.90/5.0, SD = 1.27), screening procedure (M = 2.20/5.0, SD = 1.08), and sufficiency of information about results (M = 2.87/5.0, SD = 1.14). Nonetheless, participants gave positive ratings concerning whether screening could lead to early diagnosis (M = 4.61/5.0, SD = 0.57) and over 95% of mothers supported UNHS despite potential for false positive results. Mothers reported a high willingness to bring their baby to follow-up assessments if required (M = 4.53/5.0, SD = 0.56). Participants gave positive ratings for their level of satisfaction with the time and location of first UNHS information provision (M = 4.34/5.0, SD = 0.80) and the way permission was asked for screening the baby (M = 4.04/5.0, SD = 0.97) but alternative procedures were also recommended. Most recommendations focused on providing more information about the test and a more detailed explanation of screening results. Conclusions: The survey results highlighted the need to provide more information to parents about infant hearing development to support home monitoring for signs of hearing loss after UNHS, as well as more detailed explanation and information regarding hearing screening and the implications of results to parents. Regardless of location, surveys of this type may provide valuable support for UNHS program quality assurance.

There is great theoretical and practical value in building theories that can be used to explain or to predict variations in cognitive control as a function of experimental manipulations or individual differences. A critical step toward building such theories is determining which latent constructs are shared between laboratory tasks that are designed to measure cognitive control. In the current work, we examine this question in a novel way by formally linking computational models of two canonical cognitive control tasks, the Eriksen flanker and task-switching task. Specifically, we examine whether model parameters that capture cognitive control processes in one task can be swapped across models to make predictions about individual differences in performance on another task. We apply our modeling and analysis to a large scale data set from an online cognitive training platform, which optimizes our ability to detect individual differences in the data. Our results suggest that the flanker and task-switching tasks probe common control processes. This finding supports the view that higher level cognitive control processes as opposed to solely strategies in speed and accuracy tradeoffs, or perceptual processing and motor response speed are shared across the two tasks. We discuss how our computational modeling substitution approach addresses limitations of prior efforts to relate performance across different cognitive control tasks, and how our findings inform current theories of cognitive control.

J	Qiao, WG; Chen, X				Qiao, Wanguan; Chen, Xue			Connotation, characteristics and framework of coal mine safety big data	HELIYON			English	Article						Data -driven; CMSBD; Management connotation; Safety features; Research paradigm	DECISION-MAKING; MANAGEMENT; PERSPECTIVE; INTERNET; ERA; OPPORTUNITIES; INTELLIGENCE; QUESTIONS; PARADIGM; PLATFORM	With the continuous development of automation and information technology, large amounts of safety data are produced in the processes of coal production. Most enterprises simply focus on statistics and do not conduct systematic big data analyses. Therefore, it is necessary to study the theory of coal mine safety while using big data systematically. This paper expounds on the changes in coal mine safety that have been driven by big data from three aspects: the connotation, characteristics and research framework. First, the connotation of coal mine safety big data (CMSBD) is redefined by changing the safety entities and methods. Second, the advantages and disad-vantages of the big data model are compared from the perspective of feature analysis. Finally, the research paradigm and technical framework of CMSBD are designed. The results show that the management connotation of CMSBD focuses on the role of big data in coal mine safety. Compared with coal mine safety small data (CMSSD), CMSBD has both advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, CMSBD must be combined with a small data method. The research paradigm emphasizes the intersection of the research, the relevance of safety thinking, the importance of safety data analysis, and the fusion of big data with traditional small data models.

This triggered a lively debate on the epistemological and methodological traditions, preferences, and research practices of Europeans versus North Americans that has lasted until today. Is it still true, we asked ourselves, that European scholars generate less academic impact than their North American colleagues? Is the European research context indeed disadvantageous for developing high academic impact research? In this paper, we set out to explore these questions by analysing the Google Scholar profiles of 1713 IS researchers from all over the world. Our findings show that Northern and Western European scholars no longer seem to differ significantly from their North American peers, even though the different research contexts still exercise a certain level of influence. However, is this a development the "old world" desires? We provide an assessment and some suggestions for the future of European IS research.

This isolates the influence of HfO2 deposition on low-temperature carrier transport and shows that carrier mobility is not charge impurity limited as commonly thought, but due to another important but commonly overlooked factor: interface roughness. This finding is corroborated by circular dichroic photoluminescence spectroscopy, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy, carrier-transport modeling, and density functional modeling. Finally, electrostatic gate-defined quantum confinement is demonstrated using a scalable approach of large-area CVD-grown bilayer WS2 and ALD-grown HfO2. The high dielectric constant and low leakage current enabled by HfO2 allows an estimated quantum dot size as small as 58 nm. The ability to lithographically define increasingly smaller devices is especially important for transition metal dichalcogenides due to their large effective masses, and should pave the way toward their use in quantum information processing applications.

Balanced Excitatory and Inhibitory Synaptic Currents Promote Efficient Coding and Metabolic Efficiency	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; GRANULE CELLS; TIME-COURSE; ENERGY; INTEGRATION; CONDUCTANCES; COMPUTATION; ACTIVATION; SUMMATION; CIRCUITS	A balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents is thought to be important for several aspects of information processing in cortical neurons in vivo, including gain control, bandwidth and receptive field structure. These factors will affect the firing rate of cortical neurons and their reliability, with consequences for their information coding and energy consumption. Yet how balanced synaptic currents contribute to the coding efficiency and energy efficiency of cortical neurons remains unclear. We used single compartment computational models with stochastic voltage-gated ion channels to determine whether synaptic regimes that produce balanced excitatory and inhibitory currents have specific advantages over other input regimes. Specifically, we compared models with only excitatory synaptic inputs to those with equal excitatory and inhibitory conductances, and stronger inhibitory than excitatory conductances (i.e. approximately balanced synaptic currents). Using these models, we show that balanced synaptic currents evoke fewer spikes per second than excitatory inputs alone or equal excitatory and inhibitory conductances. However, spikes evoked by balanced synaptic inputs are more informative (bits/spike), so that spike trains evoked by all three regimes have similar information rates (bits/s). Consequently, because spikes dominate the energy consumption of our computational models, approximately balanced synaptic currents are also more energy efficient than other synaptic regimes. Thus, by producing fewer, more informative spikes approximately balanced synaptic currents in cortical neurons can promote both coding efficiency and energy efficiency.

Although the extensive diversity of this protein has been highlighted by different GAS typing schemes, most of the structural and functional information has been obtained from a limited number of types. Increasing numbers of epidemiological, clinical and biological reports suggest that the structure and function of the M protein is less conserved than previously thought. This review focuses on the known interactions between M proteins and host ligand proteins, emphasizing that our understanding of this well-studied molecule is fragmented.

This process is not only ongoing but also accelerating. For the children who will inevitably grow up in this environment of change, we have done little to update the institution of education. The field of design has a great deal to offer children at this time. The thinking processes and multimodal approaches can, in part, provide the foundation for the skills that children will need for the necessary innovations of the future. The following article makes further recommendations for creativity as the next essential literacy for our children.				srmarcus@mac.com							3	1	1	0	4	JOHN WILEY & SONS INC	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA	1532-2882			J AM SOC INF SCI TEC	J.

J	Xie, R; Luo, MQ; Chen, ZK; Liu, WH				Xie, Ran; Luo, Mingqiang; Chen, Zikun; Liu, Wenhao			A Multi-CBR Algorithm Based on Comprehensive Evaluation for Operation Planning of Helicopter	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Comprehensive evaluation; case adaptation; helicopter; multi-CBR; operation planning	DECISION-MAKING; MODEL	Case-based reasoning (CBR) is an effective reasoning technology. The core idea of CBR is using past experience and expert knowledge to solve new problems. Operation planning of helicopter mainly relies on the experiences of the decision-maker, so CBR is an effective reasoning technology which can be used in the operation planning. Two key issues, evaluation method and case adaptation, are widely focused in CBR method. However, the existing CBR is not suitable for non-numeric optimization problem such as operation planning, because it belongs to small sample size problem. To solve this problem, the comprehensive evaluation based multi-CBR (CEB-mCBR) method is proposed in this paper, which can be used for operation planning of helicopter. According to the comprehensive evaluation theory, similar historical case set of the target case is established, and the historical operation plans are ranked. On this basis, the optimum initial plan for the target case is generated by the case screening CBR model. Then the solution element screening CBR model is further put forward to solve the issue of case adaptation. The CEB-mCBR method comprises multi-CBR (case screening CBR and solution element screening CBR) and combination evaluation method. It can integrate expert experience and human thinking better, especially when solution space is limited. Finally, through a case study analysis, the multi-CBR model can generate a feasible solution for the target case, and the solution elements can be adjusted according to the situation in the actual operation, which can improve the efficiency of operation planning while keeping the safety, economy and operating efficiency.

Population Dynamics of Aerial and Terrestrial Populations of <i>Phytophthora ramorum</i> in a California Forest Under Different Climatic Conditions	PHYTOPATHOLOGY			English	Article						genetic diversity; genetic structure; multilocus genotypes	GENOTYPIC DIVERSITY; GENETIC DIVERSITY; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; HOST GENOTYPE; PATHOGEN; DISPERSAL; TREES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; TRANSMISSION; EVOLUTION	Limited information is available on how soil and leaf populations of the sudden oak death pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, may differ in their response to changing weather conditions, and their corresponding role in initiating the next disease cycle after unfavorable weather conditions. We sampled and cultured from 425 trees in six sites, three times at the end of a 3-year-long drought and twice during a wet year that followed. Soil was also sampled twice with similar frequency and design used for sampling leaves. Ten microsatellites were used for genetic analyses on cultures from successful isolations. Results demonstrated that incidence of leaf infection tripled at the onset of the first wet period in 3 years in spring 2010, while that of soil populations remained unchanged. Migration of genotypes among sites was low and spatially limited under dry periods but intensity and range of migration of genotypes significantly increased for leaf populations during wet periods. Only leaf genotypes persisted significantly between years, and genotypes present in different substrates distributed differently in soil and leaves. We conclude that epidemics start rapidly at the onset of favorable climatic conditions through highly transmissible leaf genotypes, and that soil populations are transient and may be less epidemiologically relevant than previously thought.

J	Squires, JE; Estabrooks, CA; Gustavsson, P; Wallin, L				Squires, Janet E.; Estabrooks, Carole A.; Gustavsson, Petter; Wallin, Lars			Individual determinants of research utilization by nurses: a systematic review update	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Review							NURSING PRACTICE; KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION; CARE; QUALITY; DISSEMINATION; PERCEPTIONS; EDUCATORS; BARRIERS; MIDWIVES; BEHAVIOR	Background: Interventions that have a better than random chance of increasing nurses' use of research are important to the delivery of quality patient care. However, few reports exist of successful research utilization in nursing interventions. Systematic identification and evaluation of individual characteristics associated with and predicting research utilization may inform the development of research utilization interventions. Objective: To update the evidence published in a previous systematic review on individual characteristics influencing research utilization by nurses. Methods: As part of a larger systematic review on research utilization instruments, 12 online bibliographic databases were searched. Hand searching of specialized journals and an ancestry search was also conducted. Randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, and observational study designs examining the association between individual characteristics and nurses' use of research were eligible for inclusion. Studies were limited to those published in the English, Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian languages. A vote counting approach to data synthesis was taken. Results: A total of 42,770 titles were identified, of which 501 were retrieved. Of these 501 articles, 45 satisfied our inclusion criteria. Articles assessed research utilization in general (n = 39) or kinds of research utilization (n = 6) using self-report survey measures. Individual nurse characteristics were classified according to six categories: beliefs and attitudes, involvement in research activities, information seeking, education, professional characteristics, and socio-demographic/socio-economic characteristics. A seventh category, critical thinking, emerged in studies examining kinds of research utilization. Positive relationships, at statistically significant levels, for general research utilization were found in four categories: beliefs and attitudes, information seeking, education, and professional characteristics. The only characteristic assessed in a sufficient number of studies and with consistent findings for the kinds of research utilization was attitude towards research; this characteristic had a positive association with instrumental and overall research utilization. Conclusions: This review reinforced conclusions in the previous review with respect to positive relationships between general research utilization and: beliefs and attitudes, and current role. Furthermore, attending conferences/in-services, having a graduate degree in nursing, working in a specialty area, and job satisfaction were also identified as individual characteristics important to research utilization. While these findings hold promise as potential targets of future research utilization interventions, there were methodological problems inherent in many of the studies that necessitate their findings be replicated in further research using more robust study designs and multivariate assessment methods.

Asymmetry of the stimulus pulse waveform was thought to be necessary for therapeutic effectiveness, but asymmetrical pulses require significant electrical energy that constrains clinical delivery systems to suboptimal designs. Development of low-energy consuming stimuli will enable clinical device improvements and may provide additional information about the interaction of electromagnetic fields with tissues. The objectives of this study were (a) to determine if asymmetry of the stimulus pulse waveform is needed for efficacy and (b) to determine if symmetrical pulse waveform stimuli also can produce a beneficial therapeutic response. The rabbit fibular osteotomy model was used to answer these questions and to identify which components of the clinically used asymmetrical PEMF produce the therapeutic response. The results suggest that asymmetry is not necessary and that a narrow pulse width, symmetrical square wave signal can also stimulate stiffness increases in this model. The data also suggest that the high-amplitude, narrow-pulse portion of the asymmetrical PEMF is the principal component of the signal pulse that is responsible for the clinical therapeutic effect.

A new generation of adjuvants is being developed to meet the demands for more potent antigen-specific responses, specific types of immune responses, and a high margin of safety. Nanotechnology provides a multifunctional stage for the integration of desired adjuvant activities performed by the building blocks of tailor-designed nanoparticles. Using nanomaterials for antigen delivery can provide high bioavailability, sustained and controlled release profiles, and targeting and imaging properties resulting from manipulation of the nanomaterials' physicochemical properties. Moreover, the inherent immune-regulating activity of particular nanomaterials can further promote and shape the cellular and humoral immune responses toward desired types. The combination of both the delivery function and immunomodulatory effect of nanomaterials as adjuvants is thought to largely benefit the immune outcomes of vaccination. In this review, we will address the current achievements of nanotechnology in the development of novel adjuvants. The potential mechanisms by which nanomaterials impact the immune responses to a vaccine and how physicochemical properties, including size, surface charge and surface modification, impact their resulting immunological outcomes will be discussed. This review aims to provide concentrated information to promote new insights for the development of novel vaccine adjuvants.

Operationalizing Urie Bronfenbrenner's Process-Person-Context-Time Model	HUMAN DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Bronfenbrenner; Developmental psychology; Methodology; Process-person-context-time model; Review	ECOLOGY; CHILD	Urie Bronfenbrenner spent much of his academic life designing and then refining what came to be known as the bioecological theory of human development. During this process, he came to a working operationalization of his theory - what he termed the process-person-context-time (PPCT) model. However, for all of the effort that he put into refining the theory, he provided very little information on how to apply the theory, or even the PPCT model, in research. In this paper we therefore suggest a way in which the theory can be operationalized more effectively, laying out the steps that we think should be followed. Specifically, these include (a) deciding on the developmental outcome of interest; (b) operationalizing the proximal processes most relevant to the outcome of interest; (c) operationalizing relevant person, context, and time factors, such that at least two contexts are included, in both contexts can be found persons who vary in their characteristics of interest, and data are gathered over time. Finally, and most importantly, the researcher must take seriously the fact that these interacting variables operate synergistically rather than independently. In this paper, our aim is to explain the importance of these four aspects and provide examples to help researchers who wish to use bioecological theory as its author intended. (C) 2020 S.

Fruit flies are multistable geniuses	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; DROSOPHILA; MOTION; INSECT; SYSTEM; PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS; VISION; DESIGN; FLY	Our sensory systems have evolved to provide us with information about the external world. Such information is useful only insofar as it leads to actions that enhance fitness, and thus, the link between sensation and action has been thoroughly studied in many species. In insects, for example, specific visual stimuli lead to highly stereotyped responses. In contrast, humans can exhibit a wide range of responses to the same stimulus, as occurs most notably in the phenomenon of multistable perception. On this basis, one might think that humans have a fundamentally different way of generating actions from sensory inputs, but Toepfer et al. show that flies show evidence of multistable perception as well. Specifically, when confronted with a sensory stimulus that can yield different motor responses, flies switch from one response to another with temporal dynamics that are similar to those of humans and other animals. This suggests that the mechanisms that give rise to the rich repertoire of sensory experience in humans have correlates in much simpler nervous systems.

Public attitudes toward an authorization for contact program for clinical research	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						electronic health record; recruitment; clinical research		We conducted an online experimental survey to evaluate attitudes toward an authorization for contact (AFC) program allowing researchers to contact patients about studies based on electronic record review. A total of 1070 participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 flyers varying in design and framing. Participants were asked to select concerns about and reasons for signing up for AFC. Logistic regression and latent class analysis were conducted. The most commonly selected concerns included needing more information (43%), privacy (40%), and needing more time to think (28%). A minority were not interested in participating in research (16%) and did not want to be bothered (15%). Latent class analysis identified clusters with specific concerns about privacy, lack of interest in research, and not wanting to be bothered. A novel flyer with simple and positive framing was associated with lower odds of both not wanting to be bothered (P = .01) and not being interested in research (P = .01). Many concerns about AFC programs appear nonspecific. Addressing privacy, lack of interest in research, and not wanting to be bothered warrant further study as ways to enhance recruitment.

Local order parameter that distinguishes crystalline and amorphous portions in polymer crystal lamellae	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; SPHERULITES; MICROPLASTICS; POLYETHYLENE; DEFORMATION; NUCLEATION; GROWTH	The degradation of microplastics in relation to marine pollution has been receiving increasing attention. Because the spherulites that comprise microplastics have a highly ordered lamellar structure, their decomposition is thought to involve a lamellar structure collapse process. However, even in the simplest case of an order-disorder transition between lamellae and melt upon heating, the microscopic details of the transition have yet to be elucidated. In particular, it is unclear whether nucleation occurs at defects in the crystalline portion or at the interface between the crystalline and amorphous portions. To observe the transition in molecular simulations, an approach that distinguishes between the crystalline and amorphous structures that make up the lamella is needed. Local order parameters (LOPs) are an attempt to define the degree of order on a particle-by-particle basis and have demonstrated the ability to precisely render complex order structure transitions during phase transitions. In this study, 274 LOPs were considered to classify the crystalline and amorphous structures of polymers. Supervised machine learning was used to automatically and systematically search for the parameters. The identified optimal LOP does not require macroscopic information such as the overall orientation direction of the lamella layers but can precisely distinguish the crystalline and amorphous portions of the lamella layers using only a small amount of neighboring particle information.

The perceptual-motor task involved flying (or observing) a plane through a simulated Red Bull Air Race course in first person and third person chase perspective. The third person perspective is akin to remote operation of a vehicle. The ability for humans to remotely operate vehicles likely has its roots in neural processes related to imitation in which visuomotor transformation is necessary to interpret the action goals in an egocentric manner suitable for execution. In this experiment for 3rd person perspective the visuomotor transformation is dynamically changing in accordance to the orientation of the plane. It was predicted that 3rd person remote flying, over 1st, would utilize brain regions composing the 'Mirror Neuron' system that is thought to be intimately involved with imitation for both execution and observation tasks. Consistent with this prediction differential brain activity was present for 3rd person over 1st person perspectives for both execution and observation tasks in left ventral premotor cortex, right dorsal premotor cortex, and inferior parietal lobule bilaterally (Mirror Neuron System) (Behaviorally: 1st>3rd). These regions additionally showed greater activity for flying (execution) over watching (observation) conditions. Even though visual and motor aspects of the tasks were controlled for, differential activity was also found in brain regions involved with tool use, motion perception, and body perspective including left cerebellum, temporo-occipital regions, lateral occipital cortex, medial temporal region, and extrastriate body area. This experiment successfully demonstrates that a complex perceptual motor real-world task can be utilized to investigate visuomotor processing. This approach (Aviation Cerebral Experimental Sciences ACES) focusing on direct application to lab and field is in contrast to standard methodology in which tasks and conditions are reduced to their simplest forms that are remote from daily life experience.

To describe a teaching challenge intended to increase faculty use of evidence-based and student-centered instructional strategies in the demanding school of pharmacy context with technology-savvy students. Design. A teaching challenge was created that required faculty members to incorporate a "new-to-you" innovative teaching method in a class, course, or experiential activity. The method was linked to at least 1 of 7 evidence-based principles for effective teaching. Faculty members were exposed to colleagues' teaching strategies via brief voluntary presentations at department meetings. Assessment. A post-challenge survey provided assessment data about the challenge. Responses to a baseline survey provided additional information about what faculty members were already doing (52% response rate). Eighty-one percent of faculty respondents completed the challenge. A wide array of new strategies (13 categories such as flipped classrooms and social media) was implemented and 75% included the use of technology. Nearly all respondents (96%) thought that participation in the challenge was worth the effort and planned to participate again the following year. All faculty members intended to continue using their new strategy and 56% planned additional modifications with future implementations. The challenge demonstrated how multiple goals of curricular improvement, faculty development, and student-centered instruction could be achieved together. Conclusion. The teaching challenge motivated most of the faculty members to try something new to them. Links between evidence-based principles and day-to-day activities were strengthened. The new-to-you design placed the challenge within reach of faculty members regardless of their background, subject, or experience.	[Edwards, Roger A.; Kirwin, Jennifer; Gonyeau, Michael; Matthews, S.

Methods In a randomised, double-blinded, crossover design, 12 healthy males consumed either 30 or 60 mL of Montmorency tart cherry concentrate. Following analysis of the juice composition, venous blood samples were taken before and 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 h post-consumption of the beverage. In addition to examining some aspects of the concentrate contents, plasma concentrations of protocatechuic acid (PCA), vanillic acid (VA) and chlorogenic (CHL) acid were analysed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array for quantitation and mass spectrometry detection (LCMS) for qualitative purposes. Vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation were also assessed in vitro. Results Both the 30 and 60 mL doses of Montmorency cherry concentrate contained high amounts of total phenolics (71.37 +/- 0.11; 142.73 +/- 0.22 mg/L) and total anthocyanins (62.47 +/- 0.31; 31.24 +/- 0.16 mg/L), as well as large quantities of CHL (0.205 +/- 0.24; 0.410 +/- 0.48 mg/L) and VA (0.253 +/- 0.84; 0.506 +/- 1.68 mg/L). HPLC/LCMS identified two dihydroxybenzoic acids (PCA and VA) in plasma following MC concentrate consumption. Both compounds were most abundant 1-2 h post-initial ingestion with traces detectable at 8 h post-ingestion. Cell migration was significantly influenced by the combination of PCA and VA, but not in isolation. There was no effect of the compounds on cell proliferation. Conclusions These data show new information that phenolic compounds thought to exert vasoactive properties are bioavailable in vivo following MC consumption and subsequently can influence cell behaviour. These data may be useful for the design and interpretation of intervention studies investigating the health effects of Montmorency cherries.

J	Ellaway, R; Masters, K				Ellaway, Rachel; Masters, Ken			AMEE Guide 32: e-Learning in medical education - Part 1: Learning, teaching and assessment	MEDICAL TEACHER			English	Review							PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; HEALTH-SCIENCES; NEEDS; STUDENTS; CARE; COMMUNICATION; COMPUTERS; SURGEONS; ACCESS	In just a few years, e-learning has become part of the mainstream in medical education. While e-learning means many things to many people, at its heart it is concerned with the educational uses of technology. For the purposes of this guide, we consider the many ways that the information revolution has affected and remediated the practice of healthcare teaching and learning. Deploying new technologies usually introduces tensions, and e-learning is no exception. Some wish to use it merely to perform pre-existing activities more efficiently or faster. Others pursue new ways of thinking and working that the use of such technology affords them. Simultaneously, while education, not technology, is the prime goal (and for healthcare, better patient outcomes), we are also aware that we cannot always predict outcomes. Sometimes, we have to take risks, and 'see what happens.' Serendipity often adds to the excitement of teaching. It certainly adds to the excitement of learning. The use of technology in support of education is not, therefore, a causal or engineered set of practices; rather, it requires creativity and adaptability in response to the specific and changing contexts in which it is used. Medical Education, as with most fields, is grappling with these tensions; the AMEE Guide to e-Learning in Medical Education hopes to help the reader, whether novice or expert, navigate them. This Guide is presented both as an introduction to the novice, and as a resource to more experienced practitioners. It covers a wide range of topics, some in broad outline, and others in more detail. Each section is concluded with a brief 'Take Home Message' which serves as a short summary of the section. The Guide is divided into two parts. The first part introduces the basic concepts of e-learning, e-teaching, and e-assessment, and then focuses on the day-to-day issues of e-learning, looking both at theoretical concepts and practical implementation issues. The second part examines technical, management, social, design and other broader issues in e-learning, and it ends with a review of emerging forms and directions in e-learning in medical education.

Initially, this effect was thought to be due to the mismatch experienced during treadmill walking between the visual (absence of optic flow signaling body steadiness) and proprioceptive (muscle spindles firing signaling body displacement) information. Recently, the persistence of this effect has been shown even in the absence of vision, suggesting that other information, such as the sound of steps, could play a role. To test this hypothesis, six cochlear-implanted individuals were recruited and their forward drift was measured before (Control phase) and after (Post Exercise phase) walking on a treadmill while having their cochlear system turned on and turned off. The relevance in testing cochlear-implanted individuals was that when their system is turned off, they perceive total silence, even eliminating the sounds normally obtained from bone conduction. Results showed the absence of the aftereffect when the system was turned off, underlining the fundamental role played by sounds in the control of action and breaking new ground in the use of interactive sound feedback in motor learning and motor development.

Pathogens interact with their vectors at the organic and cellular levels, while the potential changes that may occur at the biochemical level are less well reported. In this study, the impact of CLso on the metabolism of PoP and the identification of biomarkers from infected psyllids were examined. Using ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis, metabolomic changes in CLso-infected psyllids were compared to uninfected ones. A total of 34 metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers of CLso infection, which were primarily related to amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism. The significant increase in glycerophospholipids is thought to be associated with CLso evading the insect vector's immune defense. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI) was used to map the spatial distribution of these biomarkers, revealing that 15-keto-Prostaglandin E2 and alpha-D-Glucose were highly expressed in the abdomen of uninfected psyllids but down-regulated in infected psyllids. It is speculated that this down-regulation may be due to CLso evading surveillance by immune suppression in the PoP midgut. Overall, valuable biochemical information was provided, a theoretical basis for a better understanding of psyllid-pathogen interactions was offered, and the findings may aid in breaking the transmission cycle of these diseases.

The "analysis of competing hypotheses" in intelligence analysis	APPLIED COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						confirmation bias; hypothesis testing; intelligence analysis; judgement and decision making	CONFIRMATION BIAS; INFORMATION; PROBABILITY; INSTRUCTION; JUDGMENT	The intelligence community uses "structured analytic techniques" to help analysts think critically and avoid cognitive bias. However, little evidence exists of how techniques are applied and whether they are effective. We examined the use of the analysis of competing hypotheses (ACH)-a technique designed to reduce "confirmation bias." Fifty intelligence analysts were randomly assigned to use ACH or not when completing a hypothesis testing task that had probabilistic ground truth. Data on analysts' judgement processes and conclusions were collected using written protocols that were then coded for statistical analyses. We found that ACH-trained analysts did not follow all of the steps of ACH. There was mixed evidence for ACH's ability to reduce confirmation bias, and we observed that ACH may increase judgement inconsistency and error. It may be prudent for the intelligence community to consider the conditions under which ACH would prove useful and to explore alternatives.

Our objective was to explore what depressed IPV survivors believe about the relationship between abuse, mental health, and physical symptoms and to elicit their recommendations for addressing depression. DESIGN: Focus group study. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Adult, English-speaking, female, Internal Medicine clinic patients with depressive symptoms and a history of IPV. INTERVENTIONS: Thematic analysis using an inductive approach (consistent with grounded theory), at a semantic level, with an essentialist paradigm. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty three women participated in 5 focus groups. Although selected because of their depression, participants often felt their greatest concerns were physical. They acknowledged that their abuse history, depression, and physical complaints compound each other. They appreciated the need for health care workers to know about their depression and IPV history to get a "full picture" of their health, but they were often hesitant to discuss such issues with providers because of their fear that such information would make providers think their symptoms were "all in their head" or would encourage providers to discount their pain. Participants discussed difficulties related to trust and control in relationships with providers and gave recommendations as to how providers can earn their trust. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding a patient's IPV history may allow providers to develop a better therapeutic relationship. To treat depression adequately, it is important for providers to reassure patients that they believe their physical symptoms; to communicate respect for patients' intelligence, experience, and complexity; and to share control.

Its enzymatic activity is thought to influence processes of synaptic plasticity, with its deregulation causing accelerated neuromuscular junction (NMJ) degeneration or contributing to forms of mental retardation. These biological effects are likely to stem from NT-based regulation of agrin signaling. However, dissecting the exact biological implications of NT-agrin interplay is difficult, due to the scarce molecular detail regarding NT activity and NT-agrin interactions. We developed a strategy to reliably produce and purify a catalytically competent engineered variant of NT called "NT-mini" and a library of C-terminal agrin fragments, with which we performed a thorough biochemical and biophysical characterization of NT enzyme functionality. We studied the regulatory effects of calcium ions and heparin, identified NT's heparin-binding domain, and discovered how zinc ions induce modulation of enzymatic activity. Additionally, we investigated myotube differentiation and hippocampal neuron excitability, evidencing a dose-dependent increase in neuronal activity alongside a negative impact on myoblast fusion when using the active NT enzyme. Collectively, our results provide in vitro and cellular foundations to unravel the molecular underpinnings and biological significance of NT-agrin interactions.

This paper targets the subset of end-user programmers (EUPs) in this category. We present a set of principles on how to help EUPs like this learn just a little when they need to overcome a barrier. We then instantiate the principles in a prototype and empirically investigate them in three studies: a formative think-aloud study, a pair of summer camps attended by 42 teens, and a third summer camp study featuring a different environment attended by 48 teens. Finally, we present a generalized architecture to facilitate the inclusion of Idea Gardens into other systems, illustrating with examples from Idea Garden prototypes. Results have been very encouraging. For example, under our principles, Study #2's camp participants required significantly less in-person help than in a previous camp to learn the same amount of material in the same amount of time.

The current studies examine this by investigating core visual processes that contribute to holistic processing namely, individuation and element grouping and how they develop in participants with autism and typically developing (TD) participants matched for age, IQ, and gender. Individuation refers to the ability to "see" approximately four elements simultaneously; grouping elements can modify how many elements can be individuated. We examined these processes using two well-established paradigms, rapid enumeration and multiple object tracking (MOT). In both tasks, a performance limit of four elements in typical adults is thought to reflect individuation capacity. Participants with autism displayed a smaller individuation capacity than TD controls, regardless of whether they were enumerating static elements or tracking moving ones. To manipulate the holistic information available via element grouping, elements were arranged into a design in rapid enumeration, or moved together in MOT. Performance in participants with autism was affected to a similar degree as TD participants by element grouping, whether the manipulation helped or hurt performance, consistent with evidence that some types of gestalt/grouping information are processed typically in autism. There was substantial development from childhood to adolescence in the speed of individuation in those with autism, but not from adolescence to adulthood, a pattern distinct from TD participants. These results reveal how core visual processes function in autism, and provide insight into the architecture of vision (i.e., individuation appears distinct from visual strengths in autism, such as visual search).

J	Sharp, RS				Sharp, RS			Some contemporary problems in road vehicle dynamics	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						road vehicle handling; human factors; man-machine systems; quality; prediction		It is argued that there is great commercial value in transferring as much of vehicle-handling qualities assessment as possible from the prototype testing domain to the predictive engineering domain. Man-machine system thinking is necessary to provide a firm basis for progress. Also, the newer opportunities in vehicle chassis engineering to introduce information enhancement and control intervention systems pose human factors problems. It is possible for such systems to do more harm than good. Some descriptions of conventional mixtures of prediction and testing are given and the driving activity is analysed. A conceptual framework involving the specification of vehicle characteristics, which contribute to the subjective judgements made by drivers, is set up. Examples in the categories are explained. The major chassis enhancement systems in production or in late development and their contributions in the various categories are discussed. Quality judgements are shown to be made by a very complex process, containing conflict and requiring very wide-ranging test conditions for the full picture to be revealed. It is considered that a conceptual classification, such as that put forward, is necessary to allow the design of research programmes which will yield fundamental, generic and practically useful results.

This study developed a web-based history educational system, which has used the acronym HES-SPATO (history educational system based on SPATO), to increase the under-standability of history learning materials. SPATO (spatial, person, action/attribute, and temporal object) was designed to integrate the indispensable elements of history events such as space, person, action/attribute, and time. HES-SPATO also applied temporal logic to reason the temporal relationships between history events. Furthermore, it employed the GIS concept of information layers to develop the student interface. The findings of the experiments indicated that the use of HES-SPATO was effective in enhancing students' history learning. The participants also showed positive attitudes toward the HES-SPATO system in terms of the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude to use, intention to use, recall of web sites, and perceived usefulness of assistant tools. Although many functionalities have been added to the HES-SPATO system, there was no significant difference in system efficiency between HES-SPATO and the comparative system. These experimental results also guide the direction of future research. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SIRT2 is composed of a central catalytic domain, the structure of which has been solved, and N- and C-terminal extensions that are thought to control SIRT2 function. However structural information of these N- and C-terminal regions is missing. Here, we provide the first full-length molecular models of SIRT2 in the absence and presence of NAD+. We also predict the structural alterations associated with phosphorylation of SIRT2 at S331, a modification that inhibits catalytic activity. Bioinformatics tools and molecular dynamics simulations, complemented by in vitro deacetylation assays, provide a consistent picture based on which the C-terminal region of SIRT2 is suggested to function as an autoinhibitory region. This has the capacity to partially occlude the NAD(+) binding pocket or stabilize the NAD(+) in a non-productive state. Furthermore, our simulations suggest that the phosphorylation at S331 causes large conformational changes in the C-terminal region that enhance the autoinhibitory activity, consistent with our previous findings that phosphorylation of S331 by cyclin-dependent kinases inhibits SIRT2 catalytic activity. The molecular insight into the role of the C-terminal region in controlling SIRT2 function described in this study may be useful for future design of selective inhibitors targeting SIRT2 for therapeutic applications.

Pharmaceutical excipients with potential to cause adverse effects in paediatric nasal medicines	REGULATORY TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Benzalkonium chloride; Adverse drug reactions; Dug labeling; Excipients; Nasal drugs; Pediatrics; Risk assessment	BENZALKONIUM CHLORIDE; SAFETY ASSESSMENT; FORMULATIONS; RHINITIS; AEROSOL; ACID	Some pharmaceutical excipients may cause adverse reactions, excipient-related interactions and/or contraindications. Due to the unique characteristics of the paediatric population, adverse effects may occur to substances generally thought safe. The proportion of topical nasal medicines approved for paediatric use and the prevalence and labelling of excipients with known effect (EKE) in these products were compared in Serbia as a non-EU country and Croatia and Slovenia as EU countries. The study was designed as a post-authorization safety study and safety of excipients was considered in accordance with recommendations of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). More than 90% of topical nasal medicines registered in the three countries were approved for paediatric use and more than half of these paediatric medicines contained EKE that may cause adverse effects. Benzalkonium chloride was found in 52.38%, 55.81% and 59.09% of these products in Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia, respectively. Propylene glycol, benzyl alcohol, ethanol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben and boric acid were also present in a few analysed preparations. A significant number of EKE labelling deficiencies were detected in all three countries, hindering healthcare professionals' access to information needed for adequate patient counselling. A revision of the nasal paediatric medicines' PLs and SmPCs is recommended.

Our objective in the current pilot study was to obtain preliminary information on the relationship between platelet collagen receptor density and prior MI. Material/Methods: We measured glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and integrin alpha 2 beta 1 density by flow cytometry using FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies in consecutive subjects from an outpatient cardiology practice. We used a case-control design to match 77 patients with prior MI to 77 control patients. Matching was performed on the basis of traditional risk factors for MI. Results: The mean GPVI density was 14% higher in those with prior MI (P=0.098), and the alpha 2 beta 1 density was 6% higher in those with prior MI (P=0.49). A GPVI or alpha 2 beta 1 density within the lowest decile was associated with a lower MI prevalence (OR=6.3, 95% CI: 1.3-29.2 P=0.009). Conclusions: Our preliminary data suggests that platelet collagen receptor density, when measured directly, may be related to prior myocardial infarction. An appropriately sized clinical study using this methodology is warranted to further investigate whether collagen receptor density serves as a novel risk factor for myocardial infarction.

Objective: To explore family caregivers' experience of involuntary admission of their relative. Method: 30 in-depth interviews were conducted with family caregivers of 29 patients who had been involuntarily admitted to 12 hospitals across England. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Four major themes of experiences were identified: relief and conflicting emotions in response to the relative's admission; frustration with a delay in getting help; being given the burden of care by services; and difficulties with confidentiality. Relief was a predominant emotion as a response to the relative's admission and it was accompanied by feelings of guilt and worry. Family caregivers frequently experienced difficulties in obtaining help from services prior to involuntary admission and some thought that services responded to crises rather than prevented them. Family caregivers experienced increased burden when services shifted the responsibility of caring for their mentally unwell relatives to them. Confidentiality was a delicate issue with family caregivers wanting more information and a say in decisions when they were responsible for aftercare, and being concerned about confidentiality of information they provided to services. Conclusion: Compulsory admission of a close relative can be a complex and stressful experience for family caregivers. In order for caregivers to be effective partners in care, a balance needs to be struck between valuing their involvement in providing care for a patient and not overburdening them.

J	Zhang, ZG; Zhang, Y; Wang, W				Zhang, Zhengguang; Zhang, Yu; Wang, Wei			Three-compartment structure of subsurface-intensified mesoscale eddies in the ocean	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article							SUBTROPICAL MODE WATER; NORTH-ATLANTIC OCEAN; INTRATHERMOCLINE EDDIES; IN-SITU; EDDY; SUBDUCTION; PACIFIC; WAVES; CHLOROPHYLL; CIRCULATION	Mesoscale eddies are energetically dominant and pervasive over most of the world's oceans. Among them, many are subsurface intensified with strongest signals in the ocean interior such as mode-water eddies, which trap water masses with distinctive properties and carry them over long distances. With both Argo profiling floats and atmospheric reanalysis data we showed that the structure of these eddies obeys a universal rule. Hence their three-dimensional hydrographic fields can be readily reconstructed from very limited information. More interestingly, the volume of water trapped and moved by a mode-water eddy is much greater than previously thought; it has a three-compartment structure in the vertical with the mode water being sandwiched between two layers of notably different properties and accounting for only a portion of the total trapped volume.

In this research, we investigate framing effects among domain experts, an understudied yet increasingly important set of individuals in the policymaking process. Because domain experts have extensive and highly structured knowledge on a particular topic, they are likely to actively process issue frames to which they are exposed. Consequently, we hypothesize that frames consistent with experts' values will be particularly influential, whereas frames inconsistent with their values will lead to contrast effects. We test our hypotheses on a unique set of domain experts by examining professional farmers' attitudes toward no-till agriculture. Using an experimental design, we find evidence that environmental values interact with frames to influence farmers' interest in no-till, especially when farmers are exposed to a novel frame.

The enzyme is thought to be part of the human defense mechanism against fungal parasites, but its precise role and the details of its enzymatic properties have not yet been fully unraveled. We have studied the properties of HCHT by analyzing how the enzyme acts on high-molecular weight chitosans, soluble copolymers of beta-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc, A), and glucosamine (GlcN, D). Using methods for in-depth studies of the chitinolytic machinery of bacterial family 18 enzymes, we show that HCHT degrades chitosan primarily via an endoprocessive mechanism, as would be expected on the basis of the structural features of its substrate-binding cleft. The preferences of HCHT subsites for acetylated versus nonacetylated sugars were assessed by sequence analysis of obtained oligomeric products showing a very strong, absolute, and a relative weak preference for an acetylated unit in the -2, -1, and +1 subsites, respectively. The latter information is important for the design of inhibitors that are specific for the human chitinases and also provides insight into what kind of products may be formed in vivo upon administration of chitosan-containing medicines or food products.

Matrine, a reactive and bioactive alkaloid found in a Chinese herb medicine from the genus Sophora, was used to synthesize a novel family of matrinium-based room temperature ILs, featuring a series of long-chain fatty acid anions derived from vegetable oils. The prepared ILs exhibited superb physicochemical properties, including relatively low viscosities (325.5-489.5 m Pas), moderate densities (100-1.07 g cm(-3)), and wide liquid operating ranges (230-270 degrees C). Solvatochromic experiments showed that the dipolarity/ polarizability (pi*) values (0.67-0.78) of these ILs were far below those of most common ILs, suggesting promising application potential as solvents for lipophilic compounds. Furthermore, the prepared ILs were shown to have better antibacterial and anticancer activities than matrine, while elongation of the alkanoate anions strongly enhanced their bioactivities. Additionally, the prepared ILs demonstrated relatively lower cytotoxicity on normal cells (L929) compared to tumor cells (HeLa and A549). Consequently, the bio-renewable matrinium-based ILs should have potential applications as benign solvents for use in chemistry, biology, pharmacy, etc. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The RCDI was designed based upon analyses of qualitative data collected in semi-structured interviews with general chemistry students or organic chemistry students to ensure all items and distractors were grounded in students' ideas and reasoning. A longitudinal, multi-institution research study was conducted using the RCDI to measure changes in undergraduate chemistry students' reasoning with RCDs, and their confidence in doing so, at three points in time: (1) end of second-semester general chemistry, (2) beginning of first-semester organic chemistry, and (3) end of first-semester organic chemistry. The three institutions participating in this longitudinal study taught organic chemistry using either a traditional functional group curriculum or a mechanisms approach. Findings include evidence that individual students performed significantly better with significantly higher confidence as they progressed through courses, but that some RCD misconceptions, such as incorrectly assuming reaction progress indicates a time unit, are persistent throughout. Although two of the institutions taught organic chemistry using a mechanisms curriculum and one institution used the traditional functional group approach, no evidence exists of significant differences among students' RCDI total score and average confidence across institutions.Y	[Atkinson, Molly B.] Univ North Texas, Dept Chem, Denton, TX 76209 USA; [Bretz, Stacey Lowery] Miami Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Oxford, OH 45056 USA	University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; University System of Ohio; Miami University	Bretz, SL (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.	bretzsl@miamioh.edu	Bretz, Stacey Lowery/IVU-7884-2023	Bretz, Stacey Lowery/0000-0001-5503-8987; Atkinson, Molly/0000-0002-4387-8556	National Science Foundation [1432466]; Division Of Undergraduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1432466] Funding Source: National Science Foundation	National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Undergraduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU))	This research is based in part upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Award Number 1432466.

However, there is limited information about encountered difficulties in dealing with MH among Chinese anesthesiologists. The purpose of the study was to explore the current competency and encountered difficulties in the management of MH, as a key first step for assessing the potential user needs to develop the MH-NRES.Methods: The hospitals of different levels in different provinces across China were invited to participate in an online survey from November to December 2021. Anesthesiologists completed the online questionnaire containing four sections including demographic information, knowledge, competency, and continuing education about MH.Results: A total of 1357 valid questionnaires were completed from anesthesiologists, most respondents (66.7%, n = 905) correctly answered the MH trigger drugs included volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine. However, most respondents (77.0%, n = 1045) did not know that the recommended initial dose of domestic dantrolene. Up to 83.9% (n = 1138) stated that their hospitals did not store dantrolene for MH emergency. More than half of respondents thought that it would take more than one hour to obtain dantrolene in emergency. Less work experiences, lower levels of hospital and educations and professional titles were associated with lower competency scores in managing MH. Only 31.0% (n = 936) reported that their hospital had ever conducted MH continuing education curricula. Scenario simulation is the training method that most interests the participants (79.0%, n = 1072) but a whopping 46.9% (n = 637) never received simulation.Conclusion: The study indicated that difficulty in obtaining dantrolene, lack of competency in management of MH, difficulty in obtaining professional help, and poor teamwork were the main problems of most anesthesiologists in face of MH.

Design/methodology/approachSecondary data are collected from Chinese A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2018. The authors propose an econometric model focusing on the impact of ITIs on a firm's market value and profit. A propensity score matching model is applied to control endogeneity. FindingsThe ITIs' effect on FP is found to be completely mediated by digital options, and the reach of digital options plays a more positive role in the relationship between ITIs and Tobin's Q, whereas the richness of digital options is stronger between ITIs and return on net assets (ROE). The group study shows that the impact of process technologies such as cloud computing and the Internet of Things has a more profound impact on Tobin's Q, and the knowledge technologies represented by artificial intelligence, blockchain and big data strongly affect ROE. In addition, the positive relationship between ITIs and FP is unrelated to IT/non-IT firms. Research limitations/implicationsFirst, the data are based on 219 publicly announced emerging ITIs in China and thus may not be generalizable to other cultural/national contexts. Second, there is a lack of a large sample data set of emerging ITI information in China, and the duration of this study is constrained to the relatively short rise of emerging technologies. Practical implicationsThis study provides firm decision-makers with practical implications. The results imply that the effect of ITIs on FP depends on digital options, so both IT firms (e.g., Big Tech giants) and non-IT firms (e.g., incumbents) should discover how to balance firm value and profit in their management of emerging technology investment projects with digital options thinking. Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first empirical study to investigate the relationship between ITIs and FP from the perspective of digital options, exploring five emerging technologies and considering firm life, size, and state ownership in a sample of Chinese listed firms.

J	Mackavey, C; Cron, S				Mackavey, Carole; Cron, Stan			Innovative strategies: Increased engagement and synthesis in online advanced practice nursing education	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Article						Gamification; Engagement; Online education; Case-based learning	PERSPECTIVES	Introduction: The struggle to maintain quality education in the online environment has brought about the redesign for the family nurse practitioner courses. Background: The family nurse practitioner program uses graduate Health Education Systems Incorporated examination as a quality indicator and program benchmark. A downward trend in Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores stimulated a need for change. Two strategies were implemented to enhance engagement and improve synthesis of clinical information. Case-based learning and gamification involves the use of game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to engage users in solving problems while the case-based discussions act as formative assessment tool, providing information on student's progress and development. Objectives: To assess the implementation of innovative strategies on the Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores and to enhance students engagement and synthesis of clinical information. Method: Case presentations were created in the Learning Management System an online program, for every module. Interwoven throughout the module are various game elements. The game elements include voluntary participation with immediate feedback that can be both positive and negative and provides a social connection. The student has the freedom to fail and the freedom to choose without significant repercussions. Results: The results showed examination scores increased significantly. Using a one-way analysis of variance to compare Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores between semester cohorts of students, followed by a post hoc pairwise comparison a statistically significant difference (p < .001) between previous semesters was identified. Conclusion: Although there are many approaches for online learning, using case presentations can mirror different social and cultural situations to challenge the learner. Case-based discussion and gamification strategies are effective in engaging students in a challenging environment. Student responded positively to case-base presentation with game elements. Using this approach is designed to challenge and add value to the learning experience.

The LifeStories project: Empowering voices and avoiding harm-Ethics protocol of a long-term follow-up study of individuals placed in infant care institutions in Switzerland	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						ethics; vulnerable cohort; long-term follow-up; institutionalization; deprivation	RESEARCH PARTICIPATION; BEREAVED PARENTS; POPULATION; EXPERIENCE; DISTRESS; BENEFITS; ASKING; HEALTH; RISKS	Little empirical data exist to guide ethical decisions when conducting research with vulnerable populations. The current study assesses a protocol designed to mitigate risks in a population-based cohort of 246 individuals placed in care institutions as infants in a non-selective 60-year follow-up. In total, 116 (47%) individuals chose to participate, of whom 53 (55%) reported positive effects of participation such as the opportunity to fill some gaps in their life stories, to better deal with their past, and to understand previous family dynamics. Only three individuals (2.5%) explicitly reported negative short-term consequences such as feeling upset as a result of thinking about stressful times, but they nonetheless rated the usefulness of the study as high. For six participants (5%), psychological counseling sessions were initiated as a support measure. Our findings suggest that risk of harm can be managed with a rigorous ethics protocol when conducting research with a vulnerable cohort and therefore enable the voices of survivors to be heard. A step wise approach in which increasing amounts of information were presented at each step, clearly operationalized passive decline, and direct and consistent contact with highly trained staff were considered key to mitigating distress.

GATE is one of the most widely used systems of its type with yearly download rates of tens of thousands and many active users in both academic and industrial contexts. In this paper we report three examples of GATE-based systems operating in the life sciences and in medicine. First, in genome-wide association studies which have contributed to discovery of a head and neck cancer mutation association. Second, medical records analysis which has significantly increased the statistical power of treatment/outcome models in the UK's largest psychiatric patient cohort. Third, richer constructs in drug-related searching. We also explore the ways in which the GATE family supports the various stages of the lifecycle present in our examples. We conclude that the deployment of text mining for document abstraction or rich search and navigation is best thought of as a process, and that with the right computational tools and data collection strategies this process can be made defined and repeatable. The GATE research programme is now 20 years old and has grown from its roots as a specialist development tool for text processing to become a rather comprehensive ecosystem, bringing together software developers, language engineers and research staff from diverse fields. GATE now has a strong claim to cover a uniquely wide range of the lifecycle of text analysis systems. It forms a focal point for the integration and reuse of advances that have been made by many people (the majority outside of the authors' own group) who work in text processing for biomedicine and other areas. GATE is available online < 1 > under GNU open source licences and runs on all major operating systems. Support is available from an active user and developer community and also on a commercial basis.

J	Gugnani, S; Kashyap, A; Lu, XY				Gugnani, Shashank; Kashyap, Arjun; Lu, Xiaoyi			Understanding the Idiosyncrasies of Real Persistent Memory	PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT			English	Article							SYSTEM	High capacity persistent memory (PMEM) is finally commercially available in the form of Intel's Optane DC Persistent Memory Module (DCPMM). Researchers have raced to evaluate and understand the performance of DCPMM itself as well as systems and applications designed to leverage PMEM resulting from over a decade of research. Early evaluations of DCPMM show that its behavior is more nuanced and idiosyncratic than previously thought. Several assumptions made about its performance that guided the design of PMEM-enabled systems have been shown to be incorrect. Unfortunately, several peculiar performance characteristics of DCPMM are related to the memory technology (3D-XPoint) used and its internal architecture. It is expected that other technologies (such as STT-RAM, memristor, ReRAM, NVDIMM), with highly variable characteristics, will be commercially shipped as PMEM in the near future. Current evaluation studies fail to understand and categorize the idiosyncratic behavior of PMEM; i.e., how do the peculiarities of DCPMM related to other classes of PMEM. Clearly, there is a need for a study which can guide the design of systems and is agnostic to PMEM technology and internal architecture. In this paper, we first list and categorize the idiosyncratic behavior of PMEM by performing targeted experiments with our proposed PMIdioBench benchmark suite on a real DCPMM platform. Next, we conduct detailed studies to guide the design of storage systems, considering generic PMEM characteristics. The first study guides data placement on NUMA systems with PMEM while the second study guides the design of lock-free data structures, for both eADR- and ADR-enabled PMEM systems. Our results are often counter-intuitive and highlight the challenges of system design with PMEM.

The acceptability and feasibility of a randomised trial exploring approaches to managing impacted fetal head during emergency caesarean section: a qualitative study	BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH			English	Article						Impacted fetal head; Caesarean section; Second stage delivery; Obstetric complications; Randomised controlled trials; RCT	FULL CERVICAL DILATATION; DELIVERY	BackgroundCaesarean sections (CS) account for 26% of all births in the UK, of which at least 5% are done at full dilatation, in the second stage of labour. Second stage CS may be complicated by the fetal head being deeply impacted in the maternal pelvis, requiring specialist skills to achieve a safe birth. Numerous techniques are used to manage impacted fetal head, however, there are no national clinical guidelines in the UK.AimTo explore health professionals' and women's views on the acceptability and feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) designed to explore approaches to managing an impacted fetal head during emergency CS.MethodsSemi-structured interviews with 10 obstetricians and 16 women (6 pregnant and 10 who experienced an emergency second stage CS). Interviews were transcribed and analysed using systematic thematic analysis.ResultsThe findings considered the time at which you obtain consent, how and when information about the RCT is presented, and barriers and facilitators to recruiting health professionals and women into the RCT. Obstetricians emphasised the importance of training in the techniques, as well as the potential conflict between the RCT protocol and current site or individual practices. Women said they would trust health professionals' to use the most appropriate technique and abandon the RCT protocol if necessary. Similarly, obstetricians raised the tension between the RCT protocol versus safety in reverting to what they knew under emergency situations. Both groups reflected on how this might affect the authenticity of the results. A range of important maternal, infant and clinical outcomes were raised by women and obstetricians. However, there were varying views on which of the two RCT designs presented to participants would be preferred. Most participants thought the RCT would be feasible and acceptable.ConclusionsThis study suggests an RCT designed to evaluate different techniques for managing an impacted fetal head would be feasible and acceptable. However, it also identified a number of challenges that need to be considered when designing such an RCT. Results can be used to inform the design of RCTs in this area.

Here, I will review data that suggest that the amygdala is involved in several processes linked to determining what a stimulus is and what the organism should therefore do - the two questions that are part of the title. This piece will focus on three main aspects of amygdala function, namely attention, value representation, and decision making, by reviewing both non-human and human data. Two mechanisms of affective attention will be described. The first involves projections from the central nucleus of the amygdala to the basal forebrain, which has extensive and diffuse projections throughout the cortical mantle. The second involves projections from the basal amygdala to multiple levels across the visual cortex. I will also describe how the basolateral amygdala is important for the representation of value and in decision making. Overall, it will be argued that the amygdala plays a key role in solving the following problem: How can a limited-capacity information processing system that receives a constant stream of diverse inputs be designed to selectively process those inputs that are most significant to the objectives of the system? "What is it?" and "What's to be done?" processes can then be viewed as important building blocks in the construction of emotion, a process that is intertwined with cognition. Furthermore, answering the two questions directs how resources should be mobilized as the organism seeks out additional information from the environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Patients with rheumatic diseases (RDs) are vulnerable to the COVID-19 infection, given their immunocompromised status. Ensuring acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine is important and has attracted attention by health professionals. In this study, we designed an online cross-sectional survey that used an online questionnaire from 8 May 2021 to 4 October 2021. Attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccination, personal information, current disease activity status, adverse events (AEs), and knowledge sources of vaccines were collected. Descriptive statistics, nonparametric tests, and ordinal logistic regression were used to analyze the data. A total of 1022 questionnaires were received, among which 70.2% (720/1022) of patients with RDs agreed to vaccination, while only 31.6% of patients were actually vaccinated. Male, employed, high-income patients and those with inactive disease showed a more positive attitude. Concerns of AEs and disease flare were the main factors affecting vaccination willingness. Only 29.6% (304/1022) of patients thought they had received enough information about the COVID-19 vaccine from their doctors. In conclusion, most patients with RDs in China intended to get vaccinated, although the vaccination rate in this particular population was low. Rheumatologists should take more responsibility in COVID-19 vaccination education of patients with RDs.

However, HFA questionnaires are typically quantitative and lack depth to understand systems in which health facilities operate-crucial to designing context-oriented interventions. We report lessons from a multiple embedded case study exploring the experiences of HFA data collectors in implementing a novel HFA tool developed using systems thinking approach. We assessed 16 hospitals in four countries (Benin, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda) as part of a quality improvement implementation research. Our tool was organized in 17 sections and included dimensions of hospital governance, leadership and financing; maternity care standards and procedures; ongoing quality improvement practices; interactions with communities and mapping of the areas related to maternal care. Data for this study were collected using in-depth interviews with senior experts who conducted the HFA in the countries 1-3 months after completion of the HFAs. Data were analysed using the inductive thematic analysis approach. Our HFA faced challenges in logistics (accessing key hospital-based respondents, high turnover of managerial staff and difficulty accessing information considered sensitive in the context) and methodology (response bias, lack of data quality and data entry into an electronic platform). Data elements of governance, leadership and financing were the most affected. Opportunities and strategies adopted aimed at enhancing data collection (building on prior partnerships and understanding local and institutional bureaucracies) and enhancing data richness (identifying respondents with institutional memory, learning from experience and conducting observations at various times). Moreover, HFA data collectors conducted abstraction of records and interviews in a flexible and adaptive way to enhance data quality. Lessons and new skills learned from our HFA could be used as inputs to respond to the growing need of integrating the systems thinking approach in HFA to improve the contextual understanding of operations and structure.

J	Hindmarch, T; Dalrymple, J; Smith, M; Barclay, S				Hindmarch, Thomas; Dalrymple, James; Smith, Matthew; Barclay, Stephen			Spiritual interventions for cancer pain: a systematic review and narrative synthesis	BMJ SUPPORTIVE & PALLIATIVE CARE			English	Review						spiritual care; cancer; pain; terminal care	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; DIGNITY THERAPY; PALLIATIVE CARE; QUALITY; END; DISTRESS; OUTCOMES; SUPPORT	Background Pain is a common and debilitating cancer-related symptom. In palliative care, physical, psychological, social and spiritual factors are thought to contribute to individual experience of pain. Consequently, spiritual care interventions are advocated in the management of cancer-related pain. Aim To systematically review the published literature concerning spiritual interventions in the management of cancer-related pain. Methodology Seven databases (Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science) were searched for quantitative studies of pain in patients with cancer receiving spiritual care interventions, with additional reference and citation searches. Research quality and relevance was appraised using Gough's 'Weight of Evidence' framework prior to narrative synthesis. Results The search identified 12 822 articles, of which 11 were included in the synthesis. Few studies have investigated spiritual interventions in the management of cancer pain: a minority of these demonstrate statistical benefit. Some evidence suggests spiritual care may aid in coping with pain, rather than altering pain intensity. Spiritual interventions are well received by patients with cancer and do not appear to cause harm. Conclusion Current evidence provides limited support for the use of spiritual care interventions in the management of cancer pain. The paucity and heterogeneity of literature points to a need for high-quality research with judgements of spiritual intervention efficacy made on an individual basis.

Design: Deliberative polling. Setting: Three rural and three urban communities selected from the 32 areas covered by a district health council in Ontario. Participants: A total of 280 citizens from five potential decision-making groups: randomly selected citizens, attendees at town-hall meetings, appointees to district health councils, elected officials and experts in health care and social services. Intervention: Participants' opinions were polled during 29 structured 2-hour meetings. Main outcome measures: Participants' opinions on their personal willingness and their group's suitability to be involved in devolved decision making, desired type of decision-making involvement, information preferences, preferred areas of decision-making involvement and preferred composition of decisionmaking bodies. Results: Mean attendance at each meeting was 9.6 citizens. Although there were some significant differences in opinion among the five potential decision-making groups, there were few differences among citizens From different geographic areas. A total of 189 (72%) of people polled were personally willing to take on a role involving responsibility for overall decision-making, but far Fewer thought that their group was suited to taking on responsibility (30%) or a consulting role (55%). Elected officials were the most willing (85% personally willing, 50% thought their group was suitable) and randomly selected citizens the least willing (60% personally willing, 17% thought their group was suitable) to take responsibility for overall decision making. Most citizens polled indicated less interest in involvement in specific types of decisions, except for planning and setting priorities, than in overall decision making. Only 24 participants (9%) rated their own group as suitable to take responsibility for raising revenue, 91 (33%) deemed their group suited to distribution of funds and 108 (39%) felt their group was suitable for management of services. People in all five groups ranked health care needs (mean rank 1.5 out of four options) as the most important and preferences (mean rank 3.6) as the least important information. They rated a combination body involving several community groups as the most suitable overall decisionmaking body (8.8 on 10-point scale). Participants favoured the representation of elected officials, the provincial government and experts on combination bodies responsible for the specific types of decisions. Overall, as the complexity of devolved decision making became clear, participants tended to assign authority to traditional decision makers such as elected officials, experts and the provincial government, but also favoured a consulting role for attendees at town-hall meetings (i.e., interested citizens). Conclusion: There are significant differences among groups in the community in their willingness to be involved, desired roles and representation in devolved decision making on health care and social services in Ontario.

Design Cross sectional survey. Setting United States. Participants 479 women aged 18-97 years who did not report a history of breast cancer. Main outcome measures Attitudes to and knowledge of false positive results and the detection of ductal carcinoma in situ after screening mammography. Results Women were aware that false positive results do occur. Their median estimate of the false positive rate for 10 years of annual screening was 20% (25th percentile estimate, 10%; 75th percentile estimate, 45%). The women were highly tolerant of false positives: 63% thought that 500 or more false positives per life saved was reasonable and 37% would tolerate 10 000 or more. Women who had had a false positive result (n=76) expressed the same high tolerance: 39% would tolerate 10 000 or more false positives. 62% of women did not want to take false positive results into account when deciding about screening. Only 8% of women thought that mammography could harm a woman without breast cancer, and 94% doubted the possibility of non-progressive breast cancers. Few had heard about ductal carcinoma in situ, a cancer that may not progress, but when informed, 60% of women wanted to take into account the possibility of it being detected when deciding about screening. Conclusions Women are aware of false positives and seem to view them as an acceptable consequence of screening mammography. In contrast, most women are unaware that screening can detect cancers that may never progress but feel that such information would be relevant Education should perhaps focus less on false positives and more on the less familiar outcome of detection of ductal carcinoma in situ.

J	Tibély, G; Pollner, P; Palla, G				Tibely, Gergely; Pollner, Peter; Palla, Gergely			Comparing the hierarchy of author given tags and repository given tags in a large document archive	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS			English	Article							DYNAMICS	Folksonomies - large databases arising from collaborative tagging of items by independent users - are becoming an increasingly important way of categorizing information. In these systems users can tag items with free words, resulting in a tripartite item-tag-user network. Although there are no prescribed relations between tags, the way users think about the different categories presumably has some built in hierarchy, in which more special concepts are descendants of some more general categories. Several applications would benefit from the knowledge of this hierarchy. Here we apply a recent method to check the differences and similarities of hierarchies resulting from tags given by independent individuals and from tags given by a centrally managed repository system. The results from our method showed substantial differences between the lower part of the hierarchies, and in contrast, a relatively high similarity at the top of the hierarchies.

Study design: A diverse group of adults attended the presentations and completed a presurvey and postsurvey containing 10 knowledge questions, 3 opinion questions, and demographics. Results: Survey forms were completed by 3661 participants before and 3605 participants after 62 educational programs during the 2002 to 2003 school year. Adult participants consisted of school employees, adults attending parent presentations, health care professionals, adults at community presentations, and teachers. Presurveys revealed a significant lack of information by all groups, with health care professionals answering 37.9% and other adults answering 30.2% correct. All groups demonstrated significant (P = .0005) improvements in knowledge and a shift in attitude, favoring the delay of sexual activity until at least after high school from 94% before the survey to 98% after the survey (P < .0001) and the delay until marriage from 77% to 91.5% (P < .0001). Conclusion: Educating adults on the ramifications of adolescent sexual activity results in significant increases in knowledge and the proportion who think teens should delay sexual activity.

This study aimed to develop a decision aid (DA) to help older adults and their families choose the place of post-discharge care based on their values. Methods: Values and data for designing the DA were obtained through interviews with older stroke patients and their families, a questionnaire survey of various health professionals, and a review of patients' medical records. Next, a prototypic DA was prepared and tested for comprehensibility and usability using the 12-item International Patient Decision Aid Standards instrument. Results: The DA was developed based on the following 6 values that were common among older stroke patients and their families: "activities of daily living," "services and fees," "emergencies," "family support," "environment," and "home renovation." The prototype met the criteria in the comprehensibility and usability tests. Conclusion: Older stroke patients can use the DA to think through the evidence-based information matching their own values to make a more satisfactory decision. The effectiveness of this DA should further be investigated in clinical settings.

We dissect critical molecular events associated with phase separation of an intrinsically disordered prion-like low-complexity domain of Fused in Sarcoma by performing single-molecule studies permitting us to access the wealth of molecular information that is skewed in conventional ensemble experiments. Our single-molecule FRET experiments reveal the coexistence of two conformationally distinct subpopulations in the monomeric form. Single-droplet single-molecule FRET studies coupled with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, picosecond time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, and vibrational Raman spectroscopy indicate that structural unwinding switches intramolecular interactions into intermolecular contacts allowing the formation of a dynamic network within condensates. A disease-related mutation introduces enhanced structural plasticity engendering greater interchain interactions that can accelerate pathological aggregation. Our findings provide key mechanistic underpinnings of sequence-encoded dynamically-controlled structural unzipping resulting in biological phase separation. Using single-molecule FRET, the authors discover hidden structural subpopulations of the intrinsically disordered prion-like low-complexity domain of FUS and dissect key molecular events that drive dynamic network formation during phase separation.

Conventional electronic sensors and controllers are commonly, sometimes augmented by recent advances in soft electronics. Organic electronics and bioelectronics, especially with living substrates, offer a great opportunity to incorporate parallel sensing and information processing capabilities of natural systems into future and emerging wearables. Nowadays fungi are emerging as a promising candidate to produce sustainable textiles to be used as ecofriendly biowearables. To assess the sensing potential of fungal wearables we undertook laboratory experiments on electrical response of a hemp fabric colonised by oyster fungi Pleurotus ostreatus to mechanical stretching and stimulation with attractants and repellents. We have shown that it is possible to discern a nature of stimuli from the fungi electrical responses. The results paved a way towards future design of intelligent sensing patches to be used in reactive fungal wearables.

In the case of hydrocolloids urea addition is thought to impact gelation. Detailed information about its pertinent role on influencing the structure-function relationships of hydrocolloids is still elusive, however. The present investigation is aimed at delineating hydrocolloids structural behavior in the presence of urea employing iota-carrageenan as a model system. X-ray fiber diffraction, rheological and thermal properties of two iota-carrageenan solutions with weight concentrations 4.5 and 6.0% (w/w) at two urea molar concentrations (0.5 and 2.0 M) with and without heat treatments have been analyzed. X-ray results suggest that the canonical double helical structural arrangement of iota-carrageenan is maintained even after urea addition. However, improved crystallinity, ordering and altered unit cell dimensions especially with heat treatments of the binary mixtures indicate the promotion of favorable interactions among carrageenan helices in the presence of urea. Increased elastic modulus and onset temperature of melting endotherm with the heat treatment compared to cold addition further attests the X-ray observations of enhanced structural ordering. Overall, results suggest that urea molecules synergistically aid iota-carrageenan interactions and stabilize structure of junction zones. Our findings are deemed to be helpful in the design and development of novel non-food applications of hydrocolloids. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Theory and Experimental Evidence	POLITICAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY			English	Article						deliberative minipublic; deliberative democracy; deliberative poll; partisan cues	MINI-PUBLICS; INFORMATION; CALIFORNIA; ELECTIONS; REFORM; POLL	Deliberative minipublics are small groups of citizens who deliberate together about a policy issue and convey their conclusions to decision makers. Theorists have argued that deliberative minipublics can give observers evidence about counterfactual, enlightened public opinionwhat the people would think about an issue if they had the opportunity to deliberate with their fellow citizens. If the conclusions of a deliberative minipublic are received in this spirit and members of the public revise their opinions upon learning them, then deliberative minipublics could be a means of bringing actual public opinion into closer conformity with counterfactual, enlightened public opinion. We formalize a model of this theory and report the results of a survey experiment designed to test its predictions. The experiment produced evidence that learning the conclusions of a deliberative minipublic influenced respondents' policy opinions, bringing them into closer conformity with the opinions of the participants in the deliberative minipublic.

J	Simsek, HG; Erkin, Ö				Simsek, Hatice Gurgen; Erkin, Ozum			Sustainable development awareness and related factors in nursing students: A correlational descriptive study	NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE			English	Article						Awareness; Nursing student; Sustainable development	EDUCATION	Aim: To determine the sustainable development awareness and related factors in nursing students. Background: Sustainable Development Goals have an important place in nursing education. While the Sustainable Development Goals set out the determinants of health, they also provide guidance to nurses for their in-terventions. In this respect, it is important to determine the awareness of nursing students and to address this issue in nursing education. Design: Correlational descriptive study. Methods: A total of 199 Turkish nursing students were included in the study. Data were collected online through Google Forms between March and June 2021 by the demographic characteristics form and "Sustainable Development Awareness Scale ". Results: The mean age of the nursing students in the study was 20.18 ( & PLUSMN; 1.27) years. Students' mean score from the scale was 164.41 ( & PLUSMN; 15.13) points. While 63.8 % of the participants stated not hearing of the sustainable development concept before and 77.4 % of them did not know about Sustainable Development Goals. The social sustainability, environmental sustainability and total scale scores were determined to show significant differences between the genders and female participants got higher scores compared with males. Participants over the age of twenty were found to score significantly higher in the environmental sustainability sub-dimension. Ac-cording to the status of thinking that there is a relationship between sustainable development and nursing, the environmental sustainability scores of the students were found to differ statistically. According to the status of wanting to get more information about Sustainable Development Goals, the economic sustainability, environ-mental sustainability and total scale scores of the students were found to show a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The sustainable development awareness levels of nursing students were found to be higher than the average. While more than half of the participants stated not hearing of the sustainable development concept before and three quarters of them did not know about Sustainable Development Goals. In this study, the scale total or sub-dimension scores were found to show significant differences according to gender, age, the status of thinking that there is a relationship between sustainable development and nursing and the status of wanting to get more information about Sustainable Development Goals. To mobilize future nurses, it can be suggested that SDGs be added to the curriculum, considering their knowledge and willingness.

Your goal is to improve the user experience during your interaction with the website. Currently, there are many guidelines and recommendations whose objective is to enhance the user experience. But no standard or list includes these recommendations in a single guide. Usability, unlike accessibility, can be more intuitive. Because the developers themselves are in turn users and can use intuition during the development of websites. One can think that there is an innate behavior during the use of the usability guidelines and that therefore a user guide is not necessary. This research aims: 1) to collect all the usability guidelines and define their objectives. 2) seeks to find out if there is indeed an innate behavior of developers when they apply these guidelines. This research presents usability guidelines compiled and classified into five groups: (1) Recommendations to reduce "noise" (2) Follow conventions (3) Give information quickly and comprehensible (4) Efficient and understandable controls for users to enter information (5) Give answers descriptive and understandable to the actions of the users The purpose of the work is to analyze the recommendations (4) Data entry, efficient and understandable controls for users to enter information. To analyze this objective, the behavior of 20 web developers without training or experience in usability is studied. The experiment aims to reach conclusions about whether there is innate behavior on the part of IT engineers. Or if they need specific training. The objectives are: 1) to know which recommendations are the most forgotten by web developers. 2) to see the importance of the recommendations, in web developers view.

Aim: To explore the view of people in the early stage of dementia on planning for future care. Research design: The study is a qualitative interview study with a semistructured interview guide. The data were analyzed according to the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven. Participants and research context: Dementia nurses assisted in the recruiting of people with dementia for participation in the study. Study information was mailed to 95 people with early stage dementia. Ten people with dementia and eight caregiver spouses participated in the study. Ethical considerations: People with dementia belong to a vulnerable patient group, and care was taken in the areas of informed consent and accessible information. Findings: The views of people with dementia are characterized by a complex storyline involving tensions and movement within the themes of wants, beliefs, and levels of insight. Participants wanted to think about the future but also wanted to live in the here and now. Discussion: High demands are placed on the advance care planning process for people with dementia and their family caregivers. A dignity-enhancing approach in dementia care emphasizes the dignity of and respect for this vulnerable and care-dependent patient group. Conclusion: The process of advance care planning in dementia care needs to go beyond person-centered care to a relationship-centered process. The illness trajectory and the impact on autonomy need to be taken into consideration.

Here, we broaden the scope and depth of previous investigations by considering how DWMs responded to an ongoing pandemic after the initial shock. Our dataset contains listings from 194 DWMs collected until July 2021. We start by focusing on vaccines. We find 248 listings offering approved vaccines, like Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca, as well as vendors offering fabricated proofs of vaccination and COVID-19 passports. Then, we consider COVID-19 related products. We show that, as the regular economy has become able to satisfy the demand of these goods, DWMs have decreased their offer. Next, we analyse the profile of vendors of COVID-19 related products and vaccines. We find that most of them are specialized in a single type of listings and are willing to ship worldwide. Finally, we consider a broader set of listings mentioning COVID-19, in order to assess the general impact of the pandemic on the broader activity of DWMs. Among 10,330 such listings, we show that recreational drugs are the most affected among traditional DWMs product, with COVID-19 mentions steadily increasing since March 2020. We anticipate that our results will be of interest to researchers, practitioners, and law enforcement agencies focused on the study and safeguard of public health.

J	Ammar, N; Shaban-Nejad, A				Ammar, Nariman; Shaban-Nejad, Arash			Explainable Artificial Intelligence Recommendation System by Leveraging the Semantics of Adverse Childhood Experiences: Proof-of-Concept Prototype Development	JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						mental health surveillance; semantic web; knowledge-based recommendation; digital assistant; explainable artificial intelligence; adverse childhood experiences		Background: The study of adverse childhood experiences and their consequences has emerged over the past 20 years. Although the conclusions from these studies are available, the same is not true of the data. Accordingly, it is a complex problem to build a training set and develop machine-learning models from these studies. Classic machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques cannot provide a full scientific understanding of the inner workings of the underlying models. This raises credibility issues due to the lack of transparency and generalizability. Explainable artificial intelligence is an emerging approach for promoting credibility, accountability, and trust in mission-critical areas such as medicine by combining machine-learning approaches with explanatory techniques that explicitly show what the decision criteria are and why (or how) they have been established. Hence, thinking about how machine learning could benefit from knowledge graphs that combine "common sense" knowledge as well as semantic reasoning and causality models is a potential solution to this problem. Objective: In this study, we aimed to leverage explainable artificial intelligence, and propose a proof-of-concept prototype for a knowledge-driven evidence-based recommendation system to improve mental health surveillance. Methods: We used concepts from an ontology that we have developed to build and train a question-answering agent using the Google DialogFlow engine. In addition to the question-answering agent, the initial prototype includes knowledge graph generation and recommendation components that leverage third-party graph technology. Results: To showcase the framework functionalities, we here present a prototype design and demonstrate the main features through four use case scenarios motivated by an initiative currently implemented at a children's hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Ongoing development of the prototype requires implementing an optimization algorithm of the recommendations, incorporating a privacy layer through a personal health library, and conducting a clinical trial to assess both usability and usefulness of the implementation. Conclusions: This semantic-driven explainable artificial intelligence prototype can enhance health care practitioners' ability to provide explanations for the decisions they make.

This study aimed to assess doctors' smoking control knowledge, attitudes and practices to help doctors raise awareness of smoking control assistance.MethodsThis cross-sectional study recruited 1046 doctors from Shandong Province, China, by using multistage sampling. Participants' information was collected by questionnaire. Pearson's chi (2) test and Fisher's exact probability method were used to compare the distributions of categorical variables between/among groups.ResultsAmong the participants, 14.7% were current smokers. Approximately 50.3% of participants had heard of smoking cessation drugs and 59.2% of participants thought that low-tar and low-nicotine cigarettes were as harmful to health as common cigarettes. Approximately 98.2 and 60.9% of participants agreed that smoking was related to lung cancer and male sexual dysfunction, respectively. Although 72.0% of participants believed that doctors should actively provide smoking cessation assistance, only 58.1% of participants considered that doctors should be responsible for providing smoking cessation assistance. Similarly, 85.2% of participants often asked about the smoking history of patients or their family members, while only 4.9% of participants had prescribed smoking cessation drugs for patients. Pediatricians had a higher proportion of "Agree" responses to the assessment items than doctors in other departments.ConclusionsThe results showed that doctors in Shandong Province did not have sufficient knowledge of smoking control. Slightly more than half of doctors thought that providing smoking cessation assistance was their responsibility. Only a few participants had prescribed smoking cessation drugs.

Thirteen male rectal cancer survivors who were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) for rectal cancer participated (median time post-treatment was 6.4 years). Six survivors participated in individual semi-structured phone interviews, and seven others took part in focus groups. We performed standard procedures of qualitative thematic text analysis, which involved independent review of interview and focus group transcripts by several analysts followed by consensus meetings to identify key themes. Participants reported bowel dysfunction (N = 13, or 100 %) and erectile dysfunction (N = 12, or 92 %) as chief complaints. The participants thought a psychoeducational sexual health intervention post-surgery would be helpful because it would provide educational information regarding the etiology of their problems and treatments to improve their sexual health (N = 8, or 62 %). Most participants' primary concern immediately after treatment was surviving their disease; improving sexual functioning seemed to become more important over time. Barriers to potentially participating in a psycho-educational sexual health intervention included geographical distance from MSKCC (N = 3, or 3/13) and the risk of embarrassment when discussing sexual issues (N = 5, or 5/13). Men reported that a psycho-educational sexual health intervention would be helpful to improve their sexual functioning post-treatment. Discussion of bowel issues and logistical concerns gave information on the psycho-educational sexual health intervention.

Studies conducted during the DMS development process aimed to minimize cognitive burden and use-related risks and demonstrated effective use of the technology. Methods: Human factors (HF) studies assessed the system's safe and effective use by the intended users for the intended uses. The patient interface was tested in six formative HF studies followed by a validation study. The HCP/caregiver interface was tested in one study before validation. All tasks critical to safety or necessary for effective use were included. Formative studies identified use-related risks and the causes of use problems to guide design modification. Validation of the patient and HCP/caregiver interfaces assessed risks of the final product. Results: During the patient formative studies, design improvements were made to address problems and mitigate risks thought to be associated with a suboptimal system design or patient understanding of the system. In the validation study of the patient interface, 35 patients attempted 23 performance tasks, for a total of 805 attempts; 783/805 attempts were completed with success. One close call, 15 failures, and 6 difficulties occurred on these user tasks; only 3 of these were on a critical task. Residual risks resistant to mitigation were found to be of low severity based on the US Food and Drug Administration 2016 guidance. Conclusion: The final design of the DMS reflects input by the intended user populations through a comprehensive development methodology. In alignment with the US Food and Drug Administration goals for HF studies, the system was found to be safe and effective for the intended users, uses, and use environments.

This approach includes individual patient consultations with a practice nurse, who coaches patients in COPD management. The aim of this study was to gauge the feasibility of adding a web-based patient self-management support application, by assessing patients' self-management, patients' health status, the impact on the organization of care, and the level of application use and appreciation. Methods: The study employed a mixed methods design. Six practice nurses recruited COPD patients during a consultation. The e-Health application included a questionnaire that captured information on demographics, self-management related behaviors (smoking cessation, physical activity and medication adherence) and their determinants, and nurse recommendations. The application provided tailored feedback messages to patients and provided the nurse with reports. Data were collected through questionnaires and medical record abstractions at baseline and one year later. Semi-structured interviews with patients and nurses were conducted. Descriptive statistics were calculated for quantitative data and content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data. Results: Eleven patients, recruited by three nurses, used the application 1 to 7 times (median 4). Most patients thought that the application supported self-management, but their interest diminished after multiple uses. Impact on patients' health could not be determined due to the small sample size. Nurses reported benefits for the organization of care and made suggestions to optimize the use of the reports. Conclusion: Results suggest that it is possible to integrate a web-based COPD self-management application into the current primary care disease management process. The pilot study also revealed opportunities to improve the application and reports, in order to increase technology use and appreciation.

Product lifecycle management plays an important role in minimizing the time required for managing engineering changes. This research aims to perform an extensive survey of the literature in this area. There is no consolidated review available in this area summarizing advances in engineering change management vis-a-vis product lifecycle management. Thus, the paper gives an overview of product lifecycle management-based thinking and change management. This review puts forward the most relevant research regarding the practices and frameworks developed for managing engineering change in an organization.

J	Bengtsson, M; Ohlsson, B				Bengtsson, Mariette; Ohlsson, Bodil			The nursing and medical students motivation to attain knowledge	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Article						Knowledge; Learning; Medical students; Motivation; Nursing students	FOCUS GROUPS	Objectives: The aim was to gather information regarding what students consider important for their motivation to attain knowledge, in order to shape courses that foster this motivation. Method: A qualitative design comprising focus groups including 31 nursing and medical students for interviews, semi-structured questions, and content analysis was utilized. Result: The students thought it was important to coordinate more superficial knowledge with learning in depth, and to apply the theoretical knowledge in practise. Self-motivation, committed teachers and discussions with other students were considered to be important for learning. The difference between the groups was that the nurses were focused on their assessments because of lack of time, while the medical students were more learning for life. Their greatest problem was to know what of all knowledge they needed to learn and should focus on. Conclusion: The motivation must come from the students themselves, but dedicated teachers giving performance feed-back, discussions in different forms and choices of learning and assessment methods enhance enthusiasm and learning. By providing an educational environment that resonates with the students' needs, teachers may be successful in their teaching. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Marine sponges are diverse, abundant and ecologically important components of coral reefs in both coastal and offshore environments. Due to their exceptionally high filtration rates, sponges also form a crucial coupling point between benthic and pelagic habitats. Sponges harbor extensive microbial communities, with many microbial phylotypes found exclusively in sponges and thought to contribute to the health and survival of their hosts. Manipulative experiments were undertaken to ascertain the impact of elevated nutrients and seawater temperature on health and microbial community dynamics in the Great Barrier Reef sponge Rhopaloeides odorabile. R. odorabile exposed to elevated nutrient levels including 10 mu mol/L total nitrogen at 31 degrees C appeared visually similar to those maintained under ambient seawater conditions after 7 days. The symbiotic microbial community, analyzed by 16S rRNA gene pyrotag sequencing, was highly conserved for the duration of the experiment at both phylum and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) (97% sequence similarity) levels with 19 bacterial phyla and 1743 OTUs identified across all samples. Additionally, elevated nutrients and temperatures did not alter the archaeal associations in R. odorabile, with sequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries revealing similar Thaumarchaeota diversity and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealing consistent amoA gene patterns, across all experimental treatments. A conserved eukaryotic community was also identified across all nutrient and temperature treatments by DGGE. The highly stable microbial associations indicate that R. odorabile symbionts are capable of withstanding short-term exposure to elevated nutrient concentrations and sub-lethal temperatures.

Use of strategies to improve retention in primary care randomised trials: a qualitative study with in-depth interviews	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						Retention strategies; Randomised trials; Primary Care	RECRUITMENT; PREVENTION	Objective To explore the strategies used to improve retention in primary care randomised trials. Design Qualitative in-depth interviews and thematic analysis. Participants 29 UK primary care chief and principal investigators, trial managers and research nurses. Methods In-depth face-to-face interviews. Results Primary care researchers use incentive and communication strategies to improve retention in trials, but were unsure of their effect. Small monetary incentives were used to increase response to postal questionnaires. Non-monetary incentives were used although there was scepticism about the impact of these on retention. Nurses routinely used telephone communication to encourage participants to return for trial follow-up. Trial managers used first class post, shorter questionnaires and improved questionnaire designs with the aim of improving questionnaire response. Interviewees thought an open trial design could lead to biased results and were negative about using behavioural strategies to improve retention. There was consensus among the interviewees that effective communication and rapport with participants, participant altruism, respect for participant's time, flexibility of trial personnel and appointment schedules and trial information improve retention. Interviewees noted particular challenges with retention in mental health trials and those involving teenagers. Conclusions The findings of this qualitative study have allowed us to reflect on research practice around retention and highlight a gap between such practice and current evidence. Interviewees describe acting from experience without evidence from the literature, which supports the use of small monetary incentives to improve the questionnaire response. No such evidence exists for non-monetary incentives or first class post, use of which may need reconsideration. An exploration of barriers and facilitators to retention in other research contexts may be justified.	[Brueton, V. C.; Vale, C. L.; Stenning, S. P.; Tierney, J.

The principle for interpreting protein selectivity and fidelity stems from optimization of the active site upon protein-substrate complexation, i.e., a lock-and-key configuration, on which most protein-substrate molecule binding recognition, and hence drug discovery, relies. Yet another thought has been to incorporate the protein folding interior tunnels for stereo- and regio-selectivity along the protein-substrate or protein-ligand/inhibitor binding process. Free energy calculations provide valuable information for molecular recognition and protein-ligand binding dynamics and kinetics. In this study, we focused on the kinetics of cytochrome P450 proteins (CYP450s) and the protein interior tunnel structure-dynamics relationship in terms of the substrate binding and leaving mechanism. A case in point is given by the prostaglandin H-2 (PGH(2)) homologous isomerase of prostacyclin synthase. To calculate the reactant and product traversing the tunnels to and from the heme site, the free energy paths and tunnel potentials of mean force are constructed from steered molecular dynamics simulations and adaptive basing force umbrella sampling simulations. We explore the binding tunnels and critical residue lining characteristics for the ligand traverse and the underlying mechanism of CYP450 activity. Our theoretical analysis provides insights into the decisive role of the substrate tunnel binding process of the CYP450 mechanism and may be useful in drug design and protein engineering contexts.

The question we addressed is how the two aspects, reward size and proximity to reward, influence the responses of neurons in rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), a brain region thought to play an important role in reward processing. Methods and Findings: We recorded from single neurons while two monkeys performed a multi-trial reward schedule task. The monkeys performed 1-4 sequential color discrimination trials to obtain a reward of 1-3 liquid drops. There were two task conditions, a valid cue condition, where the number of trials and reward amount were associated with visual cues, and a random cue condition, where the cue was picked from the cue set at random. In the valid cue condition, the neuronal firing is strongly modulated by the predicted reward proximity during the trials. Information about the predicted reward amount is almost absent at those times. In substantial subpopulations, the neuronal responses decreased or increased gradually through schedule progress to the predicted outcome. These two gradually modulating signals could be used to calculate the effect of time on the perception of reward value. In the random cue condition, little information about the reward proximity or reward amount is encoded during the course of the trial before reward delivery, but when the reward is actually delivered the responses reflect both the reward proximity and reward amount. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the rACC neurons encode information about reward proximity and amount in a manner that is dependent on utility of reward information. The manner in which the information is represented could be used in the moment-to-moment calculation of the effect of time and amount on predicted outcome value.

Primosome is thought to form via two pathways: one PriA dependent and the other PriA independent. PriC is a key protein in the replication restart of the PriA-independent pathway. In this study, we determined that PriC was divided into two domains. Then, we obtained information that: (i) the C-terminal domain preferentially binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA); (ii) the binding of PriC to ssDNA depends on salt concentration; and (iii) the binding site size of PriC is approximately 7-9 nucleotides. The protease digestion of PriC suggested that a possible DNA-binding site is the N-terminus of the C-terminal domain where basic amino acid residues are concentrated. Interestingly, alpha-helical induction of the C-terminal domain of PriC occurred after the addition of DNAs. Also, we examined the role of heptad repeat of leucine or valine residues in the C-terminal domain and PriC oligomerization. This study describes the structure and function analysis of PriC which forms the primosome complex in replication restart.

We explored patients' experiences of using Internet-based self-management support for low back pain (LBP) in primary care, with and without physiotherapist telephone guidance. Design. Exploratory descriptive qualitative study using thematic analysis, nested within a randomized feasibility trial. Methods. Patients with LBP who participated in a feasibility trial of the SupportBack Internet intervention (ISRCTN: 31034004) were invited to take part in semistructured telephone interviews after the three-month intervention period (a convenience sample from within the trial population). Fifteen participants took part (age range = 36-87 years, 66.7% female, characteristics representative of the trial population). Data were analyzed thematically. Results. Analysis resulted in the development of six themes (subthemes in parentheses): Perceptions of SupportBack's design (Clarity and ease of use, Variety and range of information provided, Need for specificity and flexibility), Engaging with the SupportBack intervention, Promoting positive thought processes (Reassurance, Awareness of self-management), Managing behavior with SupportBack (Motivation and goal setting, Using activity as a pain management strategy, Preferences for walking or gentle back exercises), Feeling supported by telephone physiotherapists (Provision of reassurances and clarity, Physiotherapists are motivating), Severity and comorbidity as barriers (Preexisting condition or severity acting as a barrier, Less useful for mild low back pain). Conclusions. The Internet intervention SupportBack appeared to feasibly support self-management of LBP.

Design: Cross-sectional research using a questionnaire that included food-safety knowledge, perceptions, risk-reduction behavior, stages for the selection of safer food based on the Transtheoretical Model, and demographic characteristics. Setting: Four universities in eastern Japan and 2 universities in western Japan. Participants: University students (n = 799). Main Outcome Measures: Food-safety knowledge, beliefs, and risk-reduction behaviors. Analysis: Answers on measures assessing risk perception and food-safety knowledge were combined to form 4 groups of participants. Relationships among demographic characteristics, the 4 groups, risk-reduction behaviors, stage of change, and severity and susceptibility were assessed. Results: The proportion of students who had more knowledge of food safety and a belief that "there are no 100% safe food items'' was high in the group that frequently performed risk-reduction behaviors, as it was in the group who had taken a basic class about food or health care and who had, or were working toward, a food or nutrition qualification. Conclusions and Implications: University students who thought that there were no 100% safe food items and who had more knowledge about food safety were more likely to confirm food-safety information when selecting food.

However, its effectiveness in improving student learning has not yet been assessed. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of teaching with such pedagogical approach by examining studies that compare the FC approach with the traditional lecture-based learning (LBL) module through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Seven databases, including the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, Chinese Wanfang database, and China Biomedical Literature Database, were searched from the inception to 30 June 2021, to identify eligible articles of randomized controlled studies. The primary outcomes included the theoretical and experimental test scores, and the secondary outcomes were the results from questionnaires about the number of students who preferred the FC or endorsed its improving effects on their learning enthusiasm, self-learning ability, thinking skills, communication skills, and learning efficiency. The quantitative synthesis was conducted with Revman V.5.3 software following the Cochrane Reviewer's Handbook guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Results: Eleven eligible studies published from 2017 to 2020 enrolling 1,200 students were included in this meta-analysis. The quantitative synthesis demonstrated that the FC module presented an overall more significant effectiveness over traditional LBL approach for Chinese pharmacy education in improving student academic performance as measured by theoretical test scores (SMD = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.60-1.56, p < 0.00001) and experimental test scores (MD = 6.62, 95% CI: 4.42-8.82, p < 0.00001). Further sub-group analysis revealed that the preferable effectiveness of FC was also evident in both theory-oriented (SMD = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.10-1.45, p < 0.00001) and experiments-oriented courses (MD = 6.52, 95% CI: 3.48-9.56, p < 0.00001) for both undergraduate (SMD = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.31-1.37, p < 0.00001) and 3-year junior-college students (MD = 8.17, 95% CI: 6.44-9.89, p < 0.00001). Additionally, analysis on the questionnaire outcomes revealed that more respondents preferred for FC and endorsed its improvement effects on developing students' learning enthusiasm, self-learning ability, thinking skills, communication skills, and learning efficiency. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that FC pedagogical approach can effectively improve student learning outcomes and is applicable to Chinese pharmacy education.

An interprofessional collaborative team comprising university faculty and undergraduate students developed and presented a community outreach event to provide education and health screening to a diverse group of local residents. Design: An event entitled Rhythms of the Heart was planned and implemented to reach community members. Setting: The event took place on the campus of a private college in Central Florida, USA. Methods: Clinical services, including health screening for blood pressure and body fat, were provided, along with information on the benefits of smoking cessation, physical activity, weight management, healthy diet alternatives and stress reduction. Local community resources and educational materials were supplied to event participants. Results: The event attracted approximately 275 guests. An analysis of feedback from attendees indicated a greater appreciation of music to enhance one's understanding of cardiovascular health. Students and attendees perceived the Rhythms of the Heart concert as smart and creative', cleverly conceived' and well thought out'. Conclusion: This interprofessional outreach event provided a novel means by which to undertake community education and health screening.

Khat use is thought to increase the risk of psychosis among its chewers. The evidence around this however remains inconclusive stemming from the scanty number of studies in this area and small study sample sizes. We undertook a large household survey to determine the association between psychotic symptoms and khat chewing in a rural khat growing and chewing population in Kenya.MethodsFor this cross-sectional household survey, we randomly selected 831 participants aged 10years and above residing in the Eastern region of Kenya. We used the psychosis screening questionnaire (PSQ) to collect information on psychotic symptoms and a researcher designed sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire to collect information on its risk factors. We used descriptive analysis to describe the burden of khat chewing and other substance use as well as rates and types of psychotic symptoms. Using a univariate and multivariate analyses with 95% confidence interval, we estimated the association between khat chewing and specific psychotic symptoms.ResultsThe prevalence of current khat chewing in the region was at 36.8% (n=306) with a male gender predominance (54.8%). At least one psychotic symptom was reported by 16.8% (n=168) of the study population. Interestingly, psychotic symptoms in general were significantly prevalent in women (19.5%) compared to men (13.6%) (p=0.023). Khat chewing was significantly associated with reported strange experiences (p=0.024) and hallucinations (p=0.0017), the two predominantly reported psychotic symptoms. In multivariate analysis controlling for age, gender, alcohol use and cigarette smoking, there was a positive association of strange experiences (OR, 2.45; 95%CI, 1.13-5.34) and hallucination (OR, 2.08; 95% C.I, 1.06-4.08) with khat chewing. Of note was the high concurrent polysubstance use among khat chewers specifically alcohol use (78.4%) and cigarette smoking (64.5%).ConclusionsPsychotic symptoms were significantly elevated in khat users in this population. Future prospective studies examining dose effect and age of first use may establish causality.

While there has been considerable research on voice personality perception, much less is known about its relevance to hallucination-proneness, despite auditory hallucinations being frequently perceived as personified social agents. The present paper reports two studies investigating the relation between voice personality perception and hallucination-proneness in non-clinical samples. A voice personality perception task was created, in which participants rated short voice recordings on four personality characteristics, relating to dimensions of the voice's perceived Valence and Dominance. Hierarchical regression was used to assess contributions of Valence and Dominance voice personality ratings to hallucination-proneness scores, controlling for paranoia-proneness and vividness of mental imagery. Results from Study 1 suggested that high ratings of voices as dominant might be related to high hallucination-proneness; however, this relation seemed to be dependent on reported levels of paranoid thinking. In Study 2, we show that hallucination-proneness was associated with high ratings of voice dominance, and this was independent of paranoia and imagery abilities scores, both of which were found to be significant predictors of hallucination-proneness. Results from Study 2 suggest an interaction between gender of participants and the gender of the voice actor, where only ratings of own gender voices on Dominance characteristics are related to hallucination-proneness scores. These results are important for understanding the perception of characterful features of voices and its significance for psychopathology.

To visualize the distribution of SM in lipid rafts by means of Raman microscopy, we designed and synthesized an SM analog tagged with a Raman-active diyne moiety (diyne-SM). Diyne-SM showed a strong peak in a Raman silent region that is free of interference from intrinsic vibrational modes of lipids and did not appear to alter the properties of SM-containing monolayers. Therefore, we used Raman microscopy to directly visualize the distribution of diyne-SM in raft-mimicking domains formed in SM/dioleoylphosphatidylcholine/chol ternary monolayers. Raman images visualized a heterogeneous distribution of diyne-SM, which showed marked variation, even within a single ordered domain. Specifically, diyne-SM was enriched in the central area of raft domains compared with the peripheral area. These results seem incompatible with the generally accepted raft model, in which the raft and nonraft phases show a clear biphasic separation. One of the possible reasons is that gradual changes of SM concentration occur between SM-rich and -poor regions to minimize hydrophobic mismatch. We believe that our technique of hyperspectral Raman imaging of a single lipid monolayer opens the door to quantitative analysis of lipid membranes by providing both chemical information and spatial distribution with high (diffraction-limited) spatial resolution.

Therefore, in this investigation, particles from a 100 kW(th) steam-O-2 blown circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) gasifier were sampled and characterized. The sampling was performed with a specially designed heated dilution probe downstream of a high-temperature candle filter element. The dilution probe was followed by a bed of activated carbon to separate the condensed phase from the particle phase by reducing the supersahuation of the volatile material. Parallel measurements were performed by a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) and sample collection by a cascade impactor assembly to obtain information about the particle size distribution and elemental analysis, respectively. The measured particle mass was found to be dominated by coarse particles from bed material together with high amounts of potassium, which is thought to have penetrated through the filter. The aim of this work is to validate the developed particle measuring setup by performing physical and chemical characterization of the fine-particle fraction that is not captured by the filtering system to avoid the catalytic deactivation of the downstream upgrading processing.

Examination of metabolic pathways, specifically glycolysis, in this framework led to several conclusions. (i) Linked enzyme catalyzed reaction sequences are so closely integrated with each other that large changes in flux through the pathway are sustained with minimal changes in concentrations of pathway intermediates. This is true for both low and high capacity pathways and is consistent with the 'economic design' expectations of symmorphosis. (ii) In the glycolytic pathway, some enzymes (termed hE) occur at high concentrations and high activities, while others (IE), usually enzymes operating in vivo far from equilibrium, occur at lower concentrations and lower activities. Although genes for glycolytic enzymes are thought to be coordinately regulated by being linked to common inducing or repressing signals, during long term (phylogenetic) up or down regulation of glycolytic capacity, the expression of genes for hE type enzymes are adjusted the most; the expression of IE type (usually enzymes functioning far from equilibrium) are up or down regulated the least. These differences are of lower magnitude but are also evident in short term up or down regulation of the pathway of glycolysis (such as induction by hypoxia and repression during electrical stimulation and fiber type transformation in muscle). (iii) when considered together, these data require that, despite coordinate regulation of the overall functional unit (glycolysis), the expression pathway for each enzyme in the sequence must be under unique feedback regulation, implying an unique information flow circuit (gene --> enzyme --> gene) for each enzyme in the metabolic pathway. (iv) The matching of flux capacities in linked sequences thus seems to apply 'across the board' - not only horizontally but also vertically - in cell metabolic design. That is, up or down change in demand for glycolytic function(horizontal pathway) is integrated with up or down regulation of gene expression (vertical pathway). While a general feedback loop from metabolism to genes has been previously recognized, the step-by-step specificity required for-the pathway as a whole has been overlooked. The intriguing question of how enzymes within a single pathway self modulate or fine tune their own expression rate according to their functional role in the pathway remains unanswered, although a number of potential regulatory mechanisms are known.

Mainstreaming nature-based solutions: What role do Communities of Practice play in delivering a paradigm shift?	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Flood risk management; Social learning; Triple -loop learning framework	FLOOD RISK-MANAGEMENT; WATER GOVERNANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; COPRODUCTION; ACTORS	As the urgency to adapt to climate change intensifies, nature-based solutions (NBS) are receiving increasing attention. To mainstream NBS, a fundamental shift in environmental management is required. This study evaluates the role that Communities of Practice (CoP) can play as platforms to foster social learning to drive such a paradigm shift. A Natural Flood Management (NFM) CoP in Yorkshire, UK, was used as a case study. A unique research design combined opportunistic data collected prior to the inception of the CoP and purposive data collected during and after its formation. Opportunistic data captured information from stakeholders regarding NFM engagement and challenges around its instalment and delivery. Purposive data was used to examine the ability of a CoP to foster social learning, overcome the challenges identified prior to its establishment and evaluate the extent to which a CoP contributes to inducing a NBS paradigm shift, using a multi-loop social learning framework. Results demonstrate that the CoP was effective in delivering social learning and improving NFM instalment and delivery. While most evidence of social learning point to incremental rather than trans-formational changes, it did reveal abundant questioning of the current framing of flood management. Further-more, the CoP seems to have encouraged some participants to re-think the current governance structures for NFM and the boundaries of current actor networks, raising promise that, if sustained in the longer term, the CoP could induce a paradigm shift. Further research should conduct longitudinal studies to examine the CoP's development overtime and its potential for overcoming current constraints.

J	Aziz, A; Ohlsson, A				Aziz, Abdul; Ohlsson, Arne			Surfactant for pulmonary hemorrhage in neonates	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							THERAPY; INFANTS	Background In the late 1960' s and 1970's, pulmonary hemorrhage (PH) occurred mainly in full term infants with severe pre-existing illness. The incidence of PH was quoted as 1.3 per 1,000 live births. In the older medical literature, the risk factors associated with PH included the severity of the associated illness, intrauterine growth restriction, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), coagulopathy, and the need for assisted ventilation. Presently, PH occurs mainly in preterm ventilated infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) who often have a PDA and have received surfactant. Currently, PH complicates the hospital course of 3-5% of preterm infants with RDS. Although not clear, the cause of PH is thought to be due to a rapid lowering of intrapulmonary pressure, which facilitates left to right shunting across a patent ductus arteriosus and an increase in pulmonary blood flow. Retrospective case reports and one prospective uncontrolled study that used surfactant for PH in neonates have shown promising results in treating PH. Objectives To evaluate the effect of surfactant treatment compared to placebo or no intervention on mortality in neonates with pulmonary hemorrhage. In addition, the review will evaluate the effect of surfactant treatment on neonatal morbidities associated with PH compared to placebo or no intervention. Search strategy The following databases were searched in January 2008: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2007) and MEDLINE from 1966 and EMBASE from 1980 to the time of the full review using the OVID interface. The proceedings of the Annual Meetings of the Pediatric Academic Societies and the European Society of Pediatric Research published in Pediatric Research or electronically on their web sites were searched from 1994 to the time of the full review. Science citation index (Web of Science) was searched for authors quoting key references of observational studies. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effect of surfactant in the treatment of PH in intubated term or preterm (< 37 weeks) neonates with PH. Infants were included up to 44 weeks postmenstrual age. Infants were included regardless of prior treatment with surfactant. The interventions studied were intratracheal instillation of surfactant (natural or synthetic, regardless of dose) vs. placebo or no intervention. Data collection and analysis If studies were identified by the literature search, the planned analyses included calculation of the relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed to harm (NNH) for dichotomous outcomes, and weighed mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes, with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). A fixed effects model would be used for meta-analyses. Heterogeneity tests, including the I-squared (I-2) statistic, would be performed to assess the appropriateness of pooling the data and the results would be reported. Main results No trials were identified. Auhtors' conclusions No randomized or quasi-randomized trials that evaluated the effect of surfactant in PH were identified. Therefore, no conclusions from such trials can be drawn. In view of the promising results from studies with less strict study designs than a randomized controlled trial, there is reason to conduct further trials of surfactant for the treatment of PH in neonates. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Surfactant for pulmonary hemorrhage in neonates Bleeding into the lungs (pulmonary hemorrhage) occurs mainly in infants born before term (37 weeks gestation) because of severe lung disease [particularly respiratory distress syndrome, a disease caused by the lack of the normal lining chemicals of the lung (surfactant)] and the need for a breathing machine (assisted ventilation). The risk factors for pulmonary hemorrhage include prematurity, poor growth while in the womb (intrauterine growth restriction), respiratory problems, abnormal blood flow around the blood vessels in the lungs (patent ductus arteriosus), bleeding problems (coagulopathy), the need for a breathing machine, and surfactant treatment. The underlining cause of pulmonary hemorrhage is thought to be a rapid increase in pulmonary blood flow due to a patent ductus arteriosus. Some studies have shown promising results with the use of surfactant treatment in infants with pulmonary hemorrhage. However, no randomized controlled trials were identified in this review. Currently, no recommendation for clinical practice based on randomized controlled trials can be presented; further research is needed.

Extant literature mainly has focused on the negative consequences of queues and overlooked the potential positive effects. The purpose of this paper is to address the benefits of queues by examining how consumers of different segments may read into the lines (queues) as well as why and when positive effects occur. Design/methodology/approach Applying and integrating psychology and marketing theories, the study develops a model with several propositions to identify and explain the mechanism and conditions under which queues have positive effects. Findings Contrary to conventional belief, queues may serve as positive signs. In certain segments, consumers can perceive a queue as a reflection of superior service/product quality, an opportunity to fulfill the need(s) for self-uniqueness or social inclusion or an avenue to avoid social exclusion. In addition, the benefits of long queues may come from consumers' joining a line to seek desirable outcomes/gains based on their attribution of the queue, and consumers' prefactual thinking that regards not joining the queue as potential losses. Furthermore, the magnitude of such effects depends on queue distinctiveness, choice heterogeneity, consumption hedonism and performance uncertainty. Originality/value This paper explains how, why and when a long queue can be read as positive cues and benefits both the firms and target/potential consumers. The authors demonstrate the psychological mechanisms of joining a queue based on attribution and prefactual thinking, and identify conditions under which positive queue effects are most likely to occur.

This interesting morphology was repeatedly captured from various casting systems, such as PVDF-HFP/N-methyl pyrrolidone(NMP)/glycol, PVDF-HFP/NMP/diethylene glycol, PVDF-HFP/NMP/glycerol and PVDF-HFP/NMP/glucose, with distilled water as a coagulant. The formation of the linear pore pattern was thought to be associated with the orientation of the macromolecular conglomerations in the casting solution, which occurred during the casting process. Thus, relevant experiments were designed and performed to support the hypothesis. The clearly observed linear pore pattern formed with less than 30 s of exposure time before immersing into water bath became faded in 300 s and completely disappeared in 600 s of exposure time, which was in good accordance with the relaxation degree of orientated macromolecular conglomeration. In contrast, the membrane without experiencing the casting process showed a conventional surface morphology, which also demonstrated the effect of the casting process on the membrane surface morphology. In addition, a clearer image of the linear pore pattern was captured when lower concentration polymer dopes were used. In contrast, this phenomenon was invisible for the membrane formed by a higher concentration dope, which is in agreement with the reduction of orientation degree with increasing polymer concentration. Moreover, the systems containing additives with lower viscosity, such as glycerol, glycol, diethylene glycol and glucose, seem to be easier to form a linear pore pattern than the one containing distilled water, the latter produced a nearly elliptical pore pattern on the membrane surface instead. The investigation on this feature may provide more information for a complete description of the initiation and growth of the porous membrane. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, in response to a shortage of human resources, home-care occupational therapists in Quebec, Canada, frequently transfer the clinical task of recommending bathing equipment to support personnel in 'straightforward cases'. However, there is no consensus on what constitutes such cases, and clinicians lack information on how to define a straightforward case. Objective: To characterise 'straightforward cases' when recommending bathing equipment in home-care occupational therapy. Design: The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method, combining a literature review with a three-round survey and one focus group meeting of nine occupational therapists. Results: Eight characteristics required for describing straightforward cases for bathing equipment recommendations were identified. They cover the three dimensions of the Canadian Model of Occupational Performance and Engagement: the occupation, the person, and the person's home environment. Conclusion: The literature review and collective opinion of experienced occupational therapists made it possible to agree on a common language to describe straightforward cases for bathing equipment. The characteristics identified will, it is hoped, support the critical thinking of clinicians deciding whether or not to transfer the task of recommending bathing equipment to support personnel.

Use of HRT among women undergoing coronary angiography was explored to assess whether patterns of use were similar to data drawn from community samples. Using a descriptive design, a convenience sample of 414 postmenopausal women was interviewed. Fifty-eight percent had never used HRT, 18.3% were past users, and 23.7% were currently using HRT. The primary reason given for ever using HRT was for symptoms of menopause. Less than 14% of women cited coronary heart disease (CHD) or osteoporosis as their primary reason for using HRT. The most common reasons for stopping HRT were side effects and fear of cancer. The most common reasons given for never having used HRT were that their healthcare provider had never talked about it and that they had never thought about it. Use of HRT among women undergoing coronary angiography is similar to that found in community samples. The challenge is to promote patient-provider interactions that include information about HRT based on the scientific model as well as attention to women's individual concerns.

Design A systematic research of online databases was undertaken in March 2020 following the PRISMA criteria, including Medline and Web of Science. Results Fifty-nine articles were included. Surveys, interviews, and focus groups were used to collect data from patients, parents, and health care providers (HCPs). Four themes worth exploring emerged: (a) what do patients and professionals think of and know about FP? (b) what makes the fertility discussion happen or not? (c) what, retrospectively, led to FP being pursued or not? and (d) how do patients and HCPs feel about fertility issues? Conclusion A minority of AYAs preserve their fertility (banking assay for 45% of boys and 23% of girls). Yet fertility concerns have a significant impact on the quality of life of young cancer survivors. Although recommendations and guidelines regarding FP are available internationally, there are no specific guidelines as to how to conduct fertility counseling for children and adolescents. Some barriers are not removable, such as a poor prognosis of an obvious severe disease, time constraints for starting treatment, and cultural and religious beliefs. In response to aspects hindering patients and families to be receptive to any discussion at the time of diagnosis, psychological support could reduce the level of emotional distress and help restore a degree of open-mindedness to open a window for discussion. Moreover, as the lack of knowledge of professionals about fertility is frequently pointed out as a limiting factor for fertility discussion, reinforcing professional training regarding FP could be proposed to promote fertility discussion and eventually referral for FP.

Module structure widely exists in biomolecule networks, and complex diseases are usually thought to be caused by perturbations of local neighborhoods in the networks, which can provide useful insights for the study of disease-related genes. However, the mining and effective utilization of the module structure is still challenging in such issues as a disease gene prediction. Results We propose a hybrid disease-gene prediction method integrating multiscale module structure (HyMM), which can utilize multiscale information from local to global structure to more effectively predict disease-related genes. HyMM extracts module partitions from local to global scales by multiscale modularity optimization with exponential sampling, and estimates the disease relatedness of genes in partitions by the abundance of disease-related genes within modules. Then, a probabilistic model for integration of gene rankings is designed in order to integrate multiple predictions derived from multiscale module partitions and network propagation, and a parameter estimation strategy based on functional information is proposed to further enhance HyMM's predictive power. By a series of experiments, we reveal the importance of module partitions at different scales, and verify the stable and good performance of HyMM compared with eight other state-of-the-arts and its further performance improvement derived from the parameter estimation. Conclusions The results confirm that HyMM is an effective framework for integrating multiscale module structure to enhance the ability to predict disease-related genes, which may provide useful insights for the study of the multiscale module structure and its application in such issues as a disease-gene prediction.

J	Boissonneault, A; Peters, T				Boissonneault, Alexandra; Peters, Terri			Concepts of performance in post-occupancy evaluation post-probe: a literature review	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Review						Post-occupancy evaluation; building performance assessment; performance concept; literature review	ASSESSING BUILDING PERFORMANCE; INDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY; CARE FACILITY DESIGN; HEALTH-CARE; OCCUPANCY EVALUATION; ENERGY PERFORMANCE; OFFICE BUILDINGS; HOSPITAL BUILDINGS; RESIDENTIAL CARE; THERMAL COMFORT	Building performance is a widely held goal in the architecture, engineering and construction industries, driven by a shared pursuit of the triple bottom line. This research paper re-examined the term 'performance' and its characterization in post-occupancy evaluation (POE) literature using a semi-systematic review of 160 articles published since 2008. The review identified how performance parameters have been defined, what the dominant attributes of studies are and what metrics have been used to measure them. A thematic content analysis found that many new priorities had emerged in recent years, problematizing Preiser et al.'s 1988 construct of the concept. The main contribution of this paper is a new expanded definition of 'performance' in terms of three interrelated domains: building, people and organization, and the development of subcategories for more nuanced analysis. This definition builds on the building performance-people performance paradigm first established by the UK's PROBE initiative and responds to several shifts in thinking the review results revealed, including a shift from deterministic thinking towards a more bidirectional understanding of the person-environment relationship. Results were further distilled into recommendations to be used by researchers, practitioners and policymakers to identify performance areas of interest and develop more adaptive, integrated approaches to POE work.

Increased gamma connectivity during working memory retention following traumatic brain injury	BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Gamma; EEG connectivity; major depression; traumatic brain injury	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CLOSED-HEAD INJURY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EEG COHERENCE; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; AXONAL INJURY; NETWORKS; SYNCHRONIZATION; IMPAIRMENT	Primary objective: Alterations to functional connectivity following a traumatic brain injury (TBI) may lead to impaired cognitive performance and major depressive disorder (MDD). In particular, functional gamma band connectivity is thought to reflect information binding important for working memory. The objective of this study was to determine whether altered functional gamma connectivity may be a factor in MDD following TBI (TBI-MDD). Research design: This study assessed individuals with TBI-MDD, as well as individuals with TBI alone and MDD alone using electroencephalographic recordings while participants performed a working memory task to assess differences in functional connectivity between these groups. Methods and procedures: Functional connectivity was compared using the debiased weighted phase lag index (wPLI). wPLI was measured from a group of healthy controls (n = 31), participants with MDD (n = 17), participants with TBI (n = 20) and participants with TBI-MDD (n = 15). Main outcomes and results: Contrary to the predictions, this study found both the groups with TBI and TBI-MDD showed higher gamma connectivity from posterior regions during WM retention. Conclusions: This may reflect dysfunctional functional connectivity in these groups, as a result of maladaptive neuroplastic reorganization.

However, little guidance exists over how discharge decision-making can be taught. We aimed to provide educational recommendations concerning outpatient discharge decision-making. Methods: Recommendations were drawn from prior interviews with 40 consultant dermatologists and 56 dermatology outpatients, and from the "traffic light" design discharge information checklist, developed using the Delphi technique. Results: The key strategies to follow to appropriately manage the outpatient discharge process are: to warn patients in advance, to understand patients' agendas, to allow extra time for the discharge process, to prepare patients to self-manage, to provide a "safety net" and provide the GP with a clear management plan. Aspects to be considered include patient mobility, presence of carer, type of employment, diagnostic certainty, and use of the checklist or guidelines. Key training aspects include teaching structured thought processes when discharging, discharging according to context, developing communication and negotiation skills, avoiding decision biases and encouraging good inter-professional collaboration. Training should include the consideration of the possibility of discharge at each consultation. Novel training strategies have been developed on how to appropriately manage the outpatient discharge process, including involving and informing patients. These strategies focus on safe decision-making, being patient-centred and organizing an efficient health care service framework.Conclusion: Structured outpatient discharge training for dermatologists is now possible, based on information from detailed doctor- and patient-based qualitative studies.

Design: Cross-sectional online survey. Setting: Australia-wide. Participants: A total of 4202 adolescent and young women (13-25 years of age; median age 17 years), having reached menarche, living in Australia and currently attending school (n = 2421) or tertiary education (n = 1781). Interventions: Online survey hosted by Qualtrics between November 2017 and January 2018. Data were collected on contraceptive use, management strategies, sources of information, and knowledge of menstruation. Main Outcome Measures: Information on prevalence and effectiveness of different management strategies, health-seeking behavior, knowledge about menstruation, and common menstrual disorders such as endometriosis. Results: The majority of young women did not seek medical advice for their menstrual symptoms, but used information from the Internet (50%) and engaged in self-management, most commonly with over-the-counter medications such as paracetamol (51%) or ibuprofen (52%). Oral contraceptive use was relatively common (35%), and mostly for reduction of menstrual pain (58%). Despite having significant dysmenorrhea, approximately one-half of the participants (51%) thought that their period was normal. Women with higher pain scores were more likely to rate their period as "abnormal" (P < .0001) but not more likely to consult a doctor (P = .13). Only 53% of those at school had heard of endometriosis. Conclusion: Self-management of menstrual symptoms is common, but a significant minority of women are underdosing or choosing ineffective methods. Most women do not seek medical advice even when symptoms are severe, and cannot identify symptoms suggestive of secondary dysmenorrhea. Improved education on menstruation is vital.

To obtain information on how nursing students react to, think about and learn from digital recording as a learning and teaching method over time. Background. Based on the teaching and learning philosophy of the university college, we used digital recording as a tool in our daily sessions in skills laboratory. However, most of the studies referred to in the background review had a duration of from only a few hours to a number of days. We found it valuable to design a study with a duration of two academic semesters. Design. A descriptive and interpretative design was used. Method. First-year bachelor-level students at the department of nursing participated in the study. Data collection was carried out by employing an 'online questionnaire'. The students answered five written, open-ended questions after each of three practical skill sessions. Kvale and Brinkmann's three levels of understanding were employed in the analysis. Results. The students reported that digital recording affected factors such as feeling safe, secure and confident and that video recording was essential in learning and training practical skills. The use of cameras proved to be useful, as an expressive tool for peer learning because video recording enhances self-assessment, reflection, sensing, psychomotor performance and discovery learning. Conclusion. Digital recording enhances the student's awareness when acquiring new knowledge because it activates cognitive and emotional learning. The connection between tutoring, feedback and technology was clear. Relevance to clinical practice. The digital recorder gives students direct and immediate feedback on their performance from the various practical procedures, and may aid in the transition from theory to practice. Students experienced more self-confidence and a feeling of safety in their performances.

Family focused interventions improve child outcomes by about 40 %. However, such services are not available in Sri Lanka.A cross sectional descriptive study was carried out in the general adult psychiatry follow-up clinics in a Teaching Hospital in Colombo, Sri Lanka to assess the needs of parents with mental illness. A specifically designed interviewer administered questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic details, difficulties with parenting and perceived care needs. A specifically designed data extraction form was used to gather information from the clinic records, about the parents' illness.Our study revealed that 45.1 % of children knew that their parent had a psychiatric disorder. A total of 67.3 % of parents believed that their mental illness had an impact on their parenting of which, 26.8 % thought that this impact was marked. 67.8 % of parents believed that their illness was having an impact on their children. A total of 36.4 % of parents reported having concerns about their children's behaviour, emotions or relationships but only 16.4 % of them said that they would discuss these with their treating doctor. Our study showed that mental illness in parents had a substantial impact on parenting and their children. However, those who sought professionals help in this regard were few and far between. Services aimed at the specific needs of these parents should be developed.	[Rohanachandra, Yasodha Maheshi; Amarabandu, H. G.

Practice-specific risk perceptions and self-reported food safety practices	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						endogeneity; food safety practices; response bias; risk perception	CONSUMPTION; PREVALENCE; FREQUENCY	The relationship between risk perception and risk avoidance is typically analyzed using self-reported measures. However, in domains such as driving or food handling, the validity of responses about usual behavior is threatened because people think about the situations in which they are self-aware, such as when they encounter a hazard. Indeed, researchers have often noted a divergence between what people say about their behavior and how they actually behave. Thus, in order to draw conclusions about risk perceptions and risk avoidance from survey data, it is important to identify particular cognitive elements, such as those measured by questions about risk and safety knowledge, risk perceptions, or information search behavior, which may be effective antecedents of self-reported safety behavior. It is also important to identify and correct for potential sources of bias that may exist in the data. The authors analyze the Food and Drug Administration's 1998 Food Safety Survey to determine whether there are consistent cognitive antecedents for three types of safe food practices: preparation, eating, and cooling of foods. An assessment of measurement biases shows that endogeneity of food choices affects reports of food preparation. In addition, response bias affects reports of cooling practices as evidenced by its relation to knowledge and information search, a pattern of cognitive effects unique to cooling practices. After correcting for these biases, results show that practice-specific risk perceptions are the primary cognitive antecedents of safe food behavior, which has implications for the design of effective education messages about food safety.

B.; Okuno, Yasushi; Marcou, Gilles; Varnek, Alexandre; Horvath, Dragos			Computational chemogenomics: Is it more than inductive transfer?	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-AIDED MOLECULAR DESIGN			English	Article						Chemogenomics; Proteochemometrics; QSAR; Machine learning; Inductive transfer	TRICENTRIC PHARMACOPHORE FINGERPRINTS; QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE; PHYSICOCHEMICAL FEATURES; INTERACTION PREDICTION; WEB SERVER; DESCRIPTORS; PEPTIDES; SUPPORT; MODEL; VALIDATION	High-throughput assays challenge us to extract knowledge from multi-ligand, multi-target activity data. In QSAR, weights are statically fitted to each ligand descriptor with respect to a single endpoint or target. However, computational chemogenomics (CG) has demonstrated benefits of learning from entire grids of data at once, rather than building target-specific QSARs. A possible reason for this is the emergence of inductive knowledge transfer (IT) between targets, providing statistical robustness to the model, with no assumption about the structure of the targets. Relevant protein descriptors in CG should allow one to learn how to dynamically adjust ligand attribute weights with respect to protein structure. Hence, models built through explicit learning (EL) by including protein information, while benefitting from IT enhancement, should provide additional predictive capability, notably for protein deorphanization. This interplay between IT and EL in CG modeling is not sufficiently studied. While IT is likely to occur irrespective of the injected target information, it is not clear whether and when boosting due to EL may occur. EL is only possible if protein description is appropriate to the target set under investigation. The key issue here is the search for evidence of genuine EL exceeding expectations based on pure IT. We explore the problem in the context of Support Vector Regression, using more than 9,400 values of 31 GPCRs, where compound-protein interactions are represented by the concatenation of vectorial descriptions of compounds and proteins. This provides a unified framework to generate both IT-enhanced and potentially EL-enabled models, where the difference is toggled by supplied protein information. For EL-enabled models, protein information includes genuine protein descriptors such as typical sequence-based terms, but also the experimentally determined affinity cross-correlation fingerprints. These latter benchmark the expected behavior of a quasi-ideal descriptor capturing the actual functional protein-protein relatedness, and therefore thought to be the most likely to enable EL. EL- and IT-based methods were benchmarked alongside classical QSAR, with respect to cross-validation and deorphanization challenges. A rational method for projecting benchmarked methodologies into a strategy space is given, in the aims that the projection will provide directions for the types of molecule designs possible using a given methodology. While EL-enabled strategies outperform classical QSARs and favorably compare to similar published results, they are, in all respects evaluated herein, not strongly distinguished from IT-enhanced models. Moreover, EL-enabled strategies failed to prove superior in deorphanization challenges. Therefore, this paper raises caution that, contrary to common belief and intuitive expectation, the benefits of chemogenomics models over classical QSAR are quite possibly due less to the injection of protein-related information, and rather impacted more by the effect of inductive transfer, due to simultaneous learning from all of the modeled endpoints. These results show that the field of protein descriptor research needs further improvements to truly realize the expected benefit of EL.	[Brown, J.

The role of personal data value, culture and self-construal in online privacy behaviour	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INFORMATION PRIVACY; INDIVIDUALISM-COLLECTIVISM; E-COMMERCE; DISCLOSURE; ATTITUDE; PARADOX; WILLINGNESS; CONSUMERS; FACEBOOK; CALCULUS	Personal data is ubiquitous in the digital world, can be highly valuable in aggregate, and can lead to unintended intrusions for the data creator. However, individuals' expressions of concern about exposure of their personal information are generally not matched by their behavioural caution. One reason for this mismatch could be the varied and intangible value of personal data. We present three studies investigating the potential association between personal data value and privacy behaviour, assessing both individual and cross-cultural differences in personal data valuation, comparing collectivist and individualistic cultures. Study 1a, using a representative UK sample, found no relationship between personal data value and privacy behaviour. However, Study 1b found Indian (collectivist) participants' privacy behaviour was sensitive to personal data value, unlike US (individualist) participants. Study 2 showed that in a UK sample, privacy behaviour was sensitive to personal data value but only for individuals who think of themselves as more similar to others (i.e., self-construe as similar, rather than different). We suggest those who prioritise group memberships are more sensitive to unintentional disclosure harm and therefore behave in accordance with personal data valuations-which informs the privacy concern-behaviour relationship. Our findings can suggest approaches to encourage privacy behaviours.	[Fleming, Piers; Bayliss, Andrew P.; Edwards, S.

Motivational factors were more important than perceived risk or optimism for compliance to infection control measures in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SOCIAL TRUST; BEHAVIOR; PERCEPTION; COMMUNICATION; CONSEQUENCES; METAANALYSIS; STRATEGIES; BENEFITS; DECISION; MODEL	Compliance to infection control measures may be influenced both by the fear of negative consequences of a pandemic, but also by the expectation to be able to handle the pandemic's challenges. We performed a survey on a representative sample for Norway (N = 4,083) in the first weeks of the COVID-19 lock-down in March 2020. We had preregistered hypotheses to test the effect of optimism and perceived risk on compliance. Perceived risk had small effects on increasing compliance and on leading to more careful information gathering. The expected negative association between optimism and compliance was not supported, and there was instead a small positive association. We found a small effect that optimism was associated with seeing less risk from the pandemic and with a larger optimistic bias. Finally, an exploratory analysis showed that seeing the infection control measures as being effective in protecting others explained a substantial proportion of the variation in compliance. The study indicates that how we think about pandemic risk has complex and non-intuitive relationships with compliance. Our beliefs and motivations toward infection control measures appears to be important for compliance.

Rami; Aumont, Bernard			STRAPS v1.0: evaluating a methodology for predicting electron impact ionisation mass spectra for the aerosol mass spectrometer	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							ORGANIC AEROSOL; VAPOR-PRESSURE; SOA FORMATION; SECONDARY; OXIDATION; MODEL	Our ability to model the chemical and thermodynamic processes that lead to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation is thought to be hampered by the complexity of the system. While there are fundamental models now available that can simulate the tens of thousands of reactions thought to take place, validation against experiments is highly challenging. Techniques capable of identifying individual molecules such as chromatography are generally only capable of quantifying a subset of the material present, making it unsuitable for a carbon budget analysis. Integrative analytical methods such as the Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) are capable of quantifying all mass, but because of their inability to isolate individual molecules, comparisons have been limited to simple data products such as total organic mass and the O : C ratio. More detailed comparisons could be made if more of the mass spectral information could be used, but because a discrete inversion of AMS data is not possible, this activity requires a system of predicting mass spectra based on molecular composition. In this proof-of-concept study, the ability to train supervised methods to predict electron impact ionisation (EI) mass spectra for the AMS is evaluated. Supervised Training Regression for the Arbitrary Prediction of Spectra (STRAPS) is not built from first principles. A methodology is constructed whereby the presence of specific mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) channels is fitted as a function of molecular structure before the relative peak height for each channel is similarly fitted using a range of regression methods. The widely used AMS mass spectral database is used as a basis for this, using unit mass resolution spectra of laboratory standards. Key to the fitting process is choice of structural information, or molecular fingerprint. Our approach relies on using supervised methods to automatically optimise the relationship between spectral characteristics and these molecular fingerprints. Therefore, any internal mechanisms or instrument features impacting on fragmentation are implicitly accounted for in the fitted model. Whilst one might expect a collection of keys specifically designed according to EI fragmentation principles to offer a robust basis, the suitability of a range of commonly available fingerprints is evaluated. Using available fingerprints in isolation, initial results suggest the generic public "MACCS" fingerprints provide the most accurate trained model when combined with both decision trees and random forests, with median cosine angles of 0.94-0.97 between modelled and measured spectra. There is some sensitivity to choice of fingerprint, but most sensitivity is in choice of regression technique. Support vector machines perform the worst, with median values of 0.78-0.85 and lower ranges approaching 0.4, depending on the fingerprint used. More detailed analysis of modelled versus mass spectra demonstrates important composition-dependent sensitivities on a compound-by-compound basis. This is further demonstrated when we apply the trained methods to a model alpha-pinene SOA system, using output from the GECKO-A model. This shows that use of a generic fingerprint referred to as "FP4" and one designed for vapour pressure predictions ("Nanoolal") gives plausible mass spectra, whilst the use of the MACCS keys in isolation performs poorly in this application, demonstrating the need for evaluating model performance against other SOA systems rather than existing laboratory databases on single compounds. Given the limited number of compounds used within the AMS training dataset, it is difficult to prescribe which combination of approach would lead to a robust generic model across all expected compositions. Nonetheless, the study demonstrates the use of a methodology that would be improved with more training data, fingerprints designed explicitly for fragmentation mechanisms occurring within the AMS, and data from additional mixed systems for further validation. To facilitate further development of the method, including application to other instruments, the model code for re-training is provided via a public Github and Zenodo software repository.

J	Rajesh, R				Rajesh, R.			Industry 5.0: analyzing the challenges in implementation using grey influence analysis	JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Industry 5; 0; Sustainability; Resilience; Causal modelling; Grey influence analysis	SUSTAINABILITY; DESIGN	PurposeThe author explores the challenges to implementation of Industry 5.0 in the manufacturing sector, considering the developing economy context and studying the causal relationships among factors using an advanced causal modelling technique, the Grey Influence Analysis (GINA). The challenges were further classified based on importance and their influencing power.Design/methodology/approachThe author uses the novel causal modelling technique of GINA to study and understand the influence relations among the challenges to implementation of Industry 5.0.FindingsBased on the results from the expert response-based study in the Indian manufacturing industry, it is seen that the Regulatory challenges (RGC) appear to be the most important challenge that needs to be tackled first, while implementing Industry 5.0. Integration with existing systems and Ethical challenges (ETC) emerge as the second and third most important in the category of challenges, as per the results from the GINA analysis.Research limitations/implicationsThe RGC and the ETC need to be addressed prior to implementation and it is necessary to check whether the technologies comply with regulations and whether it creates serious job displacements. While implementation, the challenges with integration to existing systems can be appropriately tackled.Practical implicationsAs a practical implication of the study, the author suggests that a proactive and reactive approach can be adopted to implement the Industry 5.0 concepts to reality. The RGC can be viewed for the adoption of technology, integration challenges can be viewed by understanding the existing systems, and ETC can be addressed by understanding the workforce in combination with technologies.Originality/valueThe shift in focus on sustainability and resilience has transformed the conventional industries to think beyond efficiency and productivity, toward being more responsible to society. The study analyzes the challenges to implementation of Industry 5.0 and the causal relations among them considering an expert response-based study.

J	Simba, D; Kakoko, D; Semali, I; Kessy, A; Embrey, M				Simba, Daudi; Kakoko, Deodatus; Semali, Innocent; Kessy, Anna; Embrey, Martha			Household Knowledge of Antimicrobials and Antimicrobial Resistance in the Wake of an Accredited Drug Dispensing Outlet (ADDO) Program Rollout in Tanzania	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; ANTIBIOTIC USE; CHILDREN	Introduction Private sector drug shops are an important source of medicines in Tanzania. In 2003, the government introduced the accredited drug dispensing outlet (ADDO) program to improve access to good-quality medicines in rural and peri-urban areas that have frequent drug shortages in public health facilities and few or no registered pharmacies. However, increasing access may also contribute to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to the potential overuse and misuse of drugs. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional household survey in four regions in mainland Tanzaniato characterize consumer care-seeking habits and medicines use and to determine the extent to which members of the community are knowledgeable about antimicrobials and AMR. Within the regions, we applied a multistage cluster sampling design, cascading from districts, wards, and villages to households. Multivariate logistic analysis was done to determine variables influencing knowledge of antimicrobials and AMR, while controlling for confounding factors. Variables included age, occupation, level of education, membership in an insurance scheme, and wealth status. Results and Discussion We revealed that communities in four Tanzanian regions have low levels of knowledge of the concepts of antimicrobials and their use and AMR. Level of public understanding rose with wealth status and education. Only one-third of 1,200 respondents (33.6%) had ever heard of a medicine called an antimicrobial, and 5-15% could name at least one antimicrobial spontaneously. Some thought other medicines, such as paracetamol were antimicrobial (7.5%). People were equally likely to agree that pneumonia should be treated with an antimicrobial (21.4%) as well as common cold (28.4%). Understanding of AMR risks was better, particularly related to HIV and AIDS (32.2%) and malaria (38.6%)-most likely due to information campaigns focused on those two diseases. The level of knowledge decreased the further away respondents lived from an ADDO (p = 0.0001) and where ADDO density was lower (p = 0.001), which supports the use of ADDO dispensers as sources of community information and change agents for more appropriate medicine use. Conclusion Lack of knowledge about antimicrobials and AMR in Tanzanian communities needs to be addressed through multi-pronged strategies that focus on prescribers and the public-especially those who are poorer and less educated.

Zinc intake, status and indices of cognitive function in adults and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION			English	Review							DOSE-RESPONSE METAANALYSIS; SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN; MICRONUTRIENT SUPPLEMENTATION; CHINESE CHILDREN; PREGNANT-WOMEN; MOTOR FUNCTION; DEFICIENCY; BRAIN; GROWTH; PERFORMANCE	In developing countries, deficiencies of micronutrients are thought to have a major impact on child development; however, a consensus on the specific relationship between dietary zinc intake and cognitive function remains elusive. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the relationship between zinc intake, status and indices of cognitive function in children and adults. A systematic literature search was conducted using EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases from inception to March 2014. Included studies were those that supplied zinc as supplements or measured dietary zinc intake. A meta-analysis of the extracted data was performed where sufficient data were available. Of all of the potentially relevant papers, 18 studies met the inclusion criteria, 12 of which were randomised controlled trials (RCTs; 11 in children and 1 in adults) and 6 were observational studies (2 in children and 4 in adults). Nine of the 18 studies reported a positive association between zinc intake or status with one or more measure of cognitive function. Meta-analysis of data from the adult's studies was not possible because of limited number of studies. A meta-analysis of data from the six RCTs conducted in children revealed that there was no significant overall effect of zinc intake on any indices of cognitive function: intelligence, standard mean difference of < 0.001 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12, 0.13) P = 0.95; executive function, standard mean difference of 0.08 (95% CI, -0.06, 022) P = 0.26; and motor skills standard mean difference of 0.11 (95% CI -0.17, 0.39) P = 0.43. Heterogeneity in the study designs was a major limitation, hence only a small number (n = 6) of studies could be included in the meta-analyses. Meta-analysis failed to show a significant effect of zinc supplementation on cognitive functioning in children though, taken as a whole, there were some small indicators of improvement on aspects of executive function and motor development following supplementation but high-quality RCTs are necessary to investigate this further.

J	Bejan, A; Lorente, S				Bejan, A; Lorente, S			Thermodynamic optimization of flow geometry in mechanical and civil engineering	JOURNAL OF NON-EQUILIBRIUM THERMODYNAMICS			English	Review							ENTROPY GENERATION MINIMIZATION; CONSTRUCTAL TREE NETWORKS; FINITE-SIZE VOLUME; FREE-CONVECTION; MAXIMUM POWER; HEAT; EFFICIENCY; SYSTEM; MODEL	Recent developments in thermodynamic optimization are reviewed by focusing on the generation of optimal geometric form (shape, structure, topology) in flow systems. The flow configuration is free to vary. The principle that generates geometric form is the pursuit of maximum global performance (e.g., minimum flow resistance, minimum irreversibility) subject to global finiteness constraints (volume, weight, time). The resulting structures constructed in this manner have been named constructal designs. The thought that the same objective and constraints principle accounts for the optimally shaped flow paths that occur in natural systems (animate and inanimate) has been named constructal theory. Examples of large classes of applications are drawn from various sectors of mechanical and civil engineering: the distribution of heat transfer area in power plants, optimal sizing and shaping of flow channels and fins, optimal aspect ratios of heat exchanger core structures, aerodynamic and hydrodynamic shapes, tree-shaped assemblies of convective fins, tree-shaped networks for fluid flow and other currents, optimal configurations for streams that undergo bifurcation or pairing, insulated pipe networks for the distribution of hot water and exergy over a fixed territory, and distribution networks for virtually everything that moves in society (goods, currency, information). The principle-based generation of flow geometry unites the thermodynamic optimization developments known in mechanical engineering with lesser known applications in civil engineering and social organization. This review extends thermodynamics, because it shows how thermodynamic principles of design optimization account for the development of optimal configurations in civil engineering and social organization.

Is active participation in specific sport activities linked with back pain?	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS			English	Article						back pain; sports; adolescent; child	RISK-FACTORS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; SCHOOL-CHILDREN; LUMBAR MOBILITY; SCHOOLCHILDREN; POPULATION; YOUNG; COHORT; ADOLESCENTS; STRENGTH	A cross-sectional survey of 439 children/adolescents aged 12-13, living in Odense, Denmark, in the year 2001. To investigate (1) if there is any difference in back pain reporting among those practising specific sports as compared with non-performers and (2) if there is an association between specific kinds of sports and self-reported back problems. Back pain is a common complaint in young people and physical inactivity is generally thought to contribute to this. However, some specific sport activities may be detrimental or beneficial to the spine. Information was collected through a semi-structured interview, a physical examination, and a questionnaire. Associations for back pain, low back pain, mid back pain and neck pain in the preceding month were investigated in relation to specific sports. Associations were controlled for body mass index, puberty stage and sex. There was no association between back problems and the practising of sports in general. However, some sports were either positively or negatively associated with back pain. Taking into account the relatively small subgroups and multiple testing, some sports seem to be potentially harmful or beneficial. These sports should be investigated in proper longitudinal study designs, in relation to their effects on back problems in the young.	[Mogensen, A. M.; Gausel, A.

However, the cellular and spatial organization of interhemispheric networks and the computational properties they mediate in vertebrates are still poorly understood. Thus, it remains unclear to what extent the connectivity between left and right brain hemispheres participates in sensory processing. Here, we show that the zebrafish olfactory bulbs (OBs) receive direct interhemispheric projections from their contralateral counterparts in addition to top-down inputs from the contralateral zebrafish homolog of olfactory cortex. The direct interhemispheric projections between the OBs reach peripheral layers of the contralateral OB and retain a precise topographic organization, which directly connects similarly tuned olfactory glomeruli across hemispheres. In contrast, interhemispheric top-down inputs consist of diffuse projections that broadly innervate the inhibitory granule cell layer. Jointly, these interhemispheric connections elicit a balance of topographically organized excitation and nontopographic inhibition on the contralateral OB and modulate odor responses. We show that the interhemispheric connections in the olfactory system enable the modulation of odor response and contribute to a small but significant improvement in the detection of a reproductive pheromone when presented together with complex olfactory cues by potentiating the response of the pheromone selective neurons. Taken together, our data show a previously unknown function for an interhemispheric connection between chemosensory maps of the olfactory system.

The revisionist thinking insists indirect incentives and a cooperative, reciprocal relationship are often more appropriate. Those characteristics, however, hark back to the indirect, cooperative interventions that constitute "community conservation", which PES was originally designed as an improvement over. In that context, this study revisits the criticisms and potential benefits of community conservation. We analyze a case study of community conservation in Peru and find that it supported an uptake of forest-friendly behaviors. We take up the suggestion of a two-stage approach to PES, but refine it based on our results that indicate an important role for cognitive (e.g. education) alongside structural interventions (e.g. provision of alternatives), and a strong role for social consensus to support conservationist behavior. Community conservation can provide these elements in a first-stage of PES to create a social context conducive to conservation. Without creating that context first, PES could destabilize local resource management norms rather than improve on them. With the social context established, however, a market mechanism can be implemented in the second stage to reinforce the new conservationist behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Firstly, cube chaos mapping is introduced in the initialization stage to increase the inherent randomness and rationality of the distribution. Then, an improved spiral predation mechanism is proposed for acquiring better exploitation. Moreover, a customized learning strategy is designed after the follower phase to balance exploration and exploitation. A boundary processing mechanism based on the full utilization of important location information is used to improve the rationality of boundary processing. The CLSSA is tested on 21 benchmark optimization problems, and its robustness is verified on 12 high-dimensional functions. In addition, comprehensive search capability is further proven on the CEC2017 test functions, and an intuitive ranking is given by Friedman's statistical results. Finally, three benchmark engineering optimization problems are utilized to verify the effectiveness of the CLSSA in solving practical problems. The comparative analysis shows that the CLSSA can significantly improve the quality of the solution and can be considered an excellent SSA variant.

J	Plotnick, RE; Baumiller, TK				Plotnick, RE; Baumiller, TK			Invention by evolution: functional analysis in paleobiology	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							FINITE-ELEMENT; MORPHOLOGY; TAPHONOMY; CRINOIDS; STROMATOPOROIDS; ECHINODERMATA; SURVIVORSHIP; COMMUNITIES; HYPOTHESIS; DINOSAURS	Functional analysis of fossils is and should remain a key component of paleobiological research. Despite recently expressed doubts, conceptual and methodological developments over the past 25 years indicate that robust and testable claims about function can be produced. Functional statements can be made in at least three different hierarchical contexts, corresponding to the degree of structural information available, the position in the phylogenetic hierarchy and the degree of anatomical specificity The paradigm approach, which dominated thinking about function in the 1960s and 1970s, has been supplanted with a methodology based on biomechanics. Paleobiomechanics does not assume optimality in organismal design, but determines whether structures were capable of carrying out a given function. The paradigm approach can best be viewed as a way of generating, rather than testing, functional hypotheses. Hypotheses about function can also be developed and supported by well-corroborated phylogenetic arguments. Additional functional-evidence can be derived from studies of trace fossils and of taphonomy. New computer techniques, including "Artificial Life" studies, have the potential for producing far more detailed ideas about function and mode of life than have been previously possible. Functional analysis remains the basis for studies of the history of adaptation. It is also an essential component of many paleoecological and paleoenvironmental studies.

Incorporating TechQuity in Virtual Care Within the Veterans Health Administration: Identifying Future Research and Operations Priorities	JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						delivery of healthcare; telemedicine; health equity; veterans; health services research	TELEMEDICINE	BackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic dramatically changed healthcare delivery, driving rapid expansion of synchronous (i.e., real-time) audio-only and video telehealth, otherwise known as virtual care. Yet evidence describes significant inequities in virtual care utilization, with certain populations more dependent on audio-only virtual care than video-based care. Research is needed to inform virtual care policies and processes to counteract current inequities in access and health outcomes.ObjectiveGiven the importance of incorporating equity into virtual care within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), we convened a Think Tank to identify priorities for future research and virtual care operations focused on achieving equitable implementation of virtual care within the VHA.MethodsWe used participatory activities to engage clinicians, researchers, and operational partners from across the VHA to develop priorities for equitable implementation of virtual care. We refined priorities through group discussion and force-ranked prioritization and outlined next steps for selected priorities.Key ResultsThink Tank participants included 43 individuals from the VHA who represented diverse geographical regions, offices, and backgrounds. Attendees self-identified their associations primarily as operations (n = 9), research (n = 28), or both (n = 6). We identified an initial list of 63 potential priorities for future research and virtual care operations. Following discussion, we narrowed the list to four priority areas: (1) measure inequities in virtual care, (2) address emerging inequities in virtual care, (3) deploy virtual care equitably to accommodate differently abled veterans, and (4) measure and address potential adverse consequences of expanded virtual care. We discuss related information, data, key partners, and outline potential next steps.ConclusionsThis Think Tank of research and operational partners from across the VHA identified promising opportunities to incorporate equity into the design and implementation of virtual care. Although much work remains, the priorities identified represent important steps toward achieving this vital goal.

Design and Sample An inductive, exploratory, qualitative study with focus group discussions was selected. Seventeen participants with different professions were invited into five heterogeneous groups. Measures Data were analyzed according to grounded theory. Results Conflicting messages about sexuality became the core category. Participants were of the opinion that pornography conveyed a contradictory message compared with national public health goals, societal laws, and regulations. They believed that young people use pornography as a source of information and stimulation. Furthermore, they thought that pornography contributed to norm-creating ideals and a demanding sexuality, thus, confirming the traditional gender order. The participants opined that a professional approach was required when addressing sexuality and gender equality issues and requested better training tools and more cultural competence. Conclusions Professionals working with adolescents perceived that pornography conveys a conflicting message about sexuality. They expressed a need for adequate tools for improving education on health and sexuality, including gender equality aspects and critical media analysis.

J	Parney, IF; Allen, PBR; Petruk, KC				Parney, IF; Allen, PBR; Petruk, KC			Howard H. Hepburn and the development of skull tongs for cervical spine traction	NEUROSURGERY			English	Biographical-Item						cervical spine; history; skull tongs; traction		THE FIRST USE of skull tongs for cervical spine traction is credited primarily to W.G. Crutchfield. In 1933, Crutchfield described his application of extension tongs to the calvaria of a 23-year-old woman with a traumatic C2-C3 fracture. Less recognized are the contributions of Howard H. Hepburn, who designed skull tongs for cervical spine traction at the University of Alberta several years before Crutchfield's first case. Hepburn was the first neurosurgeon at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. On the basis of his experience treating wounded soldiers in World War I, he developed the hypothesis that traction would promote healing in cervical spine injuries. Hepburn designed skull extension tongs that were modeled on common ice tongs, and he used an automobile inner tube as an elastic to keep the tongs firmly applied to the patient's head. These tongs were first used in the mid-1920s, and by 1930 they were applied routinely. Crutchfield's 1933 report refers to the application of "Edmonton extension tongs." This suggests that he was at least indirectly aware of Hepburn's work, although how this information reached him is not entirely clear. Hepburn attended a meeting of the British Medical Society in 1930, and he is thought to have discussed his tongs during the conference. Hepburn's work has received some attention previously; his original tongs were included in a 1973 Smithsonian Institute exhibit on cervical spine traction as an example of an early cranial traction device. However, his contributions are underappreciated in the neurosurgical community and deserve wider recognition.

The pointer can be controlled in two ways: orthogonally (the pointer can only move with variable speed either horizontally or vertically at a time) and melodically (the pointer can move with fixed speed in any direction). The user study indicates that the users thought the orthogonal control was easier to operate than the melodic control. The orthogonal control was considered useful for controlling mouse movement while the melodic control was more useful for entertainment purposes. Humming was considered less tiring than whistling. This study makes several contributions to the field. First, it is perhaps the first published study investigating the use of whistling to operate a mouse pointer. Second, the system can be used as a low-cost alternative pointing device for people with motor disabilities.

The delicate balance of keeping it all together: Using social capital to manage multiple medications for patients on dialysis	RESEARCH IN SOCIAL & ADMINISTRATIVE PHARMACY			English	Article						ESRD; Hemodialysis; Social support; Medication management; Social capital	ADHERENCE; DISEASE	Objectives: Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) typically have high medication burdens with numerous medications and specialized instructions. Limited data exist regarding ESKD patient perspectives on medication management. Why can some patients self-manage? Which organizational techniques are used? This project sought to determine experiences and attitudes regarding medication management among hemodialysis patients. Methods: Group interviews were conducted with adult patients from 3 dialysis facilities. Semi-structured interviews solicited information about medication self-management and views on related services. Interviews were recorded and transcribed and data were analyzed using inductive, thematic coding. Results: Participants reported medication regimens complicated by the dialysis schedule, co-morbid conditions and multiple prescribers. Patients engaged in various coping strategies, including reliance on activating social capital and/or family social support, to manage their medications and health. When described, most thought medication management services would be beneficial, but not necessarily for themselves, despite some having histories of medication mismanagement. Discussion: Patients on hemodialysis often develop strategies for managing medications that rely heavily on a social network, and strategies may not be discussed with healthcare providers. Social capital is a useful framework for considering patients' lifestyles and support structure when designing a medication regimen. Future research should explore this idea more proactively.

Health promotion evidence indicates that inclusion of cultural values, imagery, linguistics, and health data in a DA will improve ethnic patients' preparation relative to a generic DA; yet, this hypothesis remains untested. Method: Four experiments examined consultation preparation effects of culturally targeted versus generic DAs for Hispanic women living in the United States. Drawing on highly rated online DAs, an experienced Hispanic content developer and Hispanic focus groups worked with researchers to develop culturally targeted digital DAs. Online panels of self-identified Hispanic women in the U.S. were randomly assigned to a targeted or generic DA as part of a scenario-based physician consultation for advanced diabetes (Study 1) or early stage breast cancer (Studies 2-4). Results: Manipulation checks showed high awareness of cultural information in the targeted DA group. Despite efforts to rule out confounds that could account for null effects, DA cultural targeting did not increase knowledge, decision preparedness, or empowerment or reduce decision conflict in the four randomized experiments. Only individual difference variables (e.g., group interdependence) consistently predicted enhanced DA consultation preparation effects. Related research indicates that culture at the group level may exert less influence when individuals think deliberatively, feel less constrained by limited resources such as time, understand processing objectives, and/or are primed with task-specific schema/norms. Conclusion: Given deeper deliberation and clearly primed processing objectives, personal experiences and task-related schema/norms may have significantly reduced the effects of cultural targeting. Consistent findings from four studies suggest that culturally targeted DAs may not better prepare Hispanic women in the U.S. for medical decision making than generic versions designed for the broader population.

Although the channels include voltage-sensor domains (VSDs), their conductance is thought to be independent of the membrane potential, and their gating regulated by cytosolic cyclic nucleotide-binding domains. Mutations in these channels result in severe, degenerative retinal diseases, which remain untreatable. The lack of structural information on CNG channels has prevented mechanistic understanding of disease-causing mutations, precluded structure-based drug design, and hampered in silico investigation of the gating mechanism. To address this, we built a 3D model of the cone tetrameric CNG channel, based on homology to two distinct templates with known structures: the transmembrane (TM) domain of a bacterial channel, and the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain of the mouse HCN2 channel. Since the TM-domain template had low sequence-similarity to the TM domains of the CNG channels, and to reconcile conflicts between the two templates, we developed a novel, hybrid approach, combining homology modeling with evolutionary coupling constraints. Next, we used elastic network analysis of the model structure to investigate global motions of the channel and to elucidate its gating mechanism. We found the following: (i) In the main mode of motion, the TM and cytosolic domains counter-rotated around the membrane normal. We related this motion to gating, a proposition that is supported by previous experimental data, and by comparison to the known gating mechanism of the bacterial KirBac channel. (ii) The VSDs could facilitate gating (supplementing the pore gate), explaining their presence in such 'voltage-insensitive' channels. (iii) Our elastic network model analysis of the CNGA3 channel supports a modular model of allosteric gating, according to which protein domains are quasi-independent: they can move independently, but are coupled to each other allosterically.

The Nucleus Prepositus Hypoglossi Contributes to Head Direction Cell Stability in Rats	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						navigation; neural integrator; oculomotor; place cell; spatial orientation; vestibular	HORIZONTAL EYE-MOVEMENT; BRAIN-STEM NEURONS; ANTERODORSAL THALAMUS; PATH-INTEGRATION; SIGNAL; LESIONS; POSTSUBICULUM; MAP	Head direction (HD) cells in the rat limbic system fire according to the animal's orientation independently of the animal's environmental location or behavior. These HD cells receive strong inputs from the vestibular system, among other areas, as evidenced by disruption of their directional firing after lesions or inactivation of vestibular inputs. Two brainstem nuclei, the supragenual nucleus (SGN) and nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (NPH), are known to project to the HD network and are thought to be possible relays of vestibular information. Previous work has shown that lesioning the SGN leads to a loss of spatial tuning in downstream HD cells, but the NPH has historically been defined as an oculomotor nuclei and therefore its role in contributing to the HD signal is less clear. Here, we investigated this role by recording HD cells in the anterior thalamus after either neurotoxic or electrolytic lesions of the NPH. There was a total loss of direction-specific firing in anterodorsal thalamus cells in animals with complete NPH lesions. However, many cells were identified that fired in bursts unrelated to the animals' directional heading and were similar to cells seen in previous studies that damaged vestibular-associated areas. Some animals with significant but incomplete lesions of the NPH had HD cells that were stable under normal conditions, but were unstable under conditions designed to minimize the use of external cues. These results support the hypothesis that the NPH, beyond its traditional oculomotor function, plays a critical role in conveying vestibular-related information to the HD circuit.

B-Cell Maturation Antigen, A Proliferation-Inducing Ligand, and B-Cell Activating Factor Are Candidate Mediators of Spinal Cord Injury-Induced Autoimmunity	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						autoimmunity; B cell; rehabilitation; spinal cord injury	MYELIN BASIC-PROTEIN; CNS; AUTOANTIBODIES; SYSTEM; CYTOKINES; RESPONSES; MICE	Autoimmunity is thought to contribute to poor neurological outcomes after spinal cord injury (SCI). There are few mechanism-based therapies, however, designed to reduce tissue damage and neurotoxicity after SCI because the molecular and cellular bases for SCI-induced autoimmunity are not completely understood. Recent groundbreaking studies in rodents indicate that B cells are responsible for SCI-induced autoimmunity. This novel paradigm, if confirmed in humans, could aid in the design of neuroprotective immunotherapies. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular signaling pathways and mechanisms by which autoimmunity is induced after SCI, with the goal of identifying potential targets in therapies designed to reduce tissue damage and inflammation in the chronic phase of SCI. To that end, we performed an exploratory microarray analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to identify differentially expressed genes in chronic SCI. We identified a gene network associated with lymphoid tissue structure and development that was composed of 29 distinct molecules and five protein complexes, including two cytokines, a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and B-cell-activating factor (BAFF), and one receptor, B-cell maturation antigen (BMCA) involved in B cell development, proliferation, activation, and survival. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis from ribonucleic acid samples confirmed upregulation of these three genes in SCI. To our knowledge, this is the first report that peripheral blood mononuclear cells produce increased levels of BAFF and APRIL in chronic SCI. This finding provides evidence of systemic regulation of SCI-autoimmunity via APRIL and BAFF mediated activation of B cells through BMCA and points toward these molecules as potential targets of therapies designed to reduce neuroinflammation after SCI.

J	da Cunha, CF; da Silva, MBD; Cheung, TL				da Cunha, Christiano Franca; da Silva, Maurilio Barbosa de Oliveira; Cheung, Thelma Lucchese			Understanding the perception of edible insects	BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL			English	Article						Entomophagy; Consumer behavior; Word association; Brazil	CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE; FOOD; CONSUMPTION; REPRESENTATIONS; COMMUNICATION; ASSOCIATIONS; MANAGEMENT; GERMANY; DISGUST; READY	Purpose Edible insects are increasingly recognized as great food resources of the future. Entomophagy, the practice of eating insects, has a predicted market by 2030 of nearly $8 billion. But this market could grow even more with the acceptance of insects as food by Western consumers, as an alternative to conventional protein sources. In this context, the authors aim to collect and analyze information about consumers' perception of insects as food in Brazil, through the word association task. Design/methodology/approach In total, 751 participants agreed to complete the word association task in relation to entomophagy through an online questionnaire. They had to write down the first five words or terms that came to their minds when they thought of eating insects. Findings Individual mentions were categorized according to their similarities and/or proximity. Based on this grouping the authors identified six dimensions, with emphasis on "hedonic attitudes and feelings", "cultural aspects" and "exotic". The study concludes that Brazilians see insect consumption as belonging to another culture, not Western. Originality/value Few studies have explored the association of words in relation to entomophagy, especially in Brazil. This article aims to fill this gap, using this methodology applied to the Brazilian public.

Enhancing Drought Monitoring and Early Warning for the United Kingdom through Stakeholder Coinquiries	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Europe; Drought; Hydrology; Seasonal forecasting; Agriculture; Ecosystem effects	WEATHER FORECASTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER; INDICATORS; SYSTEMS; IMPACT; UK; RESILIENCE; STREAMFLOW	Drought is widely written about as a complex, multifaceted phenomenon, with complexity arising not just from biophysical drivers, but also human understanding and experiences of drought and its impacts. This has led to a proliferation of different drought definitions and indicators, creating a challenge for the design of drought monitoring and early warning (MEW) systems, which are a key component of drought preparedness. Here, we report on social learning workshops conducted in the United Kingdom aimed at improving the design and operation of drought MEW systems as part of a wider international project including parallel events in the United States and Australia. We highlight key themes for MEW design and use: types of droughts, indicators and impacts, uncertainty, capacity and decision-making, communications, and governance. We shed light on the complexity of drought through the multiple framings of the problem by different actors, and how this influences their needs for MEW. Our findings suggest that MEW systems need to embrace this complexity and strive for consistent messaging while also tailoring information for a wide range of audiences in terms of the drought characteristics, temporal and spatial scales, and impacts that are important for their particular decision-making processes. We end with recommendations to facilitate this approach.

Nodes must cooperate in the multi-hop routing process. This dynamic and open nature make reconfigurable networks vulnerable to routing attacks that could degrade significantly network performance. Intrusion detection systems consist of a set of techniques designed to identify hostile behavior. In this paper, there are several approaches for intrusion detection in reconfigurable network routing such as collaborative, statistical, or machine learning-based techniques. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to intrusion detection for reconfigurable network routing based on linear systems theory. Using this approach, we can discriminate routing attacks by considering the system's z-plane poles. The z-plane can be thought of as a two dimensional feature space that arises naturally. It is independent of the number of network attack detection metrics and does not require extra dimensionality reduction. Two different host-based intrusion detection techniques, inspired by this new linear systems perspective, are presented and analyzed through a case study. The case study considers the effects of attack severity and node mobility to the attack detection performance. High attack detection accuracy was obtained without increasing packet overhead for both techniques by analyzing locally available information.

We developed a multidimensional clinical reasoning form (CRF) to be used by physiotherapists in a psychologically informed practice training programme for low back pain. In this paper we describe the development of the CRF, how the CRF was used in the training, and present an evaluation of physiotherapists' perceptions of the CRF. Methods: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten physiotherapists purposively sampled in primary care. Data were gathered through pre, and post training focus group interviews and a secondary analysis of individual physiotherapist interviews conducted after the training. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data and capture the emergent themes.Results: Two main themes emerged before the training: (1) the CRF 'needs formal training' and (2) 'lacked instruction'. Three main themes emerged after the training (1) it provided 'a helpful framework for multidimensional clinical reasoning' (2) the CRF, and accompanying operational definitions, helped physiotherapists 'elicit information, with 'question prompts' helpful in facilitating patient disclosure (3) 'Utility' - although the CRF was not formally used by the physiotherapists it provided a conceptual reasoning framework to work from with more challenging patients.Conclusion: The CRF was not designed to be used in isolation by clinicians without training. However, when used as a training adjunct it appears to be valued by physiotherapists to help develop their critical thinking and better characterise patients' presentations in order to personalise care from a bio-psychosocial perspective.

Methods: A multiple case study of three men, involving quantitative and qualitative data, was used in an embedded mixed methods design and presented in three narrative stories. To capture differences and similarities in the use of MDs a cross-case analysis was conducted. Results: The findings show that the devices were important for retaining independence in everyday life and for participation in social activities. Use of MDs impacted on everyday activities by enabling, restricting, or changing the performance. Planning and careful thinking were new strategies developed for managing everyday life. The devices were purchased, received from relatives, or prescribed by professionals at a time point when there was a need. The function and form of the devices and a supportive environment were considered important for optimal use. Conclusions: These narrative stories nurture our understanding of complex and multifaceted aspects impacting on MD use in everyday life for very old men. To support active ageing, occupational therapists and other health professionals need to seek information on personal needs and expectations, in order to understand individual perspectives on MD use.

Aim To explore the experiences of adolescents with eczema and psoriasis with healthcare professionals, and to distil the participants' key messages for their healthcare providers. Design This is a secondary thematic analysis of interviews with adolescents with eczema or psoriasis. Participants There were a total of 41 text transcripts of interviews with young people with eczema or psoriasis who had given permission for secondary analysis; 23 of the participants had eczema, and 18 psoriasis. Participants were living in the UK at time of interview, and aged 15-24 years old. Results We have distilled the following key messages from young people with eczema and psoriasis for healthcare providers: (1) address the emotional impact; (2) give more information, with the subtheme and (3) appreciate patient research. We identified the following eczema-specific themes: (ECZ-4) 'It's not taken seriously'; (ECZ-5) offer choice in treatment and (ECZ-6) lack of structure/conflicting advice. Two psoriasis-specific themes were identified: (PSO-4) feeling dehumanised/treat me as a person; and (PSO-5) think about how treatments will affect daily life. Conclusion This qualitative data analysis highlights the need for greater recognition of the emotional impact of skin disease in adolescence, and for more comprehensive provision of information about the conditions. We call for greater sensitivity and flexibility in our approach to adolescents with skin disease, with important implications for healthcare delivery to this group.

J	Schweik, CM; Stepanov, A; Grove, JM				Schweik, CM; Stepanov, A; Grove, JM			The open research system: a web-based metadata and data repository for collaborative research	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th World Forestry Congress	SEP 21-28, 2003	Quebec City, CANADA			group collaboration; metadata management; online database; open source; open content licensing	COMPUTER-NETWORKS; COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION; SCIENCE	Beginning in 1999, a web-based metadata and data repository we call the "open research system" (ORS) was designed and built to assist geographically distributed scientific research teams. The purpose of this innovation was to promote the open sharing of data within and across organizational lines and across geographic distances. As the use of the system continued, end users and group administrators requested the development of a second, Intranet-based system with similar functionality. After three years of operation, a survey was conducted of users of the system to understand why some users and research groups appeared to utilize the two systems more than others. From this research we found that some barriers to use include: (1) mismatch of system functionality to user or group needs; (2) willingness to share with an internal group by Intranet but not with the world by Internet; and (3) resistance to entering metadata because of workplace habits. This experience has also taught us that with respect to web-based metadata and data repositories there is a difference between long-term and short-term research projects in their need to establish good metadata and data storage procedures. Moreover, some time is required for researchers to change from short-term to long-term project thinking. It is also important for organizations or managers of such research groups to reflect on established incentives and penalties that either encourage or discourage appropriate use of metadata in filing procedures. We conclude with a discussion of possible improvements that will be made to the system in the coming years, with an emphasis on the emerging phenomenon of "open content" (OC) collaboration that is being modeled after Internet-based collaboration in "open source" (OS) programming. This development will require online systems like ORS, and the OS/OC approach has the potential to evolve into no less than a new paradigm for how cross-organizational (in fact, global) scientific research collaborations are undertaken in the future.

However, little is known about how employees use these new capabilities, thus leading to performance variation. Drawing on a rich dataset from an ESM platform built in a Chinese high-tech company, this paper uses Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to examine how employees build their social networks on ESM platforms with the visibility affordance of ESM. The results reveal that (1) employees' networking behaviours on ESM platforms are limited by formal organisational boundaries such as department and hierarchical positions, and they tend to reproduce their working structures rather than to build new ties across horizontal and vertical boundaries enabled by ESM; (2) employees' networking behaviours are more likely to be influenced by their positions in formal hierarchy than by their informal hierarchies derived from their interactions on ESM; and (3) employees use ESM to reinforce their natural networking tendencies, including preferential attachment, closure and homophily. These findings extend our understandings of employees' social networking behaviours on ESM platforms and provide insights for managers to make better decisions on the design and implementation of ESM thus to achieve the expected benefits.

Methods This multiple-case ethnomethodological qualitative research study, included mothers admitted for a threatened premature delivery between 20 0/7 and 26 6/7 weeks gestation, the father, and the staff neonatologist conducting the clinical antenatal consultation. Content analysis of an audiotaped post-antenatal consultation interview with parents obtained their satisfaction scores as well as their comments on physician actions that facilitated their desired participation. Results Five cases, each called a "system-infant at risk", included 10 parents and 6 neonatologists. From the interviews emerged a blueprint for action by physicians, including communication strategies that parents say facilitated their participation in decision making; such as building trustworthy physician-parent relationships, providing "balanced" information, offering choices, and allowing time to think. Conclusion Parent descriptions indicate that the opportunity to participate to their satisfaction in the clinical antenatal consultation depends on how the physician interacts with them. Practice implications The parent-identified communication strategies facilitate shared decision making regarding treatment in the best interest of the infant at risk to be born at the limit of viability.

In particular, astrocytes, the main type of glial cells in the cortex, have been shown to communicate with neurons and with each other. They are thought to form a gap-junction-coupled syncytium supporting cell-cell communication via propagating Ca2+ waves. An identified mode of propagation is based on cytoplasm-to-cytoplasm transport of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) through gap junctions that locally trigger Ca2+ pulses via IP3-dependent Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. It is, however, currently unknown whether this intracellular route is able to support the propagation of long-distance regenerative Ca2+ waves or is restricted to short-distance signaling. Furthermore, the influence of the intracellular signaling dynamics on intercellular propagation remains to be understood. In this work, we propose a model of the gap-junctional route for intercellular Ca2+ wave propagation in astrocytes. Our model yields two major predictions. First, we show that long-distance regenerative signaling requires nonlinear coupling in the gap junctions. Second, we show that even with nonlinear gap junctions, long-distance regenerative signaling is favored when the internal Ca2+ dynamics implements frequency modulation-encoding oscillations with pulsating dynamics, while amplitude modulation-encoding dynamics tends to restrict the propagation range. As a result, spatially heterogeneous molecular properties and/or weak couplings are shown to give rise to rich spatiotemporal dynamics that support complex propagation behaviors. These results shed new light on the mechanisms implicated in the propagation of Ca2+ waves across astrocytes and the precise conditions under which glial cells may participate in information processing in the brain.

A survey sponsored by the Department of Health of Taiwan was conducted and the target subjects were every hospital in Taiwan (486 in total). The survey topics included testing of RFID interference with medical devices and perceptions of safety issues of RFID. The main targets of the survey were the Chief Information Officers (CIOs) or the main person responsible for RFID systems in each hospital. Of the original 486 questionnaires mailed, 273 were returned. A return rate of 56.17% was obtained. The survey results revealed that only six hospitals had carried out tests on interference by RFID with medical devices, and the results of these tests indicated that RFID does not interfere with medical devices. A majority of hospitals understood that RFID may interfere with medical devices but did not think that this would seriously harm patients. The application of RFID in the healthcare industry is certainly promising; however, EMI issues must be appropriately handled. This study asserts that most hospitals do not understand or pay insufficient attention to the issue of RFID interference with patient safety or medical devices. In addition, most hospitals believe that the problem of RFID should be resolved by RFID vendors. Therefore, this study argues that medical institutions should develop more understanding of RFID issues and that more attention should be given to the potential problems of RFID interference when developing RFID applications.

In 2014, schizophrenia was renamed in Mandarin in Taiwan, from the old name of "mind-splitting disease" to new name "disorder with dysfunction of thought and perception", in an attempt to reduce the stigmatization of schizophrenia. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the effects of renaming schizophrenia on its stigma in nursing students. We examined the public stigma, self-stigma, and social distance associated with schizophrenia and compared them before and after the renaming. Basic demographic data and previous contact experience were collected, and participants completed a modified Attribution Questionnaire, the Perceived Psychiatric Stigma Scale, and modified Social Distance Scale. The final sample comprised 99 participants. Assessment revealed that the renaming significantly reduced public stigma, self-stigma, and social distance. Regarding the old and new names for schizophrenia, the fourth-year nursing students scored significantly higher on public stigma and self-stigma than did the first-year students. Personal exposure to individuals diagnosed with mental disorders reduced public stigma toward schizophrenia. The study findings suggest that the renaming of schizophrenia reduced its associated stigma. Providing accurate information, instruction by qualified tutors, as well as exposure to patients in acute exacerbation in hospital settings and recovered patients in the community are important. Further studies with longitudinal design, participants from diverse backgrounds, and larger sample sizes to investigate the effect of renaming on the stigma toward schizophrenia are warranted.

Investigating the role of model-based reasoning while troubleshooting an electric circuit	PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH			English	Article							ORIENTED WORKED EXAMPLES; INTRODUCTORY ELECTRICITY; INFORMATION PRESENTATION; CURRICULUM-DEVELOPMENT; CONCURRENT; DESIGN; GUIDE; GOALS	We explore the overlap of two nationally recognized learning outcomes for physics lab courses, namely, the ability to model experimental systems and the ability to troubleshoot a malfunctioning apparatus. Modeling and troubleshooting are both nonlinear, recursive processes that involve using models to inform revisions to an apparatus. To probe the overlap of modeling and troubleshooting, we collected audiovisual data from think-aloud activities in which eight pairs of students from two institutions attempted to diagnose and repair a malfunctioning electrical circuit. We characterize the cognitive tasks and model-based reasoning that students employed during this activity. In doing so, we demonstrate that troubleshooting engages students in the core scientific practice of modeling.	[Dounas-Frazer, Dimitri R.; Lewandowski, H.

An <i>in vivo</i> investigation of first spike latencies in the inferior colliculus in response to multichannel penetrating auditory brainstem implant stimulation	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							VENTRAL COCHLEAR NUCLEUS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; TEMPORAL RESOLUTION; 1ST-SPIKE LATENCY; NERVE FIBERS; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; NEURONAL EXCITABILITY; AFFERENT-PROJECTIONS; BINAURAL INTERACTION; LATERAL LEMNISCUS	The cochlear nucleus (CN) is the first auditory processing site within the brain and the target location of the auditory brainstem implant (ABI), which provides speech perception to patients who cannot benefit from a cochlear implant (CI). Although there is variance between ABI recipient speech performance outcomes, performance is typically low compared to CI recipients. Temporal aspects of neural firing such as first spike latency (FSL) are thought to code for many speech features; however, no studies have investigated FSL from CN stimulation. Consequently, ABIs currently do not incorporate CN-specific temporal information. We therefore systematically investigated inferior colliculus (IC) neuron's FSL response to frequency-specific electrical stimulation of the CN in rats. The range of FSLs from electrical stimulation of many neurons indicates that both monosynaptic and polysynaptic pathways were activated, suggesting initial activation of multiple CN neuron types. Electrical FSLs for a single neuron did not change irrespective of the CN frequency region stimulated, indicating highly segregated projections from the CN to the IC. These results present the first evidence of temporal responses to frequency-specific CN electrical stimulation. Understanding the auditory system's temporal response to electrical stimulation will help in future ABI designs and stimulation strategies.

Social media and drug resistance in nursing training: Using a Twitterchat to develop an international community of practice for antimicrobial resistance	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						drug resistance; global; microbial; nursing; social media; Twitter		Aims and objectives To assess the impact of a Twitterchat focusing on antimicrobial resistance and it is feasibility for integration within a nursing prelicensure research methods class. Background Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest threats to global health and food security. Consequently, developing a global approach with large outreach is critical. Twitter, as a popular social media platform, is useful for creating communities of practice and communities of interest. Design A case study design using a Twitterchat is a hosted, convened and focussed discussion on a particular topic using a discrete hashtag. Method Using a standardised protocol, a Twitterchat was undertaken over a 24-hr period and digital metrics assessed at 72 hr. A summary of impact was undertaken using an online tool provided by Union Metrics (). Conclusions At 72 hr, 2,632,762 accounts were reached and over 10 million impressions achieved. Twitterchats can be useful in creating awareness and fostering a community of interest and demonstrating the role of nurses in thought leadership. A formalised research study will draw on this case study to evaluate the impact on the Twitter participants and nursing students. Relevance to clinical practice Social media are an accessible and useful tool to harness focus and attention on clinical issues with global relevance. Demonstrating the utility and leverage to nursing students is important in increasing their understanding of the importance of communication and diffusion of information.

Design Cross-sectional online survey. Setting UK. Participants The final sample was 1766 young adult smokers, with 50.3% male and 71.6% white British. To meet the inclusion criteria, participants had to be 16-34 years old and smoke factory-made cigarettes. Primary and secondary outcome measures Salience of inserts, perceptions of inserts as information provision, perceptions of inserts on quitting, support for inserts and perceived appeal, harm and trial of three cigarettes (a standard cigarette, a standard cigarette displaying the warning Smoking kills' and a green cigarette). Results Half the sample indicated that they would read inserts with three-fifths indicating that they are a good way to provide information about quitting (61%). Just over half indicated that inserts would make them think more about quitting (53%), help if they decided to quit (52%), are an effective way of encouraging smokers to quit (53%) and supported having them in all packs (55%). Participants who smoked factory-made cigarettes and other tobacco products (compared with exclusive factory-made cigarette smokers), had made a quit attempt within the last 6months (compared with those that had never made a quit attempt) or were likely to make a successful quit attempt in the next 6months (compared with those unlikely to make a quit attempt in the next 6months) were more likely to indicate that inserts could assist with cessation. Multivariable logistic regression modelling suggested that compared with the standard cigarette, the cigarette with warning (adjusted OR=17.71; 95%CI 13.75 to 22.80) and green cigarette (adjusted OR=30.88; 95%CI 23.98 to 39.76) were much less desirable (less appealing, more harmful and less likely to be tried). Conclusions Inserts and dissuasive cigarettes offer policy makers additional ways of using the pack to reduce smoking.

However, scale and anonymity mean that researchers often cannot directly get permission from users to collect and analyze their social media data. This article applies the basic ethical principle of respect for persons to consider individuals' perceptions of acceptable uses of data. We compare individuals' perceptions of acceptable uses of other types of sensitive data, such as health records and individual identifiers, with their perceptions of acceptable uses of social media data. Our survey of 1018 people shows that individuals think of their social media data as moderately sensitive and agree that it should be protected. Respondents are generally okay with researchers using their data in social research but prefer that researchers clearly articulate benefits and seek explicit consent before conducting research. We argue that researchers must ensure that their research provides social benefits worthy of individual risks and that they must address those risks throughout the research process.

These nanoparticle architectures could offer tailored properties due to collective effects, but developing a general platform for fabricating such clusters is a significant challenge. Here, we report a strategy for assembling three-dimensional nanoparticle clusters that uses a molecular frame designed with encoded vertices for particle placement. The frame is a DNA origami octahedron and can be used to fabricate clusters with various symmetries and particle compositions. Cryo-electron microscopy is used to uncover the structure of the DNA frame and to reveal that the nanoparticles are spatially coordinated in the prescribed manner. We show that the DNA frame and one set of nanoparticles can be used to create nanoclusters with different chiroptical activities. We also show that the octahedra can serve as programmable interparticle linkers, allowing one-and two-dimensional arrays to be assembled with designed particle arrangements.

Tailoring virtual human-delivered interventions: A digital intervention promoting colorectal cancer screening for Black women	PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY			English	Article						colorectal neoplasms; cues; early detection of cancer; health communication; internet-based intervention; oncology; psycho-oncology; qualitative research	DISPARITIES	Objective: Despite efforts to reduce cancer disparities, Black women remain underrepresented in cancer research. Virtual health assistants (VHAs) are one promising digital technology for communicating health messages and promoting health behaviors to diverse populations. This study describes participant responses to a VHA-delivered intervention promoting colorectal cancer (CRC) screening with a home-stool test. Methods: We recruited 53 non-Hispanic Black women 50 to 73 years old to participate in focus groups and think-aloud interviews and test a web-based intervention delivered by a race-and gender-concordant VHA. A user-centered design approach prioritized modifications to three successive versions of the intervention based on participants' comments. Results: Participants identified 26 cues relating to components of the VHA's credibility, including trustworthiness, expertise, and authority. Comments on early versions revealed preferences for communicating with a human doctor and negative critiques of the VHA's appearance and movements. Modifications to specific cues improved the user experience, and participants expressed increased willingness to engage with later versions of the VHA and the screening messages it delivered. Informed by the Modality, Agency, Interactivity, Navigability Model, we present a framework for developing credible VHA-delivered cancer screening messages. Conclusions: VHAs provide a systematic way to deliver health information. A culturally sensitive intervention designed for credibility promoted user interest in engaging with guideline-concordant CRC screening messages. We present strategies for effectively using cues to engage audiences with health messages, which can be applied to future research in varying contexts.

No data existed prior to the present study to substantiate these threats. We investigated the rates, spatial distribution and causes of conflict and hunting through an interview-based survey in the orangutan's range in Kalimantan, Indonesia. Between April 2008 and September 2009, we interviewed 6983 respondents in 687 villages to obtain socio-economic information, assess knowledge of local wildlife in general and orangutan encounters specifically, and to query respondents about their knowledge on orangutan conflicts and killing, and relevant laws. This survey revealed estimated killing rates of between 750 and 1800 animals killed in the last year, and between 1950 and 3100 animals killed per year on average within the lifetime of the survey respondents. These killing rates are higher than previously thought and are high enough to pose a serious threat to the continued existence of orangutans in Kalimantan. Importantly, the study contributes to our understanding of the spatial variation in threats, and the underlying causes of those threats, which can be used to facilitate the development of targeted conservation management.

When a protein experiences a changed environment, it is under strong selection to find a peak in the new fitness landscape. It has been shown that strong selection increases epistatic interactions as well as the ruggedness of the fitness landscape, but little is known about how the epistatic interactions change under selection in the long-term evolution of a protein. Here we analyze the evolution of epistasis in the protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) using protease sequences collected for almost a decade from both treated and untreated patients, to understand how epistasis changes and how those changes impact the long-term evolvability of a protein. We use an information-theoretic proxy for epistasis that quantifies the co-variation between sites, and show that positive information is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition that detects epistasis in most cases. We analyze the "fossils" of the evolutionary trajectories of the protein contained in the sequence data, and show that epistasis continues to enrich under strong selection, but not for proteins whose environment is unchanged. The increase in epistasis compensates for the information loss due to sequence variability brought about by treatment, and facilitates adaptation in the increasingly rugged fitness landscape of treatment. While epistasis is thought to enhance evolvability via valley-crossing early-on in adaptation, it can hinder adaptation later when the landscape has turned rugged. However, we find no evidence that the HIV-1 protease has reached its potential for evolution after 9 years of adapting to a drug environment that itself is constantly changing. We suggest that the mechanism of encoding new information into pairwise interactions is central to protein evolution not just in HIV-1 protease, but for any protein adapting to a changing environment.

Medial frontal cortex response to unexpected motivationally salient outcomes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Medial frontal cortex; Prediction errors; Motivation; Reward; Punishment; Event-related potentials	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; REWARD PREDICTION ERROR; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; NEURAL SYSTEM; BRAIN POTENTIALS; THETA; DOPAMINE; LOCALIZATION	The medial frontal cortex (MFC) plays a central role allocating resources to process salient information, in part by responding to prediction errors. While there is some recent debate, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) is thought to index a reward prediction error by signaling outcomes that are worse than expected. A recent study utilizing electric shock provided data inconsistent with these accounts and reported that the omission of both appetitive (money) and aversive outcomes (electric shocks) elicited a medial frontal negativity. These data suggest that the ERPs within this time range support a salience prediction error that responds to unexpected events regardless of valence. To compare the reward and salience prediction error models, we employed a design that delivered both appetitive (monetary) and aversive (noise burst) outcomes. Participants completed a passive S1/S2 prediction design where Si predicted S2 with 80% accuracy and S2 predicted the outcome with 100% accuracy. We compared both earlier and later ERP responses over the medial frontal cortex to compare the salience and reward prediction hypotheses. Considering both time windows, the ERP response to S2 in the early time window was most positive when S2 signaled that an outcome was unexpectedly delivered and in the later time window, was most negative when an outcome was unexpectedly withheld, regardless of outcome valence. Thus, these results are more consistent with a salience prediction error rather than a reward prediction error.

The materials were hypothesized to support student learning of histopathology concepts by facilitating "dual coding" of the content, since they provide both visual and verbal information. Second- and fourth-year professional veterinary students were surveyed about their perceptions of the effectiveness, efficiency, and appeal of the online modules. A historical comparison of final grades in the second-year pathology course, "Biology of Disease," was conducted to evaluate the impact of the materials on academic outcomes. Think-aloud interviews were conducted with the fourth-year students in which the researcher observed the students interacting with the materials and asked them to "tell me what you're thinking as you use the modules." Survey results show that the only area in which the two student groups quantitatively rated the materials differently was their perception of how the materials complemented their learning. In contrast, the qualitative data indicate that advanced students used and perceived the materials differently, perhaps because of their greater metacognitive skills and pre-existing knowledge. We concluded that these findings can be attributed to the manner in which students approached the materials: the fourth-year students felt the materials were less relevant because they did not directly correspond to cases they were seeing, while the second-year students appreciated their relevance to topics in the pathology course. There was no significant difference in final exam performance for the group of students that used the supplemental online modules and the prior four years' classes, who did not have access to the materials. Overall, this study demonstrated that it is possible to create a set of materials to be used by multiple audiences, provided the needs of each group are taken into consideration during the design process.

Self-management of chronic diseases is essential to improve health behaviours and health outcomes. Technology-assisted interventions have shown to improve self-management of chronic diseases. Virtual avatars can be a key factor for the acceptance of these technologies. Addison Care is a home-based telecare solution equipped with a virtual avatar named Addison, connecting older persons with their caregivers via an easy-to-use technology. A central advantage is that Addison Care provides access to self-management support for an up-to-now highly under-represented population-older persons with chronic disease(s), which enables them to profit from e-health in everyday life. Methods and analysis A pragmatic, non-randomised, one-arm pilot study applying an embedded mixed-methods approach will be conducted to examine user experience, usability and user engagement of the virtual avatar Addison. Participants will be at least 65 years and will be recruited between September 2022 and November 2022 from hospitals during the discharge process to home care. Standardised instruments, such as the User Experience Questionnaire, System Usability Scale, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale, Short-Form-8-Questionnaire, UCLA Loneliness Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Stendal Adherence with Medication Score and Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Diseases Scale, as well as survey-based assessments, semistructured interviews and think-aloud protocols, will be used. The study seeks to enrol 20 patients that meet the criteria. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol has been approved by the ethic committee of the German Society for Nursing Science (21-037). The results are intended to be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated through conference papers.

Despite this potential, relatively little attention has been paid to a key step in data reuse: the behaviours involved in datacentric sensemaking. We aim to address this gap by presenting a mixed-methods study combining in-depth interviews, a think-aloud task and a screen recording analysis with 31 researchers from different disciplines as they summarised and interacted with both familiar and unfamiliar data. We use our findings to identify and detail common patterns of data-centric sensemaking across three clusters of activities that we present as a framework: inspecting data, engaging with content, and placing data within broader contexts. Additionally, we propose design recommendations for tools and documentation practices, which can be used to facilitate sensemaking and subsequent data reuse.

The knowledge graph describes the domain-specific knowledge regarding entities and interrelationships related to a manufacturing setting. It also contains information on possible decision-making options that can assist decision-makers, such as planners or logisticians. This paper proposes a knowledge graph modelling approach to construct actionable cognitive twins for capturing specific knowledge related to production planning and demand forecasting in a manufacturing plant. The knowledge graph provides semantic descriptions and contextualisation of the production lines and processes, including data identification and simulation or artificial intelligence algorithms and forecasts used to support them. Such semantics provide ground for inferencing, relating different knowledge types: creative, deductive, definitional, and inductive. To develop the knowledge graph models for describing the use case thoroughly, systems thinking approach is proposed to design and verify the ontology, develop a knowledge graph and build an actionable cognitive twin. Finally, we evaluate our approach in two use cases developed for a European original equipment manufacturer related to the automotive industry as part of the European Horizon 2020 project FACTLOG.

They originate by a mechanism of overprinting, in which point mutations in an existing frame allow the expression (the "birth") of a completely new protein from a second frame. In viruses, in which overlapping genes are abundant, these new proteins often play a critical role in infection, yet they are frequently overlooked during genome annotation. This results in erroneous interpretation of mutational studies and in a significant waste of resources. Therefore, overlapping genes need to be correctly detected, especially since they are now thought to be abundant also in eukaryotes. Developing better detection methods and conducting systematic evolutionary studies require a large, reliable benchmark dataset of known cases. We thus assembled a high-quality dataset of 80 viral overlapping genes whose expression is experimentally proven. Many of them were not present in databases. We found that overall, overlapping genes differ significantly from non-overlapping genes in their nucleotide and amino acid composition. In particular, the proteins they encode are enriched in high-degeneracy amino acids and depleted in low-degeneracy ones, which may alleviate the evolutionary constraints acting on overlapping genes. Principal component analysis revealed that the vast majority of overlapping genes follow a similar composition bias, despite their heterogeneity in length and function. Six proven mammalian overlapping genes also followed this bias. We propose that this apparently near-universal composition bias may either favour the birth of overlapping genes, or/and result from selection pressure acting on them.

Two Heads May Be Better Than One: Learning From Computer Agents in Conversational Trialogues	TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD			English	Article							NATURAL-LANGUAGE; AUTOTUTOR; DIALOGUE; QUESTION; INFORMATION; TUTOR; GAME	Background: Pedagogical agents are computerized talking heads or embodied animated avatars that help students learn by performing actions and holding conversations with the students in natural language. Dialogues occur between a tutor agent and the student in the case of AutoTutor and other intelligent tutoring systems with natural-language conversation. The agents are adaptive to the students' actions, verbal contributions, and, in some systems, their emotions (such as boredom, confusion, and frustration). Focus of Study: This paper explores several designs of trialogues (two agents interacting with a human student) that have been productively implemented for particular students, subject matters, and depths of learning. The two agents take on different roles, but often serve as peers and tutors. There are different trialogue designs that address different pedagogical goals for different classes of students. For example, students can (a) observe vicariously two agents interacting, (b) converse with a tutor agent while a peer agent periodically chimes in, or (c) teach a peer agent while a tutor rescues a problematic interaction. In addition, agents can argue with each other over issues and ask what the human student thinks about the argument. Research Design: Trialogues have been developed for systematic experimental investigations in several studies that measure student impressions, learning gains from pretest to post-test on objective tests, and both cognitive and affective states during learning. The studies compare conditions with different pedagogical principles underlying the trialogues in order to assess the impact of these principles on student impressions, learning, emotions, and other psychological measures. Discourse analyses are performed on the language and actions in the log files in order to assess their impacts on psychological measures. Recommendations: Tests of these agent-based systems have shown improvements in learning gains and systematic influences on student emotions. In the future, researchers need to conduct more research to empirically evaluate the psychological impact of different trialogue designs on psychological measures. These trialogue designs range from scripted interactions between agents being observed by the student, to the student helping a fellow peer agent, to the student resolving an argument between two agents. The central question is whether the learning experiences and outcomes show improvement over typical human-computer dialogues (i.e., one human and one tutor agent) and conventional pedagogical interventions.

The state of knowledge on biogenesis, molecular content and horizontal communication of diverse types of cancer EVs has expanded considerably in recent years. As a consequence, a plethora of information about EV composition and molecular function has emerged, along with the notion that cancer cells rely on these particles to invade tissues and propagate oncogenic signals at distance. The number of in vivo studies, designed to achieve a deeper understanding of the extent to which EV biology can be applied to clinically relevant settings, is rapidly growing. This review summarizes recent studies on cancer-derived EV functions, with an overview about biogenesis and molecular cargo of exosomes, microvesicles and large oncosomes. We also discuss current challenges and emerging technologies that might improve EV detection in various biological systems. Further studies on the functional role of EVs in specific steps of cancer formation and progression will expand our understanding of the diversity of paracrine signaling mechanisms in malignant growth.

J	Zhao, CH; Chen, JH; Jing, H				Zhao, Chunhui; Chen, Junhao; Jing, Hua			Condition-Driven Data Analytics and Monitoring for Wide-Range Nonstationary and Transient Continuous Processes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Monitoring; Transient analysis; Steady-state; Data models; Machine learning; Data analysis; Adaptation models; Bayesian inference-based distance (BID); condition slices; Gaussian mixture model (GMM); slow feature analysis (SFA); temporal analytics; transient process; wide-range nonstationarity	SLOW FEATURE ANALYSIS; INDUSTRIAL-PROCESSES; QUALITY PREDICTION; FAULT-DETECTION; COINTEGRATION; DIAGNOSIS; STRATEGY	Frequent and wide changes in operation conditions are quite common in real process industry, resulting in typical wide-range nonstationary and transient characteristics along time direction. The considerable challenge is, thus, how to solve the conflict between the learning model accuracy and change complexity for analysis and monitoring of nonstationary and transient continuous processes. In this work, a novel condition-driven data analytics method is developed to handle this problem. A condition-driven data reorganization strategy is designed which can neatly restore the time-wise nonstationary and transient process into different condition slices, revealing similar process characteristics within the same condition slice. Process analytics can then be conducted for the new analysis unit. On the one hand, coarse-grained automatic condition-mode division is implemented with slow feature analysis to track the changing operation characteristics along condition dimension. On the other hand, fine-grained distribution evaluation is performed for each condition mode with Gaussian mixture model. Bayesian inference-based distance (BID) monitoring indices are defined which can clearly indicate the fault effects and distinguish different operation scenarios with meaningful physical interpretation. A case study on a real industrial process shows the feasibility of the proposed method which, thus, can be generalized to other continuous processes with typical wide-range nonstationary and transient characteristics along time direction. Note to Practitioners-Industrial processes in general have nonstationary characteristics which are ubiquitous in real world data, often reflected by a time-variant mean, a time-variant autocovariance, or both resulting from various factors. The focus of this study is to develop a universal analytics and monitoring method for wide-range nonstationary and transient continuous processes. Condition-driven concept takes the place of time-driven thought. For the first time, it is recognized that there are similar process characteristics within the same condition slice and changes in the process correlations may relate to its condition modes. Besides, the proposed method can provide enhanced physical interpretation for the monitoring results with concurrent analysis of the static and dynamic information which carry different information, analogous to the concepts of "position" and "velocity" in physics, respectively. The static information can tell the current operation condition, while the dynamic information can clarify whether the process status is switching between different steady states. It is noted that the condition-driven concept is universal and can be extended to other applications for industrial manufacturing applications.

Nurses' Expectations of an Inpatient Portal for Hospitalized Patients and Caregivers	APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						patient portal; inpatient; implementation; expectations; nurses and staff personnel	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; HEALTH; PERCEPTIONS; EXPERIENCES; ACTIVATION; RECORDS	Background Patient portals are intended to engage patients and enhance patient-centered care. Recent studies suggest that the information within portals could provide benefits to patients and their caregivers during hospitalization; however, few studies have examined nurse and staff expectations of portals when used in the hospital setting. Objective This article examines inpatient nurse and support staff expectations of a commercially available inpatient portal prior to its hospital-wide implementation. Methods In this cross-sectional study, nurses and support staff were surveyed 1 month prior to the implementation of an inpatient portal for patients. Items included respondent characteristics, satisfaction with online inpatient portal training, expectations of the effects of portal use on patients, caregivers, and staff, overall acceptance, and barriers to its implementation. Results Of 881 respondents, 73.0% were staff nurses, 18.4% nurse assistants, 4.3% unit coordinators, and 1.2% nurse managers. Respondents were generally satisfied with the portal information they received from online training. A majority liked the portal to some extent prior to its use (66.7%); however, they noted multiple implementation barriers, including: tablets would get lost/damaged (66.2% of respondents), patients and/or caregivers would have too many questions (48.5%), and staff would have problems integrating it into their workflow (44.7%). Respondents working on medical units had higher expectations ( p < 0.001) and acceptance ( p < 0.01) of the portal than those on surgical and intensive care units. Nurse managers were more positive than respondents with other job roles were (all p < 0.001). Conclusion Overall, nurse and support staff had high expectations of the effects of inpatient portal use prior to its hospital-wide implementation. They thought it would benefit patients and/or their caregivers; however, they also perceived several barriers to its implementation.

In this study, we proposed a new algorithm called the fuzzy control traceability (FCT) to track odor plumes. Our proposed algorithm combined the characteristics and fuzzy control of the UAV and designed a controller based on the actual environment of the UAV. The fuzzy controller fuzzed the input gas concentration information, established fuzzy control rules by imitating human brain thinking, and outputted the turning angle and the move length according to rules, thus realizing intelligent tracking of the odor plume by the UAV. We compared the FCT algorithm with the bio-inspired "ZigZag" algorithm to validate its performance. Various concentration fields were constructed, and ten sets of experiments are performed using the two algorithms in different concentration fields. The average success rate of the FCT algorithm under different concentration fields was 95.4% higher than that of the ZigZag algorithm. Implications: Fuzzy control logic is applied to the field of air pollutant traceability of drones, and a single drone traceability algorithm based on fuzzy control is proposed; and in view of the shortcomings of a single traceability subject in the traceability, multiple traceability subjects are introduced to optimize fuzzy control.

Usability testing of Avoiding Diabetes Thru Action Plan Targeting (ADAPT) decision support for integrating care-based counseling of pre-diabetes in an electronic health record	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Usability; Protocol-based care; Electronic health records; Clinical simulations; Behavioral change; Behavioral contracting; Patient counseling	DESIGN; IMPACT; BARRIERS; SYSTEM	Purpose: Usability testing can be used to evaluate human-computer interaction (HCI) and communication in shared decision making (SDM) for patient-provider behavioral change and behavioral contracting. Traditional evaluations of usability using scripted or mock patient scenarios with think-aloud protocol analysis provide a way to identify HCI issues. In this paper we describe the application of these methods in the evaluation of the Avoiding Diabetes Thru Action Plan Targeting (ADAPT) tool, and test the usability of the tool to support the ADAPT framework for integrated care counseling of pre-diabetes. The think-aloud protocol analysis typically does not provide an assessment of how patient-provider interactions are effected in "live" clinical workflow or whether a tool is successful. Therefore, "Near-live" clinical simulations involving applied simulation methods were used to compliment the think-aloud results. This complementary usability technique was used to test the end-user HCI and tool performance by more closely mimicking the clinical workflow and capturing interaction sequences along with assessing the functionality of computer module prototypes on clinician workflow. We expected this method to further complement and provide different usability findings as compared to think-aloud analysis. Together, this mixed method evaluation provided comprehensive and realistic feedback for iterative refinement of the ADAPT system prior to implementation. Methods: The study employed two phases of testing of a new interactive ADAPT tool that embedded an evidence-based shared goal setting component into primary care workflow for dealing with pre-diabetes counseling within a commercial physician office electronic health record (EHR). Phase I applied usability testing that involved "think-aloud" protocol analysis of eight primary care providers interacting with several scripted clinical scenarios. Phase II used "near-live" clinical simulations of five providers interacting with standardized trained patient actors enacting the clinical scenario of counseling for pre-diabetes, each of whom had a pedometer that recorded the number of steps taken over a week. In both phases, all sessions were audio-taped and motion screen-capture software was activated for onscreen recordings. Transcripts were coded using iterative qualitative content analysis methods. Results: In Phase I, the impact of the components and layout of ADAPT on user's Navigation, Understandability, and Workflow were associated with the largest volume of negative comments (i.e. approximately 80% of end-user commentary), while Usability and Content of ADAPT were representative of more positive than negative user commentary. The heuristic category of Usability had a positive-to-negative comment ratio of 2.1, reflecting positive perception of the usability of the tool, its functionality, and overall co-productive utilization of ADAPT. However, there were mixed perceptions about content (i.e., how the information was displayed, organized and described in the tool). In Phase II, the duration of patient encounters was approximately 10 min with all of the Patient Instructions (prescriptions) and behavioral contracting being activated at the end of each visit. Upon activation, providers accepted the pathway prescribed by the tool 100% of the time and completed all the fields in the tool in the simulation cases. Only 14% of encounter time was spent using the functionality of the ADAPT tool in terms of keystrokes and entering relevant data. The rest of the time was spent on communication and dialog to populate the patient instructions. In all cases, the interaction sequence of reviewing and discussing exercise and diet of the patient was linked to the functionality of the ADAPT tool in terms of monitoring, response-efficacy, self-efficacy, and negotiation in the patient provider dialog. There was a change from one-way dialog to two-way dialog and negotiation that ended in a behavioral contract. This change demonstrated the tool's sequence, which supported recording current exercise and diet followed by a diet and exercise goal setting procedure to reduce the risk of diabetes onset. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that "think-aloud" protocol analysis with "near-live" clinical simulations provided a successful usability evaluation of a new primary care pre-diabetes shared goal setting tool. Each phase of the study provided complementary observations on problems with the new onscreen tool and was used to show the influence of the ADAPT framework on the usability, workflow integration, and communication between the patient and provider. The think-aloud tests with the provider showed the tool can be used according to the ADAPT framework (exercise-to-diet behavior change and tool utilization), while the clinical simulations revealed the ADAPT framework to realistically support patient-provider communication to obtain behavioral change contract. SDM interactions and mechanisms affecting protocol-based care can be more completely captured by combining "near-live" clinical simulations with traditional "think-aloud analysis" which augments clinician utilization. More analysis is required to verify if the rich communication actions found in Phase II compliment clinical workflows. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Objective: This pilot study aimed to test the feasibility of a theoretically informed mobile health (mHealth) tool designed to reduce health disparities and facilitate human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among a sample of young MSM. Methods: The development of the mHealth tool was guided by previous research, implementation intention theory, and design thinking. We recruited MSM aged 18-26 years through a popular online dating app and linked participants to our mHealth tool, which provided HPV vaccine information and fostered access to care. Results: A total of 42 young MSM participated in this pilot study in Boston, Massachusetts. Participants reported variable HPV knowledge (ie, high knowledge of HPV risk factors and low knowledge of HPV-related cancer risks for men) and positive vaccine beliefs and attitudes. Of those who were either unvaccinated, not up to date, or did not report vaccine status, 23% (8/35) utilized the mHealth tool to obtain HPV vaccination. Participants primarily utilized the tool's (1) educational components and (2) capabilities facilitating concrete vaccine action plans. Conclusions: We recruited an underserved at-risk population of youth via an online dating app for our mHealth intervention that resulted in in-person health care delivery. This study was limited by enrollment challenges, including low willingness to download the mHealth tool to mobile devices.\	[Fontenot, Holly B.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Nursing & Dent Hyg, 2528 McCarthy Mall,Webster Hall 412, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Fontenot, Holly B.; Mayer, Kenneth H.] Fenway Inst, Boston, MA USA; [Fontenot, Holly B.; White, Bradley Patrick; Lacasse, Hailee] Boston Coll, Connell Sch Nursing, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Rosenberger, Joshua G.] Penn State Univ, Coll Hlth & Human Dev, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Rutirasiri, Chokdee] Proper Villains, Boston, MA USA; [Rutirasiri, Chokdee] Boston Coll, Sch Arts & Sci, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Mayer, Kenneth H.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Mayer, Kenneth H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA USA; [Zimet, Gregory] Indiana Univ, Sch Med, Div Adolescent Med, Indianapolis, IN USA	University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Boston College; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Boston College; Harvard University; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis	Fontenot, HB (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Nursing & Dent Hyg, 2528 McCarthy Mall,Webster Hall 412, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.	hbfont@hawaii.edu		Mayer, Kenneth/0000-0001-7460-733X; Zimet, Gregory/0000-0003-3835-937X; Fontenot, Holly/0000-0002-7864-9171	National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [R21 AI130447]; Indiana University Purdue University Center for HPV Research	National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)); Indiana University Purdue University Center for HPV Research	We would like to thank participants and the providers and staff of the Sidney Borum Jr Health Center of Fenway Health.

The advantages of using ATAC-seq include a small amount of material needed, fast protocol, and the ability to capture a range of gene regulatory elements with a single assay. With increasing interest in chromatin research, it is an imperative to have feasible, reliable assays that are compatible with a range of neuroscience study designs. Here we tested three protocols for neuronal chromatin accessibility analysis, including a varying brain tissue freezing method followed by fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) and ATAC-seq. Our study shows that the cryopreservation method impacts the number of open chromatin regions identified from frozen brain tissue using ATAC-seq. However, we show that all protocols generate consistent and robust data and enable the identification of functional regulatory elements in neuronal cells. Our study implies that the broad biological interpretation of chromatin accessibility data is not significantly affected by the freezing condition. We also reveal additional challenges of doing chromatin analysis on post-mortem human brain tissue. Overall, ATAC-seq coupled with FANS is a powerful method to capture cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility information in mouse and human brain. Our study provides alternative brain preservation methods that generate high-quality ATAC-seq data while fitting in different study designs, and further encourages the use of this method to uncover the role of epigenetic (dys)regulation in the brain.

In addition to being a reliable method for collecting and managing information, wireless networks (WNs) are capable of enhancing the performance of RE management. As a result of wireless data transfer risks and centralized power trades, SGs using WNs are unable to provide the security of the electricity market or ensure a high level of RE utilization. Blockchains (BCs), which are new technologies that enable data sharing, are gaining popularity, and it is thought to be able to address these issues. A BC-based, reliable power-exchange scheme is presented for SGs using WNs in this study. Using the BC for recording power data obtained from the WNs allows the smart contract for making appropriate trades according to the information. Energy trading and RE consumption are more efficient in a dual-chain architecture that consists of local energy trade BCs and RE trade BCs. A BC-based RE incentive framework is designed to have greater stability and scale among RE producers. Overall, the proposed technique not only can provide higher security and reliability to the system but also can mitigate fraud, as well as providing less operation cost for the system. Ultimately, the 56bus test feeder layout is used to validate the framework.& COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. on behalf of Journal of Innovation & Knowledge.

When considering nano-topography, these shapes are much smaller than the cell, but still strong responses to nano-topography have been seen. Filopodia, or microspikes, presented by cells at their leading edges are thought to be involved in gathering of special information. In order to investigate this, and to develop an understanding of what size of feature can be sensed by cells, morphological observation (electron and fluorescent microscopy) of fibroblasts reacting to nano-pits with 35, 75 and 120 nm diameters has been used in this study. The nano-pits are especially interesting because unlike many of the nanofeatures cited in the literature, they have no height for the cells to react to. The results showed that cell filopodia, and retraction fibres, interacted with all pit sizes, although direct interaction was hard to image on the 35 nm pits. This suggests that cells are extremely sensitive to their nanoevironment and that should be taken in to consideration when designing next-generation tissue engineering materials. We suggest that this may occur through nanocontact guidance as filopodia are moved over the pits. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Little is known, however, about how caregivers of people with ADRD think about or address firearm safety. Objective To assess views on firearm safety risks among caregivers of persons with ADRD, experiences of caregivers with health care professional-delivered counseling, and their preferred sources of information about firearm safety. Design, Setting, and Participants This survey study used a probability-based online survey (National Firearms Survey, July 30 to August 11, 2019) with weights used to generate nationally representative estimates of adults living in households with firearms to assess firearm safety views of English-speaking adults 35 years or older. Respondents for the National Firearm Survery were drawn from I KnowledgePanel, a frame with approximately 55 000 US adults selected on an ongoing basis using address-based sampling methods. Main Outcomes and Measures Caregivers were asked whether the person with ADRD owned or had access to firearms. Additional ADRD-related measures assessed perceptions about the likelihood of types of firearm injuries involving people with ADRD, support for firearm safety counseling by health care professionals with regard to dementia, and history of ever having received such counseling. Results Of 6712 invited panel members, 4030 completed the survey (completion rate, 65%). For this analysis, we excluded the youngest participants (aged 18-34 years; n = 498); among the remaining 3532 participants, 124 reported being caregivers for persons with ADRD. Of the 124 caregivers, 51% were female and the mean (SD) age was 60 (12.5) years. Most participants (71%; 95% CI, 69%-72%) thought that a person with ADRD was more likely to hurt someone else unintentionally than intentionally hurt themselves or someone else. Many participants thought health care professionals should always (45%; 95% CI, 43%-47%) or sometimes (34%; 95% CI, 32%-37%) talk about firearm safety with caregivers or patients with dementia, but only 5% of caregivers (95% CI, 2%-12%) reported that a health care professional had ever spoken to them about firearm safety. Among the 41% (95% CI, 31%-51%) of caregivers who lived with a person with dementia, 31% (95% CI, 18%-49%) said the person with dementia could access firearms in the home. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, few caregivers of adults with ADRD reported having received health care professional counseling about firearm safety, although most thought health care professionals should provide such counseling. These findings raise concerns about home firearm access among adults with ADRD and indicate potential opportunities for enhanced education by health care professionals and community organizations. This survey study of caregivers of people with Alzheimer disease and related dementias assesses caregiver views on firearm safety risks, experiences with health care professional-delivered counseling, and preferred sources of information about firearm safety. Question What proportion of adults living in homes with firearms are caregivers for people with Alzheimer disease and related dementias, and what are their characteristics, experiences, and preferences related to firearms? Findings In this survey study of US adults (aged >= 35 years) living in homes with firearms, 2.6% reported being caregivers of a person with Alzheimer disease and related dementias, and 41% of these caregivers lived with that person. Although most caregivers were open to health care professional counseling about firearm safety for persons with Alzheimer disease and related dementias, few caregivers had ever received any such counseling. Meaning The findings suggest that many community-dwelling adults with dementia have firearm access and that there may be a need for enhanced education and resources for their caregivers.

J	Wu, K; Yi, W; Niu, RQ; Wei, LF				Wu, Ke; Yi, Wang; Niu, Ruiqing; Wei, Lifei			Subpixel land cover change mapping with multitemporal remote-sensed images at different resolution	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						soft classification; subpixel mapping; cellular automata; changed detection	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; FRACTION IMAGES; PIXEL; ALGORITHM; SCALE	Due to the lack of support for a high-resolution image in a short time, land cover change detection is always applied on the multitemporal remote-sensed images with different resolutions. The coarse-resolution image contains a large number of mixed pixels, which can seriously limit the utility of the change detection. Soft classification (SC) can be applied to improve this situation through deriving the abundances and generating the fractional change map, but it cannot provide the spatial distribution of the subpixels. Subpixel mapping (SPM) is a potential solution to resolve this problem, and is designed to use the proportions to obtain a sharpened thematic map at a subpixel scale. Based on this thought, the subpixel scale land cover change mapping result can be realized by integrating these two key techniques. However, in practice, there is a serious limitation to the detail and accuracy of the result, because when the scale factor between the different resolution images is large, the subpixel configuration is complex and the data volumes will be amplified. Moreover, with the high proportion of the changed area in the whole image, the change detection process at the subpixel level gets more difficult. The SPM technique is generally performed based only on the abundances of each and the spatial dependence assumption, so it cannot satisfy the demand. In order to overcome this shortcoming, several new reasonable subpixel scale change detection rules are defined in this paper, which dictate the land cover change map must be constructed according to the existing high-resolution image. The output from SC and prior information of the subpixel feature arrangement is applied into a modified cellular automata (CA) model, which can be regarded as a more reasonable tool to monitor the subpixel changes to resolve the big-data problem. Two experiments are performed and the results prove that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of the change detection maps of the spatial distribution in a subpixel scale.

Social Position Influencing the Water Perception Gap Between Local Leaders and Constituents in a Socio-Hydrological System	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							PUBLIC PERCEPTION; RIVER-BASIN; RISK; MANAGEMENT; GOVERNANCE; POLITICS; QUALITY; SCIENCE	How well city leaders represent their constituents and meet their needs are key concerns in transitioning to local sustainable water governance. To date, however, there is little research documenting the influence of social position between elected leaders who make policy, career staff water managers who design and operate systems and implement policies, and the members of the public whose individual water use behaviors are important drivers of water sustainability outcomes. In this study, we ask: "How does social position explain variation in water perceptions and concerns between different actors in a socio-hydrological system?" Using a mixed method approach with survey and interview data, we explore the ways that positioning within the governance system, geographic context, and citizen engagement in local government mediate perceptions of the urban water system. Regardless of local biophysical water supply conditions, residents showed most concern about future water shortages and high water costs, while their leaders were consistently most concerned about deteriorating local water infrastructure. Further, constituents who received water-related information directly from public utility mailings or served on community committees and boards had perceptions that were more aligned with leaders' concerns. The importance of social structure over natural and built environments in shaping water issue perceptions underscores the value of social analysis in socio-hydrology studies. Further, practitioners looking to increase consensus for a transition to sustainable water governance might work to develop institutional mechanisms to increase opportunities for water user involvement in local water system governance. Plain Language Summary Do city leaders differ from the public on key water issues, and if so, why? We use surveys and interviews with urban Utah Mayors, City Council persons, public utilities staff, and residents to compare their concerns about the current and future water supply, water shortages, quality, cost, and infrastructure. We find that residents were more concerned about future water shortages and high water costs, while leaders were more concerned about deteriorating water infrastructure. This was the case no matter where cities were located or what their water source was. Leaders also thought that their relationship with their publics was largely reactive. The results suggest that socio-hydrology models that presume that actors in the social structure are equally and fully informed of the issues or would respond to cues in the same way may lead to oversimplified results. Where misaligned expectations between leaders and constituents result in unintended consequences, a greater attention to the values, norms, and attitudes held by different actors with different roles serves both policymakers as well as socio-hydrological modelers.

Research on the testing effect shows that practice involving retrieval from memory can facilitate later memory in contrast to passive restudy. Despite extensive behavioral work, the brain processes that make retrieval an effective learning strategy remain unclear. In the present experiment, we explored how initially retrieving items affected memory a day later as compared to a condition involving traditional restudy. In contrast to restudy, initial testing that contributed to future memory success was associated with engagement of several regions including the anterior hippocampus, lateral temporal cortices, and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC). Additionally, testing enhanced hippocampal connectivity with ventrolateral PFC and midline regions. These findings indicate that the testing effect may be contingent on processes that are typically thought to support memory success at encoding (e.g. relational binding, selection and elaboration of semantically-related information) in addition to those more often associated with retrieval (e.g. memory search).

A remote training architecture, the REmote Patient Education in a Telemedicine Environment (REPETE) architecture, using a remote control protocol (RCP) was developed. A set of design criteria was specified. The developed architecture was integrated into the IDEATel home telemedicine unit (HTU) and evaluated against these design criteria using a combination of technical and expert evaluations. Technical evaluation of the architecture demonstrated that remote cursor movements and positioning displayed on the HTU were smooth and effectively real-time. The trainers were able to observe within approximately 2 seconds lag what the patient sees on their HTU screen. Evaluation of the architecture by experts was favorable. Responses to a Likert scale questionnaire regarding audio quality and remote control performance indicated that the expert evaluators thought that the audio quality and remote control performance were adequate for remote training. All evaluators strongly agreed that the system would be useful for training patients. The REPETE architecture supports basic training needs over a narrowband dial-up connection. We were able to maintain an audio chat simultaneously with performing a remote training session, while maintaining both acceptable audio quality and remote control performance. The RCP provides a mechanism to provide training without requiring a trainer to go to the patient's home and effectively supports deictic referencing to on screen objects.

In the ongoing debate about the interpretation of this Act, comparative information about the opinions of the different stakeholders is needed. Aim: To evaluate the opinions of Dutch physicians, nurses and the general public on the legal requirements for euthanasia and PAS. Design: A cross-sectional survey among Dutch physicians and nurses in primary and secondary care and members of the Dutch general public, followed by qualitative interviews among selected respondents. The participants were: 793 physicians, 1243 nurses and 1960 members of the general public who completed the questionnaire; 83 were interviewed. Results: Most respondents agreed with the requirement of a patient request (64-88%) and the absence of a requirement concerning life expectancy (48-71%). PAS was thought acceptable by 24-39% of respondents for patients requesting it because of mental suffering due to loss of control, chronic depression or early dementia. In the case of severe dementia, one third of physicians, 58% of nurses and 77% of the general public agreed with performing euthanasia based on an advance directive. Interviewees illustrated these findings and supported the Act. Conclusions: Health care professionals and the general public mostly support the legal requirements for euthanasia and PAS. The law permits euthanasia or PAS for mental suffering but this possibility is not widely endorsed. The general public is more liberal towards euthanasia for advanced dementia than health care professionals. We conclude that there is ample support for the law after eight years of legal euthanasia.

In recent years, taking a walk becomes popular with not only the elderly, but also those from all ages as one of the easiest ways for health promotion. From the viewpoint of health promotion, it is desirable to take a walk as daily exercise. However, walking is very simple activity, which makes it difficult for people to maintain their motivation. Although using an activity monitor is expected to improve the motivation for taking a walk as daily exercise, it forces users to manage their activities by themselves. The proposed system solves such a problem by recommending a walking route that can consume target calories. When a system is to be used for long period of time for supporting user's daily exercise, it should consider the case when a user will not follow the recommended route. It would cause a gap between consumed and target calories. We think this problem becomes serious when a user gradually gets bored with taking a walk during a long period of time. In order to solve the problem, the proposed method implicitly manages calories on monthly basis and recommends walking routes that could keep a user from getting bored. The effectiveness of the recommendation algorithm is evaluated with agent simulation. As another important factor for walking support, this paper also proposes a navigation interface that presents direction to the next visiting point without using a map. As users do not have to continuously focus on the interface, it is not only useful for their safety, but also gives them room to enjoy the landscape. The interface is evaluated by an experiment with test participants.

Anowarul			Establishment of forage kochia in seeding mixtures with perennial grasses	GRASSLAND SCIENCE			English	Article						establishment; revegetation; seed mixture	COOL-SEASON GRASSES; CRESTED WHEATGRASS; GERMINATION; PLANTS	Forage kochia (Bassia prostrata L.) can persist in disturbed areas and provide high-quality forage even during fall and winter months. However, information is needed on the effect of planting time and subsequent environmental conditions on forage kochia establishment. A field study was initiated in 2014 in Wyoming to determine the optimum planting time for successful forage kochia establishment and examine its performance in seeded mixtures with perennial cool-season grasses in areas dominated by annual weeds. The experiment was carried out using split-plot in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The main plots consisted of three planting times (late winter, early spring and summer), and subplots included eight seeding mixture treatments. Species included in mixtures were forage kochia, four native grasses and two nonnative grasses. The summer (May) planting failed completely, and early spring (April) planting resulted in greater plant density for forage kochia and grasses than late winter (March) planting. Although, forage kochia monoculture had greater forage kochia density than other treatments, forage kochia stands were satisfactory when seeded in mixtures with perennial grasses. By the year after planting, plant density of forage kochia and grasses was reduced to about one-third of 2014 density. During initial establishment stage, it is thought that forage kochia and perennial grasses were affected by dense cover of annual weeds. However, greater plant density was observed for April compared to March plantings, and forage kochia monoculture had good stands despite dense stands of annual weeds, even in 2015. The results suggest that successful establishment of forage kochia is possible when it is planted in early spring under conditions of this study. However, monitoring stands the following years is needed to determine the persistence and forage production of different seeding mixtures of forage kochia and perennial grasses.

This study surveyed consumers in the Republic of Korea to obtain general insights into their perceptions, knowledge, and use of GM crop-based food, their needs for information about GM foods, their GM food-purchasing intentions, their usual food-purchasing habits, and whether there are groups with particular demographic profiles and stances on GM foods that would benefit most from well-designed public education programs. In total, 1096 adults in the Republic of Korea underwent face-to-face interviews in 2017. The cohort composition was based on recent population data. Only 5.8% had a positive stance on GM foods, while 58.8% perceived GM foods as being risky to human health. While 50.3% thought that they were somewhat to very knowledgeable about GM organisms (GMO), their actual knowledge was low (< 25% provided correct answers to three basic questions). Mass media was selected as the most common, powerful, and effective source of information. Experts such as professors and scientists were considered the most credible information sources. The "safety of GMO" was by far the most preferred topic for education. This reflects the huge anxiety of the consumers about GM-food safety. Indeed, a large proportion of consumers (54.7%) said they would avoid purchasing GM foods in the future. Future GM food-purchasing intentions related significantly with attitudes to, risk perception of, and knowledge about GM foods (all p < 0.001). Several target groups may benefit most from effective education programs: the elderly, consumers with a family member with an allergy, asthma, or atopy, people with a negative stance on GM foods and/or who perceive them to be risky, and people who strongly prefer environmentally friendly food. These findings on current consumer attitudes to GM foods will facilitate strategic approaches to educating the public about GMO and GM foods.

Here, we argue that by combining the perspective of SI with the four functions of PM (normative, substantive, instrumental, and educational), we can strengthen a collaborative and positive PM process, systematically designed to create socio-emotional decisions that stakeholders bring out into a wider system with them. This entails drawing from the four functions of PM, (normative, substantive, instrumental, and educational). To provide a blueprint of how each function might be achieved, we examine, through a trans -disciplinary lens, the characteristics of each function, the sub-components and practical suggestions of how that might be applied in a PM context. Our main focus is to encourage a systems-based approach to achieving these functions, thereby avoiding piecemeal solutions, so we explore how the perspective of Systems Intelligence provides a lens and organizing structure to consider, design and facilitate PM. SI can help us to conceptualize and design PM, as it understands the central role of people within a dynamic system, a key starting point for those looking to design or direct their own PM process or for those searching (researchers, practitioners, or policymakers) for long-term solutions to problems of socio-ecological systems (SES). We look at how these two fields, PM and SI, might combine in practice, and suggest several promising areas of study to explore further. These insights will be of use to PM facilitators and researchers, as well as others using participatory methods in addressing SES challenges, particularly those encouraging the adoption of systemic perspectives, like Systems Intelligence.

At the same time, educational institutions at all levels have recognized its relevance and introduced courses that aim at familiarizing their students with the basic concepts of nanotechnology. While the importance of teaching nanotechnology, the contents of such courses, and insightful activities in the laboratory have received a lot of attention, the classroom activities that help students grasp the concepts of nanotechnology have been rather underrepresented, especially in higher education. Here, we describe a student activity that focuses on a research proposal as part of a third-year undergraduate nanotechnology course for chemistry majors. Students work in pairs to review a relevant and contemporary topic in nanotechnology and to propose and develop an original research idea. This is presented and defended in the form of an oral presentation before an audience of peers and is written using an article template. The aim of the described approach is to not only help students learn about nanotechnology in a fun and active manner but also to stimulate critical scientific thinking in students as well as to foster the development of their academic, professional, and soft skills. In line with this, the assessment of students relies on the assessment of the oral presentation, engagement in discussion, and the written research proposal.

Nevertheless, China started SRT nationwide only in the recent decade. During these years, researchers have been searching for suitable teaching methods to improve the abilities of residents. Although the problem-based learning (PBL) teaching mode has been applied in undergraduate teaching for many years, the teaching effect of PBL has not been unified in Chinese SRT according to the core competences of the residents. Methods Studies that compared the teaching effect of PBL and lecture-based learning (LBL) on SRT in China from January 2010 to April 2020 in the Chinese databases, such as China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang, WeiPu, Chinese BioMedical Literature (CBM), and English-language online databases, such as PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were systematically reviewed. Data were analyzed using the Stata version 12.0 software. Results A total of 75 articles (76 studies) were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with LBL group, PBL-based methods are more effective in the mastery of medical theory knowledge (WMD = 7.14, 95% CI: 5.93-8.34), operational skills (WMD = 6.54, 95% CI: 4.55-8.53), analysis and diagnosis of cases (WMD = 8.52, 95% CI: 7.50-9.53), and overall capacity (WMD = 8.70, 95% CI: 6.87-10.53), but showed no advantage on operational skills in diagnostic imaging (WMD = 1.30, 95% CI: -0.11-2.71). The questionnaire surveys analyzed in this meta-analysis indicated the positive effects of PBL on the mastery of theoretical knowledge, clinical diagnostic thinking, teamwork ability, ability to analyze and solve problems, ability to consult documents, learning interest and learning efficiency, but that there were no advantages in improving self-directed learning ability, communication ability and hands-on ability. The questionnaire result analyzed in this meta-analysis also showed the residents' satisfaction with PBL-based strategies. Conclusions Taken together, the current meta-analysis provides a systematic and comprehensive analysis on PBL teaching mode in Chinese SRT and outlines a path for further research on the detailed design of suitable teaching methods for different specialties and abilities.

In this study, an experimental design with a pre-test/post-test control group was used. The research was conducted with 58 students in a secondary school of Ankara. At the beginning of the study, the students in the experimental and control groups used the "Academic success test" developed by the researcher and "Online Technologies Self-Efficacy Scale" developed by Miltiadou and Yu (2000) as pre-tests. At the end of the four-week experimental period, both groups used the same scales as post-tests. The results of this research have indicated that there is a meaningful difference in terms of academic success in favour of the experimental group. However, it has been shown that there is no meaningful difference in students' online technologies self-efficacy. This research results are expected to provide useful information about the digital classroom's being used at schools. In addition, when the importance digital classroom gave to interaction between parents and the school was thought, including parents into the research process may help to see the shortcomings clearly and develop the digital classroom.

J	Nourani, A; Ayatollahi, H; Solaymani-Dodaran, M				Nourani, Aynaz; Ayatollahi, Haleh; Solaymani-Dodaran, Masoud			A Clinical Data Management System for Diabetes Clinical Trials	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING			English	Article							ELECTRONIC DATA CAPTURE; IMPLEMENTATION	Background. The use of novel medications and methods to prevent, diagnose, treat, and manage diabetes requires confirmation of safety and efficacy in a well-designed study prior to widespread adoption. Diabetes clinical trials are the studies that examine these issues. The aim of the present study was to develop a web-based system for data management in diabetes clinical trials. Methods. The present research was a mixed-methods study conducted in 2019. To identify the required data elements and functions to develop the system, 60 researchers completed a questionnaire. The designed system was evaluated using two methods. The usability of the system was initially evaluated by a group of researchers (n = 6) using the think-aloud method, and after system improvement, the system functions were evaluated by other researchers (n = 30) using a questionnaire. Results. The main data elements which were required to develop a case report form included "study data," "participant's personal data," and "clinical data." The functional requirements of the system were "managing the study," "creating case report forms," "data management," "data quality control," and "data security and confidentiality." After using the system, researchers rated the system functions at a "good" level (6.3 +/- 0.73) on a seven-point Likert scale. Conclusion. Given the complexity of the data management processes in diabetes clinical trials and the widespread use of information technologies in research, the use of clinical data management systems in diabetes clinical trials seems inevitable. The system developed in the current study can facilitate and improve the process of creating and managing case report forms as well as collecting data in diabetes clinical trials.

Ideology and Vote Choice in US Mayoral Elections: Evidence from Facebook Surveys	POLITICAL BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Local politics; Ideology; Voting behavior; United States	LOS-ANGELES; CANDIDATES; PARTISANSHIP; POLITICS; STATE; RACE; CITY	City elections in the U.S. are widely thought to be low-information contests decided by non-ideological factors. This consensus casts doubt on the possibility of electoral accountability in cities, and renders recent evidence of municipal responsiveness puzzling. However, our knowledge of how voters actually behave in local elections is severely limited by a lack of individual-level survey data collected from local contests. Using three such original surveys, I re-examine the role of ideology in mayoral elections, recruiting samples of local voters via geotargeted Facebook advertisements. In two large cities, I find ideology is a powerful and independent predictor of vote choice. Using a panel design, I find voters learn the relative ideological positions of candidates over the course of a campaign, and that learning causally impacts vote choice. The effect of ideology also replicates in a conjoint experiment fielded to a sample of small-city voters in another region. Electoral accountability is thus a plausible explanation for ideological responsiveness in U.S. cities, and the methodological tools introduced here can now be applied to a variety of questions about local voter behavior.

This helps ensure that interventions are relevant, persuasive, and feasible while remaining evidence-based. This paper provides a set of iterative methods to rapidly adapt and optimize an intervention during implementation. These methods are demonstrated through the example of optimizing an effective online handwashing intervention called Germ Defense. Methods: Three revised versions of the intervention were rapidly optimized and launched within short timeframes of 1-2 months. Optimisations were informed by: regular stakeholder engagement; emerging scientific evidence, and changing government guidance; rapid qualitative research (telephone think-aloud interviews and open-text surveys), and analyses of usage data. All feedback was rapidly collated, using the Table of Changes method from the Person-Based Approach to prioritize potential optimisations in terms of their likely impact on behavior change. Written feedback from stakeholders on each new iteration of the intervention also informed specific optimisations of the content. Results: Working closely with clinical stakeholders ensured that the intervention was clinically accurate, for example, confirming that information about transmission and exposure was consistent with evidence. Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) contributors identified important clarifications to intervention content, such as whether Covid-19 can be transmitted via air as well as surfaces, and ensured that information about difficult behaviors (such as self-isolation) was supportive and feasible. Iterative updates were made in line with emerging evidence, including changes to the information about face-coverings and opening windows. Qualitative research provided insights into barriers to engaging with the intervention and target behaviors, with open-text surveys providing a useful supplement to detailed think-aloud interviews. Usage data helped identify common points of disengagement, which guided decisions about optimisations. The Table of Changes was modified to facilitate rapid collation and prioritization of multiple sources of feedback to inform optimisations. Engagement with PPI informed the optimisation process. Conclusions: Rapid optimisation methods of this kind may in future be used to help improve the speed and efficiency of adaptation, optimization, and implementation of interventions, in line with calls for more rapid, pragmatic health research methods.

Recently, nanopesticides have been developed to replace classic pesticides. Their wide application in the agricultural practice leads to deposition of nanomaterials (and potential residuals) in the natural environment. The use of nanopesticides is a great challenge for biodiversity; however, not as originally envisioned. We discuss how nanopesticides may pose risks for biodiversity at far lower concentrations/doses than currently thought. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

'That's just how I am': a qualitative interview study to identify factors influencing engagement with a digital intervention for tinnitus self-management	BRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						tinnitus; digital intervention; qualitative interviews; engagement; context; self&#8208; management		Objectives To explore users' reactions to and expectations of the Tinnitus E-Programme 2.0, a digital cognitive behavioural intervention for tinnitus, and to identify contextual factors and mechanisms of action that may influence user engagement with the intervention. Design Qualitative interview study. Methods Think-aloud and semi-structured interviews were carried out with 19 people with tinnitus. Interviews explored participants' views of the intervention's information and advice, its wider intervention goals (e.g. behaviour change, self-management), and factors that may strengthen or impede users' engagement. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis, and findings were used to develop a conceptual model of user engagement with the intervention. Results Generally, participants expressed positive views of the intervention, its intervention components, and its design features. Identified contextual factors included pre-existing attitudes, beliefs, skills, and knowledge (e.g. perceptions of tinnitus symptom severity, openness to tinnitus management, and psychological techniques); previous experience of tinnitus management; and characteristics of the condition (e.g. heterogeneous nature of tinnitus, stage in healthcare journey). These contextual factors were hypothesized to influence engagement through four mechanisms of action: motivation to change tinnitus-related attitudes and behaviour; perceived personal relevance of the intervention; expectations of benefit; and appeal of the intervention techniques. Conclusions This study demonstrated the acceptability of the Tinnitus E-Programme 2.0 amongst its target group, while highlighting potential areas for improvement in future intervention modifications. Our findings identified contextual factors that others developing interventions for tinnitus or cognitive behavioural interventions may wish to consider.

New Opportunities in Dual Process Theory and Process Tracing Methods	SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Article							DECISION-MAKING; WORKING-MEMORY; PERCEIVED EXERTION; PROSPECT-THEORY; PERFORMANCE; PERCEPTION; FATIGUE; RESPONSES; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY	The extent to which athletic pacing decisions are made consciously or subconsciously is a prevailing issue. In this article we discuss why the one-dimensional conscioussubconscious debate that has reigned in the pacing literature has suppressed our understanding of the multidimensional processes that occur in pacing decisions. How do we make our decisions in real-life competitive situations? What information do we use and how do we respond to opponents? These are questions that need to be explored and better understood, using smartly designed experiments. The paper provides clarity about key conscious, preconscious, subconscious and unconscious concepts, terms that have previously been used in conflicting and confusing ways. The potential of dual process theory in articulating multidimensional aspects of intuitive and deliberative decision-making processes is discussed in the context of athletic pacing along with associated process-tracing research methods. In attempting to refine pacing models and improve training strategies and psychological skills for athletes, the dualprocess framework could be used to gain a clearer understanding of (1) the situational conditions for which either intuitive or deliberative decisions are optimal; (2) how intuitive and deliberative decisions are biased by things such as perception, emotion and experience; and (3) the underlying cognitive mechanisms such as memory, attention allocation, problem solving and hypothetical thought.

In such scenarios, it is necessary to make classifiers such that they are: (a) harder to evade, (b) easier to detect changes in the data distribution over time, and (c) be able to retrain and recover from model degradation. While most works in the security of machine learning have concentrated on the evasion resistance problem (a), there is little work in the areas of reacting to attacks (b) and (c). Additionally, while streaming data research concentrates on the ability to react to changes to the data distribution, they often take an adversarial agnostic view of the security problem. This makes them vulnerable to adversarial activity, which is aimed toward evading the concept drift detection mechanism itself. In this paper, we analyze the security of machine learning from a dynamic and adversarial aware perspective. The existing techniques of restrictive one-class classifier models, complex learning-based ensemble models, and randomization-based ensemble models are shown to be myopic as they approach security as a static task. These methodologies are ill suited for a dynamic environment, as they leak excessive information to an adversary who can subsequently launch attacks which are indistinguishable from the benign data. Based on empirical vulnerability analysis against a sophisticated adversary, a novel feature importance hiding approach for classifier design is proposed. The proposed design ensures that future attacks on classifiers can be detected and recovered from. The proposed work provides motivation, by serving as a blueprint, for future work in the area of dynamic-adversarial mining, which combines lessons learned from streaming data mining, adversarial learning, and cybersecurity.

Multiple camera systems such as polydioptric sensors provide more efficient and precise solutions for autonomous navigation. They are particularly suitable for motion estimation because they allow one to formulate a linear optimization. These sensors capture the visual information in a more complete form called the plenoptic function that encodes the spatial and temporal light radiance of the scene. The polydioptric sensors are rarely used in robotics because they are usually thought to increase the amount of data produced and require more computational power. This paper shows that these cameras provide more accurate estimation results in mobile robotics navigation if designed properly. It also shows that a plenoptic vision sensor with a resolution ranging from 3 x 3 to 40 x 30 pixels camera, provides higher accuracy than a mono-SLAM running on a 320 x 240 pixels camera. The paper also gives a complete scheme to design usable real-time plenoptic cameras for mobile robotics applications by establishing the link between velocity, resolution and motion estimation accuracy. Finally, experiments on a mobile robot are shown allowing for a comparison between optimal plenoptic visual sensors and single high-resolution cameras. The estimation with the plenoptic sensor is more accurate than a monocular high-definition camera with a processing time 100 times lower.

The Registry is a clinical physician-driven non-population- and electronic-based instrument implemented for the retrospective and prospective collection of real-life data about demographics, clinical, therapeutic, laboratory, instrumental and socioeconomic information from BD patients; the Registry is based on the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tool, which is thought to collect standardised information for clinical real-life research, and has been realised to change over time according to future scientific acquisitions and potentially communicate with other existing and future Registries dedicated to BD. Starting from January 31st, 2021, to February 7th, 2022, 110 centres from 23 countries in 4 continents have been involved. Fifty-four of these have already obtained the approval from their local Ethics Committees. Currently, the platform counts 290 users (111 Principal Investigators, 175 Site Investigators, 2 Lead Investigators, and 2 data managers). The Registry collects baseline and follow-up data using 5993 fields organised into 16 instruments, including patient's demographics, history, clinical manifestations and symptoms, trigger/risk factors, therapies and healthcare access. The development of the AIDA International Registry for BD patients will facilitate the collection of standardised data leading to real-world evidence, enabling international multicentre collaborative research through data sharing, international consultation, dissemination of knowledge, inclusion of patients and families, and ultimately optimisation of scientific efforts and implementation of standardised care.

Here we measured the precision of the explicit metacognitive information that young adults have about their own facial expressions. Participants imitated pictures of themselves making facial expressions and triggered a camera to take a picture of them while doing so. They then rated how well they thought they imitated each expression. We defined metacognitive access to facial expressions as the relationship between objective performance (how well the two pictures matched) and subjective performance ratings. As a group, participants' metacognitive confidence ratings were only about four times less precise than their own similarity ratings. In turn, machine learning analyses revealed that participants' performance ratings were based on idiosyncratic subsets of features. We conclude that metacognitive access to one's own facial expressions is only partial.

Identifying management practices for promoting infection prevention: Perspectives on strategic communication	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL			English	Article						Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs); Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs); Leadership; Hospitals	HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS; PERFORMANCE; HOSPITALS	Background: Engaging leaders to share information about infections and infection prevention across their organizations is known to be important in initiatives designed to reduce healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Yet the topics and communication strategies used by leaders that focus on HAI prevention are not well understood. This study aimed to identify and describe practices around information sharing used to support HAI prevention. Methods: We visited 18 U.S. hospitals between 2017 and 2019 and interviewed 188 administrative and clinical leaders to ask about management practices they used to facilitate HAI prevention. Interview transcripts were analyzed to characterize practices involving strategic communications. Results: Sharing information to support infection prevention involved strategic communications around two main topics: (1) facilitators of success and best practices, and (2) barriers to success and lessons learned. In addition, the practice of storytelling reportedly allowed leaders to highlight impact and elicit emotion, provide education, and acknowledge success in infection prevention by providing examples of real events. Conclusions: Our findings provide insight about how strategic communication of information around HAIs and HAI prevention can be used to support improvement. Organizations and leaders should consider the different opportunities to incorporate the practice of strategic communication, including using storytelling, to advance their infection prevention efforts.

J	Khan, F; Amatya, B				Khan, F.; Amatya, B.			Rehabilitation interventions in patients with acute demyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy: a systematic review	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL AND REHABILITATION MEDICINE			English	Review						Guillain-Barre syndrome; Rehabilitation; Disabled persons	GUILLAIN-BARRE-SYNDROME; ELECTRICAL NERVE-STIMULATION; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; LOW-BACK-PAIN; EPIDEMIOLOGIC FEATURES; EXERCISE; OUTCOMES; MANAGEMENT; FATIGUE; FITNESS	Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barre syndrome, GBS) can be a significant cause of new long-term disability, which is thought to be amenable to rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is an expensive resource and the evidence to support its justification is urgently needed. This systematic review presents an evidence-based overview of the effectiveness of various rehabilitation interventions in adults with GBS and the outcomes that are affected. Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, LILACS and the Cochrane Library were searched up to March 2012 for studies reporting outcomes of GBS patients following rehabilitation interventions that addressed functional restoration and participation. Two reviewers applied the inclusion criteria to select potential studies and independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality. Included studies were critically appraised using GRADE methodological quality approach. Formal levels of evidence of each intervention were assigned using a standard format defined by National Health and Medical Research Council. Fourteen papers (one systematic review, one randomized controlled trial, one case-control study, five cohort studies and six case series/reports) that described a range of rehabilitation interventions for persons with GBS were evaluated for the "best" evidence to date. One high quality randomised controlled trial demonstrated effectiveness of higher intensity multidisciplinary ambulatory rehabilitation in reducing disability in persons with GBS in the later stages of recovery, compared with lesser intensity rehabilitation intervention for up to 12 months. Four observational studies, further demonstrated some support for improved disability and quality of life following inpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation up to 12 months. Evidence for uni-disciplinary rehabilitation interventions is limited, with 'satisfactory' evidence for physical therapy in reducing fatigue, improving function and quality of life in persons with GBS. This review provides "good" evidence to support multidisciplinary rehabilitative intervention in adults with GBS; and "satisfactory" evidence for physical therapy in these patients. Evidence for other uni-disciplinary interventions is limited or inconclusive. The gaps in existing research should not be interpreted as ineffectiveness of rehabilitation intervention in GBS. Further research is needed with appropriate study designs, outcome measurement, type of modalities and cost-effectiveness of these interventions.

J	Chen, ZH; Zhang, CC; Fan, GH				Chen, Zhihong; Zhang, Chaochuang; Fan, Guanhua			Interrelationship between Interpersonal Interaction Intensity and Health Self-Efficacy in People with Diabetes or Prediabetes on Online Diabetes Social Platforms: An In-Depth Survey in China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						online health community; diabetes mellitus; self-efficacy; peer assistance; group participation; health communication	GLYCEMIC CONTROL; MANAGEMENT BEHAVIORS; CARE BEHAVIORS; PEER SUPPORT; COMMUNITIES; INFORMATION; INTERVENTION; EDUCATION	Objective:The peer interaction-based online model has been influential in the recent development of diabetes management. This model "extends and innovates" the traditional mode of doctor-patient guidance, transforming it into a mode in which both doctor-patient guidance and patient-patient interaction coexist; this new mode has the added advantage of offering "extended continual intervention." This study contributes to research on extending diabetes management models by investigating how patients with diabetes or prediabetes interact in online health communities, focusing on the interrelationship between self-efficacy characteristics and online participation during patient-patient interactions.Methods:In this cross-sectional study, participants with diabetes of various severities completed an electronic questionnaire, which was formulated with a revised classical scale. The questionnaire was disseminated through diabetes online health communities. Its content covered the respondent's general condition, self-evaluation of their self-efficacy, and participation in online health communities, specifically with respect to factors such as the time spent in online information each day, the number of groups joined, and the extent of interaction in diabetes online health communities, etc. The main observation indicators were the participants' self-efficacy, their extent of online participation, and the characteristics of online health communities. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, linear trend estimation, and ordinal logistic regression were used to explore the relationship between the three indicators.Results:The self-efficacy scores (x over bar +/- s) were 51.9 +/- 9.12, and 59.1% of interviewed participants had self-efficacy scores greater than the mean. Overall, most participants (96%) considered online diabetes social platforms to be helpful. Groups differed with respect to interaction mode, which indicated that people with high self-efficacy tend to employ various modes of interaction. Participants with high self-efficacy were also more likely to live in cities (p< 0.05) and be married (p< 0.05) and tended to spend more time paying attention to group information (p< 0.05), spend more time viewing group information (p< 0.05), and have a greater degree of interaction with group members (p< 0.05). Information sources for the different grades of participants was primarily obtained from social media.Conclusion:Among people with diabetes, the frequency and intensity of online interaction might positively affect self-efficacy and, by implication, diabetes self-management. Diabetics with high self-efficacy also tend to have positive online interaction and adopt different ways of interaction. In addition, the diabetes information sources of the respondents mainly come from social networks, most of the respondents think that online social networking sites have a positive impact on diabetes self-management, which shows that social network plays an important role in diabetes information source of diabetics. However, the design of online health communities has room for improvement, specifically with respect to the provision of information that patients require. As an interesting side note, among people with diabetes or prediabetes, those who lived in urban area and were married, those who paid more attention to group information, and those who actively participated in interactions tended to have relatively high self-efficacy. The results suggest that people with diabetes have higher-quality self-care when they engage in online health community interactions; such benefits cannot be obtained from treatment in a hospital. In general, enhanced self-efficacy in people with diabetes enables them to more readily acquire diabetes-related knowledge. Online interaction with diabetics, who has the same experience, can not only get more information, but also have a sense of identity and belonging, which enhances self-efficacy and further urges them to actively participate in online interaction. Therefore, online health communities are an important supplement to the clinical treatment of diabetes mellitus and clinicians can take advantage of the educational function of online diabetes groups in their provision of tailored diabetes interventions and take into account the factors that affect the self-efficacy of diabetics (including the frequency and intensity of online interaction, age, marital status, residential area, etc.), to provide tailored diabetes interventions for diabetics. Such a use of online diabetes groups can strengthen diabetes self-management.

J	Peng, YB; Ren, JS; Wang, JM; Shi, ML				Peng, Yinbin; Ren, Jiansi; Wang, Jiamei; Shi, Meilin			Spectral-Swin Transformer with Spatial Feature Extraction Enhancement for Hyperspectral Image Classification	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						transformer; shifted window; spatial feature extraction (SFE); spatial position encoding (SPE); hyperspectral image (HSI) classification	OBJECT DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; RANDOM FOREST; SVM	Hyperspectral image classification (HSI) has rich applications in several fields. In the past few years, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models have demonstrated great performance in HSI classification. However, CNNs are inadequate in capturing long-range dependencies, while it is possible to think of the spectral dimension of HSI as long sequence information. More and more researchers are focusing their attention on transformer which is good at processing sequential data. In this paper, a spectral shifted window self-attention based transformer (SSWT) backbone network is proposed. It is able to improve the extraction of local features compared to the classical transformer. In addition, spatial feature extraction module (SFE) and spatial position encoding (SPE) are designed to enhance the spatial feature extraction of the transformer. The spatial feature extraction module is proposed to address the deficiency of transformer in the capture of spatial features. The loss of spatial structure of HSI data after inputting transformer is supplemented by proposed spatial position encoding. On three public datasets, we ran extensive experiments and contrasted the proposed model with a number of powerful deep learning models. The outcomes demonstrate that our suggested approach is efficient and that the proposed model performs better than other advanced models.

As a result, countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea share common public health threats. Among them are vector-borne diseases, and in particular, mosquito-borne viral diseases are prime candidates as (re)emerging diseases and are likely to spread across the area. Improving preparedness and response capacities to these threats at the regional level is therefore a major issue. The implementation of entomological surveillance is, in particular, of utmost importance. Guidance in designing entomological surveillance systems is critical, and these systems may pursue different specific objectives depending on the disease. The purpose of the proposed review is to draw up guidelines for designing effective and sustainable entomological surveillance systems in order to improve preparedness and response. However, we make it clear that there is no universal surveillance system, so the thinking behind harmonisation is to define evidence-based standards in order to promote best practises, identify the most appropriate surveillance activities, and optimise the use of resources. Such guidance is aimed at policymakers and diverse stakeholders and is intended to be used as a framework for the implementation of entomological surveillance programmes. It will also be useful to collaborate and share information with health professionals involved in other areas of disease surveillance. Medical entomologists and vector control professionals will be able to refer to this report to advocate for tailored entomological surveillance strategies. The main threats targeted in this review are the vectors of dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and Rift Valley fever virus. The vectors of all these arboviruses are mosquitoes. Methods Current knowledge on vector surveillance in the Mediterranean area is reviewed. The analysis was carried out by a collaboration of the medical entomology experts in the region, all of whom belong to the MediLabSecure network, which is currently funded by the European Union and represents an international effort encompassing 19 countries in the Mediterranean and Black Sea region. Findings Robust surveillance systems are required to address the globalisation of emerging arboviruses. The prevention and management of mosquito-borne viral diseases must be addressed in the prism of a One Health strategy that includes entomological surveillance as an integral part of the policy. Entomological surveillance systems should be designed according to the entomological and epidemiological context and must have well-defined objectives in order to effect a tailored and graduated response. We therefore rely on different scenarios according to different entomological and epidemiological contexts and set out detailed objectives of surveillance. The development of multidisciplinary networks involving both academics and public authorities will provide resources to address these health challenges by promoting good practises in surveillance (identification of surveillance aims, design of surveillance systems, data collection, dissemination of surveillance results, evaluation of surveillance activities) and through the sharing of effective knowledge and information. These networks will also contribute to capacity building and stronger collaborations between sectors at both the local and regional levels. Finally, concrete guidance is offered on the vector of the main arbovirus based on the current situation in the area.

J	Fujioka, T; Trainor, LJ; Ross, B; Kakigi, R; Pantev, C				Fujioka, T; Trainor, LJ; Ross, B; Kakigi, R; Pantev, C			Musical training enhances automatic encoding of melodic contour and interval structure	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							AUDITORY-CORTEX; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; PHONEME REPRESENTATIONS; POTENTIAL ERP; BRAIN; MEMORY; RECOGNITION; MUSICIANS; LANGUAGE; SOUND	In music, melodic information is thought to be encoded in two forms, a contour code (up/down pattern of pitch changes) and an interval code (pitch distances between successive notes). A recent study recording the mismatch negativity (MMN) evoked by pitch contour and interval deviations in simple melodies demonstrated that people with no formal music education process both contour and interval information in the auditory cortex automatically. However, it is still unclear whether musical experience enhances both strategies of melodic encoding. We designed stimuli to examine contour and interval information separately. In the contour condition there were eight different standard melodies (presented oil 80% Of trials), each consisting of five notes all ascending in pitch, and the corresponding deviant melodies (20%) were altered to descending on their final note. The interval condition used one five-note standard melody transposed to eight keys from trial to trial, and on deviant trials the last note was raised by one whole tone without changing the pitch contour. There was also a control condition, in which a standard tone (990.7 Hz) and a deviant tone (1111.0 Hz) were presented. The magnetic counterpart of the MMN (MMNm) from musicians and nonmusicians was obtained as the difference between the dipole moment in response to the standard and deviant trials recorded by magnetoencephalography. Significantly larger MMNm was present in musicians in both contour and interval conditions than in nonmusicians, whereas MMNm in the control condition was similar for both groups. The interval MMNm was larger than the contour MMNm in musicians. No hemispheric difference was found in either group. The results suggest that musical training enhances the ability to automatically register abstract changes in the relative pitch structure of melodies.

J	Qi, RL; Li, MH; Ma, YY; Chen, NH				Qi, Renli; Li, Minghong; Ma, Yuanye; Chen, Nanhui			State-Dependent Changes in Auditory Sensory Gating in Different Cortical Areas in Rats	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; P50 COMPONENT; HUMAN SLEEP; BRAIN-STEM; NREM SLEEP; K-COMPLEX; NON-REM; EEG	Sensory gating is a process in which the brain's response to a repetitive stimulus is attenuated; it is thought to contribute to information processing by enabling organisms to filter extraneous sensory inputs from the environment. To date, sensory gating has typically been used to determine whether brain function is impaired, such as in individuals with schizophrenia or addiction. In healthy subjects, sensory gating is sensitive to a subject's behavioral state, such as acute stress and attention. The cortical response to sensory stimulation significantly decreases during sleep; however, information processing continues throughout sleep, and an auditory evoked potential (AEP) can be elicited by sound. It is not known whether sensory gating changes during sleep. Sleep is a non-uniform process in the whole brain with regional differences in neural activities. Thus, another question arises concerning whether sensory gating changes are uniform in different brain areas from waking to sleep. To address these questions, we used the sound stimuli of a Conditioning-testing paradigm to examine sensory gating during waking, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and Non-REM (NREM) sleep in different cortical areas in rats. We demonstrated the following: 1. Auditory sensory gating was affected by vigilant states in the frontal and parietal areas but not in the occipital areas. 2. Auditory sensory gating decreased in NREM sleep but not REM sleep from waking in the frontal and parietal areas. 3. The decreased sensory gating in the frontal and parietal areas during NREM sleep was the result of a significant increase in the test sound amplitude.

Several other drugs are known to kill the schistosomes in vivo and in vitro, but these are seldom employed because of toxicity, high cost, complex administration or other reasons. The improvement of known drugs or the development of entirely new ones is a desirable goal, in view of the fact that strains of Schistosoma mansoni with reduced sensitivity to Praziquantel have appeared. In this review, we tried to collect the information available on known or putative macromolecular targets of schistosomicidal drugs; thus we focused on the biochemistry of the parasite, rather than the clinical properties of the drugs. The rationale of this approach is that drug design may become realistic if the mechanism of action of each known drug were known at atomic detail, ideally as the 3D structure of each drug in complex with its target. Important macromolecular targets of known drugs reviewed below are: Thioredoxin Glutathione Reductase; Cyclophilin; Acetyl Cholinesterase; Proteases and Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase. Moreover, a few enzymes of the parasite are known, or thought, to be "druggable", and therefore interesting, even though no specific drugs are available as yet: examples of such enzymes are Glutathione Peroxidase and Peroxiredoxins.

In solution and without inhibitors, the functionally important C-terminal segment of the NS2B cofactor is dissociated from DEN NS3pro ("open state"), necessitating a large structural change to produce the "closed state" thought to underpin activity. We analyzed the fold of DEN NS2B-NS3pro in solution with and without bound inhibitor by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Multiple paramagnetic lanthanide tags were attached to different sites to generate pseudocontact shifts (PCS). In the face of severe spectral overlap and broadening of many signals by conformational exchange, methods for assignment of N-15-HSQC cross-peaks included selective mutation, combinatorial isotope labeling, and comparison of experimental PCSs and PCSs back-calculated for a structural model of the closed conformation built by using the structure of the related West Nile virus (WNV) protease as a template. The PCSs show that, in the presence of a positively charged low-molecular weight inhibitor, the enzyme assumes a closed state that is very similar to the closed state previously observed for the WNV protease. Therefore, a model of the protease built on the closed conformation of the WNV protease is a better template for rational drug design than available crystal structures, at least for positively charged inhibitors. To assess the open state, we created a binding site for a Gd3+ complex and measured paramagnetic relaxation enhancements. The results show that the specific open conformation displayed in the crystal of DEN NS2B-NS3pro is barely populated in solution. The techniques used open an avenue to the fold analysis of proteins that yield poor NMR spectra, as PCSs from multiple sites in combination with model building generate powerful information even from incompletely assigned N-15-HSQC spectra.

MIDWIFERY			English	Article						MyBirthplace; Decision aid; Choice; Birth place; Decisional conflict	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CESAREAN-SECTION; CARE; AID; INFORMATION; MIDWIFERY; DELIVERY; SYSTEM; RISK	Objective: To assess the effectiveness of using an innovative decision aid, MyBirthplace, to facilitate shared decision-making regarding place of birth.Design: A quasi-experimental study comparing pre-test and post-test responses from participants who had access to the intervention.Setting: A large urban hospital in the south of England.Participants: All pregnant women who accessed maternity care between April and December 2016.Intervention: A decision aid (MyBirthplace) designed to provide information and support regarding place of birth. The digital tool (available in both an app and web-based version) was used to facilitate discuss between the women and her midwife at the booking visit.Measurements: Women's stage of decision making as measured by the Stage of Decision Making Scale. A questionnaire was administered before and after using MyBirthplace at booking, and again at 28 weeks gestation.Findings: Nearly half the women (42.1%) had already decided where they wanted to give birth before the booking appointment, but a third (34.3%) had not yet begun to think about their choices. The introduction of the decision aid during the booking visit was associated with a significant increase in the stage of decision making suggesting that women had greater certainty in their decision P < 0.0 0 01 [SD 1.077]. Women who accessed MyBirthplace had lower decisional conflict after the booking appointment than those women that did not access the decision aid (35.5% compared with 22.0%) but this difference was not statistically significant.Key Conclusions: Decision aids, as a standard part of practice, have the potential to ensure women are informed of their options and encourage shared decision making about place of birth. Women were more confident with their decision following the booking appointment and by 28 weeks; however, further research is needed to identify the role that the decision aid played in building this confidence.Implications for practice: The introduction of a decision aid, Mybirthplace, within the hospital impacted early discussions between the woman and the midwife and appeared to benefit women's decision making regarding place of birth. Further studies of midwives' use of innovative technologies and their implemen-tation are required.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Carnivore biodiversity in Tanzania: revealing the distribution patterns of secretive mammals using camera traps	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						camera traps; East Africa; ENFA; habitat use; carnivore biodiversity; monitoring	HABITAT SUITABILITY MODELS; CONSERVATION STATUS; INDICATORS; CHALLENGES; DENSITIES; SCIENCE; ABSENCE; GIS	Biodiversity monitoring is critical to assess the effectiveness of management activities and policy change, particularly in the light of accelerating impacts of environmental change, and for compiling national responses to international obligations and agreements. Monitoring methods able to identify species most likely to be affected by environmental change, and pinpoint those changes with the strongest impacts, will enable managers to target efforts towards vulnerable species and significant threats. Here we take a new approach to carnivore monitoring, combining camera-trap surveys with ecological niche factor analysis to assess distribution and patterns of habitat use of mammalian carnivore assemblages across northern Tanzania. We conducted 11 surveys over 430 camera-trap stations and 11 355 trap-days. We recorded 23 out of 35 carnivore species known to occur in Tanzania and report major extensions to the known distribution of the bushy-tailed mongoose Bdeogale crassicauda, previously thought to be rare. Carnivore biodiversity tended to be higher in national parks than in game reserves and forest reserves. We explored habitat use for seven species for which we had sufficient information. All species tended to be found near rivers and southern Acacia commiphora woodlands (except one mongoose species), and avoided deciduous shrubland, favouring deciduous woodland and/or open grassland. All species tended to avoid croplands suggesting that habitat conversion to agriculture could have serious implications for carnivore distribution. Our study provides a first example where camera-trap data are combined with niche analyses to reveal patterns in habitat use and spatial distribution of otherwise elusive and poorly known species and to inform reserve design and land-use planning. Our methodology represents a potentially powerful tool that can inform national and site-based wildlife managers and policy makers as well as international agreements on conservation.

Success depends on applying a team approach to quickly implement well-rehearsed, systematic, evidence-based assessment and treatment protocols. Mobile devices offer resources for readily accessible, easily updatable information that can be invaluable during perioperative critical events. We developed a mobile device version of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia 26 Pediatric Crisis paper checklists-the Pedi Crisis 2.0 application-as a resource to support clinician responses to pediatric perioperative life-threatening critical events. Human factors expertise and principles were applied to maximize usability, such as by clustering information into themes that clinicians utilize when accessing cognitive aids during critical events. The electronic environment allowed us to feature optional diagnostic support, optimized navigation, weight-based dosing, critical institution-specific phone numbers pertinent to emergency response, and accessibility for those who want larger font sizes. The design and functionality of the application were optimized for clinician use in real time during actual critical events, and it can also be used for self-study or review. Beta usability testing of the application was conducted with a convenience sample of clinicians at 9 institutions in 2 countries and showed that participants were able to find information quickly and as expected. In addition, clinicians rated the application as slightly above "excellent" overall on an established measure, the Systems Usability Scale, which is a 10-item, widely used and validated Likert scale created to assess usability for a variety of situations. The application can be downloaded, at no cost, for iOS devices from the Apple App Store and for Android devices from the Google Play Store. The processes and principles used in its development are readily applicable to the development of future mobile and electronic applications for the field of anesthesiology.

Vertebral Bomb Radiocarbon Suggests Extreme Longevity in White Sharks	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CARCHARODON-CARCHARIAS; AGE-DETERMINATION; PELAGIC SHARKS; ORANGE ROUGHY; LAMNA-NASUS; VALIDATION; GROWTH; POPULATIONS; CHRONOLOGIES; CONSERVATION	Conservation and management efforts for white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) remain hampered by a lack of basic demographic information including age and growth rates. Sharks are typically aged by counting growth bands sequentially deposited in their vertebrae, but the assumption of annual deposition of these band pairs requires testing. We compared radiocarbon (Delta C-14) values in vertebrae from four female and four male white sharks from the northwestern Atlantic Ocean (NWA) with reference chronologies documenting the marine uptake of C-14 produced by atmospheric testing of thermonuclear devices to generate the first radiocarbon age estimates for adult white sharks. Age estimates were up to 40 years old for the largest female (fork length [FL]: 526 cm) and 73 years old for the largest male (FL: 493 cm). Our results dramatically extend the maximum age and longevity of white sharks compared to earlier studies, hint at possible sexual dimorphism in growth rates, and raise concerns that white shark populations are considerably more sensitive to human-induced mortality than previously thought.

In addition, another cDNA having a sequence similar to that of the cDNAs was screened (atAO-3; 3,049 bp), and a putative AO gene (AC002376) was reported on chromosome 1, which (atAO-4) was distinct from, but very similar to, the above three AOs, atAO-1, 2, 3, and 4 were physically mapped on chromosomes 5, 3, 2 and 1, respectively. These data indicate that there is an AO multigene family in Arabidopsis, atAO-1 protein was shown to be highly similar to one of the maize AOs in respect to a region thought to be involved in determination of substrate specificity, suggesting that they might encode a similar type of AO, which could efficiently oxidize indole-3-acetaldehyde to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), atAO-1 and atAO-2 genes were expressed at higher levels in lower hypocotyls and roots of the wild-type seedlings, while atAO-3 was slightly higher in cotyledons and upper hypocotyls, The expression of atAO-1 was more abundant in the seedlings of an IAA overproducing mutant (superroot1; sur1) than in those of wild type. atAO-2 and atAO-3 transcripts were rather evenly distributed in these seedlings. A possible involvement of atAO genes in phytohormone biosynthesis in Arabidopsis is discussed.

Material/Methods: The sample included 546 women and of these, 519 could be contacted. A questionnaire was con conducted with the women who were included in the study. This included demographic properties, which are thought to affect depression. Subjects were given the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results: In total, 97.7% of women reported that they experienced a problem or had complaints during menopause, while 54.9% reported that they experienced problems in their sexual lives. The mean BDI score of women was 17.01 +/- 8.75. The ratio of women whose total scores were higher than the breakpoint of 17 was 42.2%. Single, widowed, and divorced women had higher ratios than mar married women; primary school or lower education women had higher ratios than high school or low lower education graduate women; the women who reported that they had problems in their sexual lives had higher ratios than the other women within the survey; the women who were subject to vi violence at any time during their lives had higher ratios than the women who had not experienced violence (P<.05). Conclusions: The frequency of depression symptoms in women living in Elazig is high. The information and services that the local women receive about menopause are inadequate.	[Deveci, S.

Combination Therapies for Smoking Cessation A Hierarchical Bayesian Meta-Analysis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE			English	Review							RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY; SUSTAINED-RELEASE BUPROPION; RECEPTOR PARTIAL AGONIST; DOUBLE-BLIND TRIAL; GENERAL-PRACTICE; PRIMARY-CARE; NASAL SPRAY; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT	Context: Treatment guidelines recommend the use of combination therapies for smoking cessation, particularly behavioral therapy (BT) as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy. However, these guidelines rely on previous reviews with important limitations. This study's objective was to evaluate the efficacy of combination therapies compared with monotherapies, using the most rigorous data available. Evidence acquisition: A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of pharmacotherapies, BTs, or both were conducted. The Cochrane Library, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases were systematically searched from inception to July 2015. Inclusion was restricted to RCTs reporting biochemically validated abstinence at 12 months. Direct and indirect comparisons were made in 2015 between therapies using hierarchical Bayesian models. Evidence synthesis: The search identified 123 RCTs meeting inclusion criteria (60,774 participants), and data from 115 (57,851 participants) were meta-analyzed. Varenicline with BT increased abstinence more than other combinations of a pharmacotherapy with BT (varenicline versus bupropion: OR = 1.56, 95% credible interval [CrI] = 1.07, 2.34; varenicline versus nicotine patch: OR = 1.65, 95% CrI = 1.10, 2.51; varenicline versus short-acting nicotine-replacement therapies: OR = 1.68, 95% CrI = 1.15, 2.53). Adding BT to any pharmacotherapy compared with pharmacotherapy alone was inconclusive, owing to wide CrIs (OR = 1.17, CrI = 0.60, 2.12). Nicotine patch with short-acting nicotine-replacement therapy appears safe and increases abstinence versus nicotine-replacement monotherapy (OR = 1.63, CrI = 1.06, 3.03). Data are limited concerning other pharmacotherapy combinations and their safety and tolerability. Conclusions: Evidence suggests that combination therapy benefits may be less than previously thought. Combined with BT, varenicline increases abstinence more than other pharmacotherapy with BT combinations. (C) 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Ge, XY				Ge, Xianyun			Smart Payment Contract Mechanism Based on Blockchain Smart Contract Mechanism	SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING			English	Article								In recent years, blockchain technology has become a hot topic in various industries. With the development and maturity of blockchain technology, it has been applied to finance, law, etc., with its advantages of decentralization, openness, information security, and concealment. The application scenarios of industry are becoming more and more abundant. Compared with the traditional TPA payment contract form, the smart contract mechanism based on blockchain technology is obviously more efficient, convenient, and safe. Against this background, we design a smart payment contract suitable for cloud storage by studying Ethereum. The relationship clause in the smart payment contract should be regulated around the contract law. The smart contract payment linkage clause can be classified into three forms, including conditional effective type, contract joint type, and contract link type, which correspond to the contract law. Therefore, the contract legal system for smart contract payment linkage clauses should follow typified thinking. Based on blockchain technology, smart contracts not only reduce the number of interactions in contract execution but also allow users to stop paying for cloud services when data is lost or damaged. The precise method is to generate each node with a private chain and place the smart contract on the private chain. With the decentralization of the blockchain private chain, the advantages of read-only data, and traceability of information, the storage of smart payment contract data is more secure. Both parties to the transaction are more trustworthy. Therefore, the proposed system has a safe and efficient smart contract payment mechanism, which brings a good user experience to users, which proves the significance and value of this research.

J	Boyd, G; Jaworski, WM				Boyd, Gary; Jaworski, Wojciech M.			Software and viable systems development with "j-Maps" models and learning conversations	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Cybernetics; Computer software; Modelling; Systems software; Systems and control theory		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explain to educators and system developers the novel systemic instructional methodology and tools which the use to improve students' learning about and development of viable ventures and reliable software systems. This methodology is used to counteract impetuous detail-focussed thinking. For example, it has been evident that students often compromise their learning and their design work by failing to take large enough, or systemic enough, long-term perspectives. Rarely, do they grasp the need for finding and discussing multiple alternative and contextually well-situated strategies prior to their attempts at designing systems or plunging into the generation of software code. Design/methodology/approach - Both analytic narratives of intentionality and executable prototype models have essential roles to play in learning about and designing systems, and this paper explains how these can be integrated. This is done by three parallel learning-conversations: about why we are learning this?; about what is really going on here?; and about which learning strategies (meta-cognitive strategies) to use. These conversations are carried on at the same time as cybersystemic modelling which often involves the building of a canonical formal representation of entities, relationships and transformations, making possible the running of simulations. The modelling is done using Jaworski's "j-Maps (TM)" notation (from which various specialized views can be generated by the "CONTEXT +"(TM) - tools as needed). This is done in order to assess the completeness, correctness and requisite control variety aspects of actual and prospective viable systems and software. Findings - It has been found by carefully triangulated observations over two decades of using successive versions of this methodology that graduate students who work through these activities with this notational technology, develop deeper understanding, produce more reliable software and develop more viable systems. Originality/value - The paper is of value in presenting context map as an advanced, powerful and easy-to-implement method for information representation and transformation and systems development.

Design A survey that included a discrete choice experiment. The survey design was informed using policy documents, social media analysis and input from remote think-aloud interviews with members of the public (n=23). Setting A nationwide survey across the four nations of the UK using an online panel between 29 October and 12 December 2020. Participants Individuals who are over 18 years old. A total of 4120 adults completed the survey (1112 in England, 848 in Northern Ireland, 1143 in Scotland and 1098 in Wales). Primary outcome measure Adult's preferences for, and trade-offs between, type of lockdown restrictions, length of lockdown, postponement of routine healthcare, excess deaths, impact on the ability to buy things and unemployment. Results The majority of adults are willing to accept higher excess deaths if this means lockdowns that are less strict, shorter and do not postpone routine healthcare. On average, respondents in England were willing to accept a higher increase in excess deaths to have less strict lockdown restrictions introduced compared with Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, respectively. In all four countries, one out of five respondents were willing to reduce excess deaths at all costs. Conclusions The majority of the UK population is willing to accept the increase in excess deaths associated with introducing less strict lockdown restrictions. The acceptability of different restriction scenarios varies according to the features of the lockdown and across countries. Governments can use information about trade-off preferences to inform the introduction of different lockdown restriction levels and design compensation policies that maximise societal welfare.

Assessments of the performance of UEMs, however, have been criticised for low validity and limited reliability. The present study extends this critique by describing seven dogmas in recent work on UEMs. The dogmas include using inadequate procedures and measures for assessment, focusing on win-lose outcomes, holding simplistic models of how usability evaluators work, concentrating on evaluation rather than on design and working from the assumption that usability problems are real. We discuss research approaches that may help move beyond the dogmas. In particular, we emphasise detailed studies of evaluation processes, assessments of the impact of UEMs on design carried out in real-world systems development and analyses of how UEMs may be combined.

Case Finland	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						Ecosystem services; Experiential knowledge; Local development; Collaborative planning; Urban planning	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; DECISION-MAKING; CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; CULTURAL-VALUES; KNOWLEDGE; POLICY; PARTICIPATION; BIODIVERSITY; LANDSCAPE; POLITICS	In collaborative urban planning, one of the key questions is how the input from residents' participation can be integrated into planning and decision-making. In the planning of the urban green infrastructure, this input is necessary for understanding how residents experience and value their living environment. Use of this input is particularly challenging, however, because of the prominent role of ecological expert information. In this study, we investigate how public officials, decision-makers and stakeholders see the role of the input produced by residents' participation in informing the planning of the urban green infrastructure. We consider (1) how these actors see the role of residents' experiences, as compared to ecological information, in informing planning and (2) what kind of roles residents' input can play in informing and thereby improving the planning processes. In the Helsinki metropolitan region, Finland, data were obtained using 33 semi-structured expert interviews conducted with officials, decision-makers and stakeholders, including as representatives of residents members of resident or nature associations and landowners. We present a typology of ways of thinking concerning the role of residents' experiences and ecological issues in planning and a typology of the roles of resident's input in improving planning. The use of residents' input has the potential to improve planning in many ways, but its use remains case-dependent. Our findings could generate further discussion on (1) the implications of diverse conceptions of relevant knowledge in planning and (2) the design of collaborative processes in which residents' input is an integral part of urban planning.

So far there is no effective drug to treat the disease. The pathological changes of AD began 30 years before symptoms, so early diagnosis is considered to be important for AD treatment. Integrating diagnosis and therapy into a single regent has provided a new opportunity for AD treatment. Given that metal dyshomeostasis is thought to be one of the key factors to cause AD, a Schiff base substituted coumarin (probe 1) has been designed and synthesized as a selective metal chelator for multi-factor anti-AD in this work. The results of metal ions recognition showed that probe 1 had high selective fluorescent turn-on response to Al3+ and fluorescent turn-off response to Cu2+, due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism. Meanwhile, the results of both in vitro and in vivo bioactivities evaluation including metal chelation, reactive oxide species (ROS) elimination, self-/Cu2+-induced All aggregation showed that 1 and 1-Cu(II) complex had excellent synergistic anti-AD activities. In addition, 1 had low cytotoxicity and was predicted to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Noticeably, X-ray single crystal diffraction of 1-Cu(II) provided molecular level information to explain the structure and theranostic activity relationship. To sum up, 1 may be a promising candidate for the development of AD theranostic agent.

J	Takahashi, K; Kitamura, Y				Takahashi, Kyo; Kitamura, Yayoi			Disaster anxiety and self-assistance behaviours among persons with cervical cord injury in Japan: a qualitative study	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							PREPAREDNESS; CHILDREN; HEALTH; CARE; MANAGEMENT; EARTHQUAKE; FAMILIES; NEEDS; LIFE	Objectives: Persons with disabilities, especially those with a severe disability, have a vague anxiety about future disasters; however, the measures of self-assistance for disaster preparedness have not been standardised. The present study aimed to describe disaster-related anxiety and behaviours related to disaster preparedness among persons who have cervical cord injury in Japan. Design: Qualitative study. Setting: Tokyo Metropolitan area, Japan. Participants: 16 persons with cervical cord injury participated. Inclusion criteria were being 20 years old and older, being diagnosed with cervical cord injury, being able to communicate verbally, having an interest in disaster preparedness, and belonging to a self-help group of persons with cervical cord injury in the Tokyo Metropolitan area. Results: Participants usually had 'anxiety about health management' and it became more serious once they thought about a disaster. We identified three themes in relation to their anxiety: 'storing needed items,' 'staying in a safe place' and 'having reliable caregivers.' We also identified three other themes that were the reasons behind these themes: 'travel experiences,' 'experiences of failure' and 'information from peers.' Conclusions: To buffer the anxiety about health management in a disaster, it would be important for persons with cervical cord injury to store needed items, stay in a safe place and have reliable caregivers. Various daily experiences, including experiences of failure, would encourage such behaviours.

J	Zylberberg, A				Zylberberg, Ariel			Decision prioritization and causal reasoning in decision hierarchies	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							OBSERVABLE MARKOV-PROCESSES; EVIDENCE INTEGRATION; INFORMATION-SEEKING; CONFIDENCE; NEURONS; MOTION; PROBABILITY; DIRECTION; ACCURACY; HUMANS	Author summaryComplex decisions are often broken down into a sequence of information-gathering actions followed by reward-seeking actions. For example, a physician may conduct a series of tests to diagnose a patient's disease before suggesting a corrective action. How do people decide what is the appropriate question (test, experiment, query) to ask next? Human participants were presented with a binary decision tree that bifurcated three times. They could solicit information from the bifurcation points to gather noisy evidence about the location of a target. We identified the heuristics that people used to plan efficiently in this complex task. Participants exploited the hierarchical structure of the task and relied on the confidence in past decision to inform the selection of subsequent actions. Our results bear on how people plan efficiently in large partially observable domains, and have implications for the design of artificial agents that have to make decisions with active exploration and for neurophysiological studies of planning in humans and other animals. From cooking a meal to finding a route to a destination, many real life decisions can be decomposed into a hierarchy of sub-decisions. In a hierarchy, choosing which decision to think about requires planning over a potentially vast space of possible decision sequences. To gain insight into how people decide what to decide on, we studied a novel task that combines perceptual decision making, active sensing and hierarchical and counterfactual reasoning. Human participants had to find a target hidden at the lowest level of a decision tree. They could solicit information from the different nodes of the decision tree to gather noisy evidence about the target's location. Feedback was given only after errors at the leaf nodes and provided ambiguous evidence about the cause of the error. Despite the complexity of task (with 10(7) latent states) participants were able to plan efficiently in the task. A computational model of this process identified a small number of heuristics of low computational complexity that accounted for human behavior. These heuristics include making categorical decisions at the branching points of the decision tree rather than carrying forward entire probability distributions, discarding sensory evidence deemed unreliable to make a choice, and using choice confidence to infer the cause of the error after an initial plan failed. Plans based on probabilistic inference or myopic sampling norms could not capture participants' behavior. Our results show that it is possible to identify hallmarks of heuristic planning with sensing in human behavior and that the use of tasks of intermediate complexity helps identify the rules underlying human ability to reason over decision hierarchies.

Solid-state reactivity explored <i>in situ</i> by synchrotron radiation on single crystals: from SrFeO<sub>2.5</sub> to SrFeO<sub>3</sub> via electrochemical oxygen intercalation	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article						in situ diffraction; non-stoichiometric oxides; synchrotron radiation; diffuse scattering; twinning; chemical reactivity of solids; electrochemistry	X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; NEUTRON-DIFFRACTION; LOW-TEMPERATURE; MAGNETIC-STRUCTURE; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; LATTICE-DYNAMICS; OXIDE; DIFFUSION; SR2FE2O5; SYSTEM	In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of following up a chemical reaction by single crystal x-ray (synchrotron) diffraction under operando conditions, carried out in a specially designed electrochemical cell mounted on the BM01A at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). We investigated in detail the electrochemical oxidation of SrFeO2.5 to SrFeO3 on a spherical single crystal of 70 mu m diameter by in situ diffraction at an ambient temperature. Complete data sets were obtained by scanning the whole reciprocal space using a 2M Pilatus detector, resulting in 3600 frames with a resolution of 0.1 degrees per data set, each obtained in 18 min. The crystal was mounted in a specially designed electrochemical cell with 1N KOH used as the electrolyte. During the electrochemical oxidation, the reaction proceeds following the phase sequence SrFeO2.5/SrFeO2.75/SrFeO2.875/SrFeO3, structurally accompanied by establishing a complex series of long-range oxygen vacancy ordering, which gets instantly organized at ambient temperature. The topotactic reaction pathway is discussed in terms of the evolution of the twin domain structure. The formation of SrFeO2.875 is accompanied by the formation of diffuse streaks along the [1 0 0]-direction of the perovskite cell, reaching high d-spacings. The diffuse streaks are discussed and are thought to originate from a modified twin structure induced by the SrFeO2.75 to SrFeO2.875 transition, and the associated changes in the domain structure, developed during the oxygen intercalation. We equally analysed and discussed in detail the twin structure of all the title compounds. We confirm the ground state of SrFeO2.5 is able to adopt the Imma space group symmetry, showing stacking faults of the tetrahedral layers along the stacking axis of the brownmillerite unit cell, indicated by the 1D diffuse rods. We showed that in situ single crystal diffraction has huge potential in the study of non-stoichiometric compounds under operando conditions, in order to obtain structural information i.e. about diffuse scattering, and microstructural information related to domain effects such as twinning-information far beyond that which powder diffraction methods allow us to obtain.

J	Chen, CM; Li, MC; Chen, TC				Chen, Chih-Ming; Li, Ming-Chaun; Chen, Tze-Chun			A web-based collaborative reading annotation system with gamification mechanisms to improve reading performance	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Cooperative/collaborative learning; Learning environments; Teaching/learning strategies	DESIGN-BASED RESEARCH; MULTIMEDIA ANNOTATION; CRITICAL THINKING; STUDENTS; GAME; IMMERSION; TOOL; COMPREHENSION; ENGAGEMENT; EXPERIENCE	This study presents a web-based collaborative reading annotation system (WCRAS) with gamification mechanisms to motivate students' annotations behaviors and promote students' reading comprehension performance. The research participants were 55 fifth grade students from two classes of an elementary school in northeastern Taiwan. A quasi-experimental design was adopted to evaluate the effects of the experimental and control groups respectively using WCRAS with and without gamification mechanisms to support digital reading on students' annotation behaviors, collaborative interaction relationship, reading comprehension performance, and immersion experience. The results showed that the experimental group made significantly more annotations across almost all types of reading annotations and response annotations and had a significantly higher degree of immersive experience and social interaction than the control group. However, the difference in reading comprehension performance between the two groups has not been found. In addition, although the experimental group provided more amounts of high-quality annotations, the group did not generate more quantity of annotations related to reading comprehension aspects assessed by PIRLS. These research findings indicate that a gap between the promotion of the quantity and quality of participation and learning outcomes exists. This study is significant to address the need that designs the gamification mechanisms to encourage high-quality annotations that can effectively enhance students' reading comprehension. To better associate game features and learning performance in the WCRAS with gamification mechanisms, future studies are suggested to promote both annotation quality and connection between reading achievement and gamification mechanisms.

Knowledge Translation in Men's Health Research: Development and Delivery of Content for Use Online	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						men's health; knowledge translation; development of online content	BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS; PATIENT SATISFACTION; SYSTEMS THINKING; DECISION-MAKING; PROSTATE-CANCER; WEB 2.0; DEPRESSION; PREGNANCY; INTERNET; SUPPORT	Background: Men can be hard to reach with face-to-face health-related information, while increasingly, research shows that they are seeking health information from online sources. Recognizing this trend, there is merit in developing innovative online knowledge translation (KT) strategies capable of translating research on men's health into engaging health promotion materials. While the concept of KT has become a new mantra for researchers wishing to bridge the gap between research evidence and improved health outcomes, little is written about the process, necessary skills, and best practices by which researchers can develop online knowledge translation. Objective: Our aim was to illustrate some of the processes and challenges involved in, and potential value of, developing research knowledge online to promote men's health. Methods: We present experiences of KT across two case studies of men's health. First, we describe a study that uses interactive Web apps to translate knowledge relating to Canadian men's depression. Through a range of mechanisms, study findings were repackaged with the explicit aim of raising awareness and reducing the stigma associated with men's depression and/or help-seeking. Second, we describe an educational resource for teenage men about unintended pregnancy, developed for delivery in the formal Relationship and Sexuality Education school curricula of Ireland, Northern Ireland (United Kingdom), and South Australia. The intervention is based around a Web-based interactive film drama entitled "If I Were Jack". Results: For each case study, we describe the KT process and strategies that aided development of credible and well-received online content focused on men's health promotion. In both case studies, the original research generated the inspiration for the interactive online content and the core development strategy was working with a multidisciplinary team to develop this material through arts-based approaches. In both cases also, there is an acknowledgment of the need for gender and culturally sensitive information. Both aimed to engage men by disrupting stereotypes about men, while simultaneously addressing men through authentic voices and faces. Finally, in both case studies we draw attention to the need to think beyond placement of content online to delivery to target audiences from the outset. Conclusions: The case studies highlight some of the new skills required by academics in the emerging paradigm of translational research and contribute to the nascent literature on KT. Our approach to online KT was to go beyond dissemination and diffusion to actively repackage research knowledge through arts-based approaches (videos and film scripts) as health promotion tools, with optimal appeal, to target male audiences. Our findings highlight the importance of developing a multidisciplinary team to inform the design of content, the importance of adaptation to context, both in terms of the national implementation context and consideration of gender-specific needs, and an integrated implementation and evaluation framework in all KT work.

Unbiased transcriptional analyses of how neonate larvae cope with these induced plant defenses are lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings: We created cDNA microarrays for Manduca sexta and Heliothis virescens separately, by spotting normalized midgut-specific cDNA libraries created from larvae that fed for 24 hours on MeJA-elicited wild-type (WT) Nicotiana attenuata plants. These microarrays were hybridized with labeled probes from neonates that fed for 24 hours on WT and isogenic plants progressively silenced in JA-mediated defenses (N: nicotine; N/PI: N and trypsin protease inhibitors; JA: all JA-mediated defenses). H. virescens neonates regulated 16 times more genes than did M. sexta neonates when they fed on plants silenced in JA-mediated defenses, and for both species, the greater the number of defenses silenced in the host plant (JA. N/PI. N), the greater were the number of transcripts regulated in the larvae. M. sexta larvae tended to down-regulate while H. virescens larvae up-and down-regulated transcripts from the same functional categories of genes. M. sexta larvae regulated transcripts in a diet-specific manner, while H. virescens larvae regulated a similar suite of transcripts across all diet types. Conclusions/Significance: The observations are consistent with the expectation that specialists are better adapted than generalist herbivores to the defense responses elicited in their host plants by their feeding. While M. sexta larvae appear to be better adapted to N. attenuata's defenses, some of the elicited responses remain effective defenses against both herbivore species. The regulated genes provide novel insights into larval adaptations to N. attenuata's induced defenses, and represent potential targets for plant-mediated RNAi to falsify hypotheses about the process of adaptation.

The moderating effects of need-for-cognition and relationship strength	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						COVID-19 preventive measures; Elaboration likelihood model; Need for cognition; Restaurant dine-in intentions	SOURCE CREDIBILITY; SELF-VALIDATION; PERSUASION; INFORMATION; RESPONSES; ANTECEDENTS	PurposeDoes every customer respond in the same way to restaurants' preventive measures (PM)? To answer this question, the purpose of the present study was to examine the moderating role of need-for-cognition (NC) and customer-restaurant relationship strength (RS) in the impact of restaurants' PM on dine-in intentions using a trust (Study 1) and psychological discomfort (Study 2) as mediators. Design/methodology/approachTwo studies were conducted using a 2 (PM: present vs control) x 2 (RS: strong vs weak) factorial design. NC was treated as a continuous variable in the regression model. FindingsThe results of two experimental studies showed that people with a high NC are more likely to show positive responses (higher trust and less discomfort) to restaurants' PM when they have strong relationships with the restaurant. In contrast, people with a low NC did not show any interaction between PM and RS for trust and discomfort. Practical implicationsFor restaurants targeting people with a high NC and with more returning customers than new customers, the study results suggest that safety measures should be promoted. Originality/valueThe present study expands the knowledge of customers' reactions to restaurants' PM by using the theoretical foundation of the ELM. The results of this study contribute to hospitality research by demonstrating the differences in customers' thought processes according to their NC and the strength of their relationship with the restaurant.

In this regard, lipid-based carrier system might have been regarded as prime delivery systems that are very close to the naturally cell-derived vesicles used for biomolecular communication among cells from occasionally remote tissues. Upon examination of the literature, we found a chasm between groups of investigations in drug pharmaceutics and thought that maybe holistic research could provide better information with respect to drug delivery inside the body, especially when they are going to be injected directly into the bloodstream for systemic distribution. While a collection of older research in most cases dealt with the determination of drug partition coefficient between the aqueous and cell membrane compartments, the link has been overlooked in newer investigations that were mostly focused on drug formulation optimization and their association with particle biodistribution. This gap in the literature motivated us to present the current opinion paper, in which drug physicochemical properties like drug lipophilicity/hydrophilicity is considered as an important element in designing drug-carrying liposomes or micelles. How a hypothetical high throughput cell-embedded chromatographic technique might help to investigate a nanocarrier tissue distribution and to design 'multi-epitope grafted lipid-based drug carrier systems' are discussed. Whenever we would need support for our opinions, we have provided analogy from hydrophobic biomolecules like cholesterol, steroid hormones, and sex hormones and encouraged readers to consider our principle hypothesis: If these molecules could reach their targets far away from the site of production, then a large list of hydrophobic drugs could be delivered to their targets using the same principles.

Our study aimed to use baseline (pre-intervention) community readiness scores to assist with the development of obesity prevention strategies, and to assess changes in community readiness over time (pre/post-intervention), to provide evidence of intervention impact. Method: Our study was located in a rural and remote area of Victoria, Australia. Community readiness was part of a broader obesity prevention intervention designed to create healthier food and physical activity environments through the combination of systems thinking and collaborative community-led solutions. Interviews were conducted using the community readiness to change tool in 2016 (pre) and 2018 (post) with a community representative sample. Baseline data informed the development of community relevant strategies and the pre/post results formed part of the overall evaluation. Results: The tool generated both quantitative and qualitative (quotes) data. A final readiness score was calculated that corresponded to one of the nine stages of readiness. Four of the five domains of the community readiness to change tool showed statistically significant improvements over time (p < 0.05): knowledge of effort, knowledge of issue, community climate, and leadership. The resources domain that did not improve pre/post intervention. Conclusion: Community readiness to change interviews, pre- and post-intervention, provided essential information related to the appropriate targeting and pitch of the prevention strategies, as well as providing an overall evaluation of the positive movement in the community's readiness to implement change.

Alterations to RSNs have been proposed to underpin various kinds of psychopathology, including the occurrence of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). This review outlines the main hypotheses linking AVH and the resting state, and assesses the evidence for alterations to intrinsic connectivity provided by studies of resting fMRI in AVH. The influence of hallucinations during data acquisition, medication confounds, and movement are also considered. Despite a large variety of analytic methods and designs being deployed, it is possible to conclude that resting connectivity in the left temporal lobe in general and left superior temporal gyrus in particular are disrupted in AVH. There is also preliminary evidence of atypical connectivity in the default mode network and its interaction with other RSNs. Recommendations for future research include the adoption of a common analysis protocol to allow for more overlapping datasets and replication of intrinsic functional connectivity alterations.

J	Wang, CG; Hu, ZX; Bao, ZK				Wang, Chenguang; Hu, Zixin; Bao, Zongke			Evaluation of the government entrepreneurship support by a new dynamic neutrosophic operator based on time degrees	MANAGEMENT DECISION			English	Article						Government entrepreneurship support; Dynamic neutrosophic set; Single valued neutrosophic number; Aggregation model; Multiple-attribute decision-making; Dynamic neutrosophic weighted geometric operator; Time degrees	ATTRIBUTE DECISION-MAKING; INTUITIONISTIC FUZZY-SETS; AGGREGATION; INTENTIONS; GROWTH	Purpose Entrepreneurship as a development engine has a distinct character in the economic growth of countries. Therefore, governments must support entrepreneurship in order to succeed in the future. The best way to improve the performance of this entrepreneurial advocacy is through efficient measurement methods. For this reason, the purpose of this paper is to propose a new integrated dynamic multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) model based on neutrosophic set (NS) for assessment of the government entrepreneurship support. Design/methodology/approach Due to the nature of entrepreneurship issues, which are multifaceted and full of uncertain, indeterminate and ambiguous dimensions, this measurement requires multi-criteria decision-making methods in spaces of uncertainty and indeterminacy. Also, due to the change in the size of indicators in different periods, researchers need a special type of decision model that can handle the dynamics of indicators. So, in this paper, the authors proposed a dynamic neutrosophic weighted geometric operator to aggregate dynamic neutrosophic information. Furthermore, in view of the deficiencies of current dynamic neutrosophic MADM methods a compromised model based on time degrees was proposed. The principle of time degrees was introduced, and the subjective and objective weighting methods were synthesized based on the proposed aggregated operator and a nonlinear programming problem based on the entropy concept was applied to determine the attribute weights under different time sequence. Findings The information of ten countries with the indicators such as connections (C), the country's level of education and experience (EE), cultural aspects (CA), government policies (GP) and funding (F) over four years was gathered and the proposed dynamic MADM model to assess the level of entrepreneurial support for these countries. The findings show that the flexibility of the model based on decision-making thought and we can see that the weights of the criteria have a considerable impact on the final evaluations. Originality/value In many decision areas the original decision information is usually collected at different periods. Thus, it is necessary to develop some approaches to deal with these issues. In the government entrepreneurship support problem, the researchers need tools to handle the dynamics of indicators in neutrosophic environments. Given that this issue is very important, nonetheless as far as is known, few studies have been done in this area. Furthermore, in view of the deficiencies of current dynamic neutrosophic MADM making methods a compromised model based on time degrees was proposed. Moreover, the presented neutrosophic aggregation operator is very suitable for aggregating the neutrosophic information collected at different periods. The developed approach can solve the several problems where all pieces of decision information take the form of neutrosophic information collected at different periods.

J	de Rooij, A				de Rooij, Alwin			Inner Speaking and Uncertainty during Idea Generation	JOURNAL OF CREATIVE BEHAVIOR			English	Article						creativity; idea generation; inner speaking; self-regulation; uncertainty	SELF-TALK; CREATIVITY; SPEECH; THINKING; PHENOMENOLOGY; THOUGHT	Inner speaking, the production, and experience of verbal language without any audible vocalization is a critical component of inner experience and imagination. The role that (un)certainty plays in idea generation might explain the unique ways in which idea generation is characterized and affected by different types of inner speech. To explore this open problem, an experiment with a within-subject design (n = 202) was conducted. The results suggested that certainty about the potential of selected information for generating original and useful ideas, elicited using creativity instructions, caused increased self-reinforcement, self-management, and simulation of social interactions with imagined others by inner speaking, but did influence self-critical inner speaking. Self-reinforcing inner speaking, and possibly the simulation of social interactions, subsequently affected the degree of originality and usefulness participants attributed to their ideas. Herewith, the present study contributes novel insight into how inner speaking characterizes and affects idea generation.

J	Flinn, MV				Flinn, MV			Culture and the evolution of social learning	EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Review						culture; evolution; learning; psychological mechanisms; social competition	REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; NATURAL-SELECTION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; COGNITIVE ETHOLOGY; HUMAN SOCIOBIOLOGY; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; CARIBBEAN VILLAGE; HUMAN-POPULATIONS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; ACHE FORAGERS	Applications of modern evolutionary theory to human culture have generated several different theoretical approaches that challenge traditional anthropological perspectives. ''Cultural selection'' and ''mind parasite'' theories model culture as an independent evolutionary system because transmission of cultural traits via social learning is distinct from transmission of genes via DNA replication, ''Dual-inheritance'' and ''co-evolution'' theories model culture as an intermediary evolutionary process that involves information from two inheritance systems: genetics and social learning, ''Evolutionary psychology'' theories emphasize that the evolutionary history of natural selection on mental processes links culture and biological adaptation; hence, cultural information is viewed as part of the organic phenotype and not an independent evolutionary system, Cross-cultural universals and scenarios of the ''environment of evolutionary adaptedness'' are used to identify characteristics of the ''evolved mind'' (human nature). ''Behavioral ecology'' theories examine relations between behavior and environmental context, Behavioral/cultural variations are viewed as products of flexible decision-making processes (evolved mind) that may respond adaptively to micro-environmental differences, It is difficult to devise empirical tests that distinguish among these theories, because they share many basic premises and make similar predictions about human behavior. Indeed, some of the apparent differences may be more semantic than substantive. Social learning is the key process underlying these evolutionary paradigms, Here I argue that human learning mechanisms are products of natural selection, and hence process information in ways that reflect evolutionary design, I review common objections to this hypothesis, including (1) learning processes are uncoupled from genetics and biological adaptation; (2) culture (or its effects) is partly extrasomatic; (3) culture, by most definitions, involves mental phenomena, including conscious thought; (4) culture involves the use of arbitrary symbols to communicate information; (5) culture appears to have emergent properties at the group level, such as shared values and beliefs resulting in political and religious institutions; (6) culture involves historical processes; and (7) complex culture is uniquely human-we need an explanation for why the human species alone evolved such extensive social learning aptitudes. I suggest that these controversies can be resolved, although empirical tests are difficult. I posit that social competition was a primary selective pressure on human mental abilities (Alexander 1989) and that this favored domain-general, constructivist learning capabilities (e.g., Quartz and Sejnowski, in press) that can manage context-dependent analysis and integrate information from domain-specific mechanisms (Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994; MacDonald 1991; Sperber 1996). Humans are unique in the extraordinary levels of novelty that are generated by the processing of socially learned information. Human culture is cumulative; human cognition produces new ideas built upon the old. To a degree that far surpasses that of any other species, human mental processes must contend with a constantly changing information environment of their own creation. Cultural information may be especially dynamic because it is a fundamental aspect of human social competition. Apparently arbitrary changes in cultural traits, such as clothing styles, music, art, food, dialects, and so forth, may reflect information arms races among social competitors. The remarkable developmental plasticity and cross domain integration of some cognitive mechanisms may be products of selection for special sensitivity to variable social context. Human ''culture'' is not just a pool or source of information; it is an arena and theater of social manipulation and competition. Studies of human behavior-including language, kinship, mating relationships, subsistence, economics, and politics-generally are consistent with an evolutionary basis for social learning, but often they fail to add specific new knowledge about the mechanisms. Analyses of cognitive aptitudes underlying language, kinship, and so forth, often are inconclusive because cultural information (and consequent behavior) involves complex interaction among history, environmental variation, ontogenetic pathways of mental processes, and specific context. I suggest that empirical tests of evolutionary culture theory must build upon identification of apparent universals and examine individual variability by incorporating developmental psychology, environmental conditions, and social and historical context. This synthesis would benefit from enhanced cooperation between cognitive psychologists and cultural anthropologists. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

Health management plans for chronic illness need to be integrated, adaptive, contextual, technology aided, patient driven, and designed to address the multilevel social environment of patients' lives. Such primary care-based health management plans are feasible today but will be even more effective and sustainable if supported by systems thinking, technological advances, and policies that create and reinforce home, work, and health care collaborations. Context The current health care system is failing patients with chronic illness, especially those with complex comorbid conditions and social determinants of health challenges. The current system combined with unsustainable health care costs, lack of support for primary care in the United States, and aging demographics create a frightening probable future. Methods Recent developments, including integrated behavioral health, community resources to address social determinants, population health infrastructure, patient-centered digital-health self-management support, and complexity science have the potential to help address these alarming trends. This article describes, first, the opportunity to integrate these trends and, second, a proposal for an integrated, patient-directed, adaptive, contextual, and technology-aided support (ACTS) system, based on a patient's life context and home/primary care/work-setting "support triangle." Findings None of these encouraging trends is a panacea, and although most have been described previously, they have not been integrated. Here we discuss an example of integration using these components and how our proposed model (termed My Own Health Report) can be applied, along with its strengths, limitations, implications, and opportunities for practice, policy, and research. Conclusions This ACTS system builds on and extends the current chronic illness management approaches. It is feasible today and can produce even more dramatic improvements in the future.

Objectives: We assessed the effectiveness of frequent higher dose very early mobilisation (VEM) after stroke. Design: We conducted a parallel-group, single-blind, prospective randomised controlled trial with blinded end-point assessment using a web-based computer-generated stratified randomisation. Setting: The trial took place in 56 acute stroke units in five countries. Participants: We included adult patients with a first or recurrent stroke who met physiological inclusion criteria. Interventions: Patients received either usual stroke unit care (UC) or UC plus VEM commencing within 24 hours of stroke. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was good recovery [modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of 0-2] 3 months after stroke. Secondary outcomes at 3 months were the mRS, time to achieve walking 50 m, serious adverse events, quality of life (QoL) and costs at 12 months. Tertiary outcomes included a dose-response analysis. Data sources: Patients, outcome assessors and investigators involved in the trial were blinded to treatment allocation. Results: We recruited 2104 (UK, n = 610; Australasia, n = 1494) patients: 1054 allocated to VEM and 1050 to UC. Intervention protocol targets were achieved. Compared with UC, VEM patients mobilised 4.8 hours [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1 to 5.7 hours; p < 0.0001] earlier, with an additional three (95% CI 3.0 to 3.5; p < 0.0001) mobilisation sessions per day. Fewer patients in the VEM group (n = 480, 46%) had a favourable outcome than in the UC group (n = 525, 50%) (adjusted odds ratio 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.90; p = 0.004). Results were consistent between Australasian and UK settings. There were no statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes at 3 months and QoL at 12 months. Dose-response analysis found a consistent pattern of an improved odds of efficacy and safety outcomes in association with increased daily frequency of out-of-bed sessions but a reduced odds with an increased amount of mobilisation (minutes per day). Limitations: UC clinicians started mobilisation earlier each year altering the context of the trial. Other potential confounding factors included staff patient interaction. Conclusions: Patients in the VEM group were mobilised earlier and with a higher dose of therapy than those in the UC group, which was already early. This VEM protocol was associated with reduced odds of favourable outcome at 3 months cautioning against very early high-dose mobilisation. At 12 months, health-related QoL was similar regardless of group. Shorter, more frequent mobilisation early after stroke may be associated with a more favourable outcome. Future work: These results informed a new trial proposal [A Very Early Rehabilitation Trial-DOSE (AVERT-DOSE)] aiming to determine the optimal frequency and dose of EM.

Operative Reports <i>Form and Function</i>	ARCHIVES OF SURGERY			English	Article							BILLING DOCUMENTATION; DISCHARGE SUMMARIES; TEMPLATES; ATTENTION; TRIAL	Hypothesis: Little is known about how closely operative reports reflect what was actually performed during an operation, nor has the construction of operative reports been adequately studied with the aims of clarifying the objectives of those reports and improving their efficacy. We hypothesized that if more attention is paid to the objectives of operative reports, their content will more predictably contain the most relevant information, which might channel thinking in beneficial directions during performance of the operation. Design: Multivariate analysis of 250 laparoscopic cholecystectomy operative reports (125 uncomplicated and 125 with bile duct injury). Setting: Academic research. Participants: University (105 cases) and community (145 cases) hospitals. Main Outcome Measures: Variations in content and design of operative reports. Cognitive task analysis of laparoscopic cholecystectomy was conducted, and a model operative report was generated and compared with the actual operative reports. Results: Descriptions of key elements in adequate dissection of the Calot triangle were present in 24.8% and 0.0% of operative reports from uncomplicated and bile duct injury cases, respectively. Thorough dissection of the Calot triangle, identification of the cystic duct infundibulum junction, and lateral retraction of the infundibulum correlated with uncomplicated cases, while irregular cues (eg, perceived anatomic or other deviations) correlated with bile duct injury cases. Conclusions: Current practice generates operative reports that vary widely in content and too often omit important elements. This research suggests that the construction of operative reports should be constrained such that the reports routinely include the fundamental goals of the operation and what was performed to meet them. Cognitive task analysis is based on the ways the mind controls the performance of tasks; it is an excellent method for determining the extra content needed in operative reports. The resulting designs should also serve as mental guidelines to facilitate learning and to enhance the safety of the operation.

J	Hirko, N; Edessa, D; Sisay, M				Hirko, Nigatu; Edessa, Dumessa; Sisay, Mekonnen			Exit-Knowledge of Ambulatory Patients About Medications Dispensed in Government Hospital in Eastern Ethiopia: The Need for Focused Patient Counseling	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						dispensed medications; patient; exit-knowledge; outpatient pharmacy; Federal Harar Police Hospital	HEALTH LITERACY; PHARMACIST; COMMUNICATION; CARE; DRUGS	Background: In the counseling process, a multi-cultural competence of dispenser is among the key factors affecting his/her successful communication with patients for achieving optimal use of medications. For patients to use dispensed drugs appropriately, it is a must for them to understand the medication related information provided by the dispenser. Hence, the objective of this study was to identify parameters that likely affect ambulatory patients' knowledge of medication(s) provided at the exit of outpatient pharmacy of Federal Harar Police Hospital, Eastern Ethiopia. Methods: Cross-sectional study design was employed to conduct this study. An interview of patients was made at the exit of hospital pharmacy using a semi-structured questionnaire. The interview tool primarily assessed the knowledge of the patients for a maximum of three medications provided. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), Version 20.0, was employed for analysis of the data. Chi-squared test was done to retain parameters with potential to have association; and the retained parameters were adjusted by performing bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: The result showed that only 37.2, 33.4 and 28.7% of the patients were able to recall the name of the drug(s), common side effects, and actions to be taken for missed doses, respectively. The likelihood of patients' knowledge for dispensed medications was high among patients aged 19-39 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 5.0; 95% CI: 1.04-24.2) and who thought their communication with dispenser had been polite (AOR: 4.62; 95% CI: 1.48-14.4). However, the knowledge status was found low among patients who were Afan Oromo speakers (AOR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35-0.95) and who came from rural residence (AOR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.25-0.90). Conclusion: A high proportion of patients were unable to recall the drug (s) name, associated common toxicities, and actions to be taken in case of missed dose. In addition, patients who were at early adulthood and who were positive for the politeness of dispenser had better exit-knowledge of their medication. Therefore, for the patients' clear understanding of medications provided, it is mandatory to optimize patient-dispenser communication possibly by adapting multi-cultural communication skills and by providing focused training for dispensers to address factors that likely affect patient-dispenser interactions.

J	Utashiro, N; Williams, CR; Parrish, JZ; Emoto, K				Utashiro, Nao; Williams, Claire R.; Parrish, Jay Z.; Emoto, Kazuo			Prior activity of olfactory receptor neurons is required for proper sensory processing and behavior in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ODORANT RECEPTOR; MOLECULAR-BASIS; VARIABILITY; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS	Animal responses to their environment rely on activation of sensory neurons by external stimuli. In many sensory systems, however, neurons display basal activity prior to the external stimuli. This prior activity is thought to modulate neural functions, yet its impact on animal behavior remains elusive. Here, we reveal a potential role for prior activity in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in shaping larval olfactory behavior. We show that prior activity in larval ORNs is mediated by the olfactory receptor complex (OR complex). Mutations of Oreo, an odorant co-receptor required for OR complex function, cause reduced attractive behavior in response to optogenetic activation of ORNs. Calcium imaging reveals that Orco mutant ORNs fully respond to optogenetic stimulation but exhibit altered temporal patterns of neural responses. These findings together suggest a critical role for prior activity in information processing upon ORN activation in Drosophila larvae, which in turn contributes to olfactory behavior control.

Development and Feasibility of a Web-Based Decision Aid for Patients With Ulcerative Colitis: Qualitative Pilot Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						shared decision making; decision aid; ulcerative colitis	INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; NONADHERENCE; MEDICATION	Background: Shared decision making (SDM) is becoming an important part of ulcerative colitis (UC) management because of the increasing complexity of available treatment choices and their trade-offs. The use of decision aids (DA) may be effective in increasing patients' participation in UC management but their uptake has been limited due to high attrition rates and lack of a participatory approach to their design and implementation. Objective: The primary aim of this study is to explore the perspectives of Australian patients and their clinicians regarding the feasibility and acceptability of myAID, a web-based DA, in informing treatment decisions in UC. The secondary aim is to use the findings of this pilot study to inform the design of a cluster randomized clinical trial (CRCT) to assess the efficacy of the DA compared with usual care. Methods: myAID, a DA was designed and developed using a participatory approach by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, patients, and nonmedical volunteers. A qualitative pilot study to evaluate the DA, involving patients with UC facing new treatment decisions and inflammatory bowel disease clinicians, was undertaken. Results: A total of 11 patients with UC and 15 clinicians provided feedback on myAID. Themes explored included the following: Acceptability and usability of myAID-myAID was found to be acceptable by the majority of clinicians as a tool to facilitate SDM, uptake was thought to vary depending on clinicians' approaches to patient education and practice, potential to overcome time restrictions associated with outpatient clinics was identified, presentation of unbiased information enabling patients to digest information at their own pace was noted, and potential to provoke anxiety among patients with a new diagnosis or mild disease was raised; Perceived role and usefulness of myAID-discordance was observed between patients who prioritized voicing preferences and clinicians who prioritized treatment adherence, and myAID facilitated early discussion of medical versus surgical treatment options; Target population and timing of use-greatest benefit was perceived at the time of initiating or changing treatment and following commencement of immunosuppressive therapy; and Potential concerns and areas for improvement-some perceived that use of myAID may precipitate anxiety by increasing decisional conflict and impact the therapeutic relationship between patient and the clinician and may increase resource requirements. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that patients and clinicians consider myAID as a feasible and acceptable tool to facilitate SDM for UC management. These pilot data have informed a participatory approach to the design of a CRCT, which will evaluate the clinical efficacy of myAID compared with usual care.

In this article, attempts are made to understand the origin of diffraction peaks, particularly of the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP, Q(1)), the principal peak (PP, Q(2)), and the third peak (Q(3)), observed in the measured diffraction patterns of disordered materials whose structure contains tetrahedral motifs. It is confirmed that the FSDP (Q(1)) is not a signature of the formation of a network, because an FSDP is observed in tetrahedral molecular liquids. It is found that the PP (Q(2)) reflects orientational correlations of tetrahedra. Q(3), that can be observed in all disordered materials, even in common liquid metals, stems from simple pair correlations. Moreover, information on the topology of disordered materials was revealed by utilizing persistent homology analyses. The persistence diagram of silica (SiO2) glass suggests that the shape of rings in the glass is similar not only to those in the crystalline phase with comparable density (alpha-cristobalite), but also to rings present in crystalline phases with higher density (alpha-quartz and coesite); this is thought to be the signature of disorder. Furthermore, we have succeeded in revealing the differences, in terms of persistent homology, between tetrahedral networks and tetrahedral molecular liquids, and the difference/similarity between liquid and amorphous (glassy) states. Our series of analyses demonstrated that a combination of diffraction data and persistent homology analyses is a useful tool for allowing us to uncover structural features hidden in halo pattern of disordered materials.

Previous studies have revealed functional abnormalities in the hippocampus in patients with PD compared with healthy control subjects (HC), but no study has reported volume abnormalities in the hippocampus or evaluated minute structural changes in the hippocampus in such patients. We thus investigated volume abnormalities in the subfields of the hippocampus to better understand the neurobiological basis of PD. The hippocampus was extracted from structural brain magnetic resonance images obtained from 38 patients with PD and 38 HC and then segmented into six subfields. The relative volume of each subfield was compared between the two groups. The severity of symptoms was assessed using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) and social functioning was assessed using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale. Our results revealed that patients with PD had a significantly smaller volume of the right cornu ammonis (CA) 2/3 hippocampal subfield compared with HC. No significant associations were found between the volumes of the right CA 2/3 and the PDSS or GAF scores in correlation analyses. In conclusion, CA2/3 is thought to be related to contextual memory function, and our results suggest that this particular hippocampal subfield plays a role in the development of PD symptoms.

Although the neural mechanism for automatically detecting one's own body instability is an important consideration, there have thus far been few functional neuroimaging studies because of the restrictions placed on participants' movements. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural substrate underlying whole body instability, based on the self-recognition paradigm that uses video stimuli consisting of one's own and others' whole bodies depicted in stable and unstable states. Analyses revealed significant activity in the regions which would be activated during genuine unstable bodily states: The right parieto- insular vestibular cortex, inferior frontal junction, posterior insula and parabrachial nucleus. We argue that these right-lateralized cortical and brainstem regions mediate vestibular information processing for detection of vestibular anomalies, defensive motor responding in which the necessary motor responses are automatically prepared/simulated to protect one's own body, and sympathetic activity as a form of alarm response during whole body instability.

Veterinary career ambitions correlate with gender and past experience, with current experience influencing curricular perspectives	VETERINARY RECORD			English	Article							STUDENTS; PROFESSION; GRADUATION; UNIVERSITY; ATTITUDES; MEDICINE; DECISION; FUTURE; ENTRY; WOMEN	The Royal Veterinary College's 'Teaching Quality Survey' was completed by 261 recent graduates (six months after graduation) from 2005 to 2011 (26.8 per cent response rate). The results were used to compare veterinarians' background information with current position and career ambition, and to investigate perceptions of curriculum balance. There was a significant difference between males' and females' current positions and career ambitions with comparatively lower percentages of females in farm animal and farm and equine practices. There was also a significant difference between individuals from different childhood areas; individuals from urban areas preferred small animal practice, in comparison to those from rural areas who are more likely to choose farm animal practices. Compared with their peers, individuals engaged in a specific area of work tend to think that their area was under-represented in the professional curriculum. Taken alongside the feminisation and urbanisation of the profession, the results of this study indicate that food animal careers need to be promoted as an attractive option for new graduates and those going into mixed practice initially. Also, those involved in curriculum design using graduate surveys should take into account the current careers of the respondents in order to avoid biased results.

Schuyler; Kraschnewski, Jennifer			Importance of patient engagement in the conduct of pragmatic multicenter randomized controlled trials: The ADAPTABLE experience	CLINICAL TRIALS			English	Article						Patient engagement; pragmatic trials; randomized trials; patient-centered research; patients	CLINICAL-TRIALS; NETWORK	Background/Aims Actively engaging patient partners in the conduct of trials is crucial to ensure the studies answer genuine, patient-centered, unmet clinical needs, and to facilitate participant recruitment and retention. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the feasibility of patient engagement within a large pragmatic multicenter randomized controlled trial, specifically for the purposes of dissemination of study information/updates and to favorize recruitment and retention. Methods In the patient-centric, pragmatic ADAPTABLE randomized trial, transparent and timely dissemination of information on the study updates to the trial participants was undertaken to create meaningful engagement and to facilitate retention. A national panel of patient partners, the Adaptors, were directly involved in this information dissemination strategy, and study participants were engaged both nationally and locally to design recruitment methods iteratively during the conduct of the trial. All Adaptors had a lived experience with cardiovascular disease. Results Adaptors attended bi-weekly meetings facilitated by the director of the study's patient-powered research network. They drafted and/or edited newsletters and ad hoc educational information written in a lay-friendly manner for study participants, which were regularly distributed to the ADAPTABLE community, in addition to online forums where participants could share their experience of their involvement in ADAPTABLE. To spur recruitment, a patient-driven initiative was to draft letters sharing their story, which were distributed by the local study teams. Patient partners thought that using patients' voice to provide their perspectives on why they believed this project was important would be more engaging for prospective participants than traditional approaches. Conclusions ADAPTABLE's experience has demonstrated the feasibility of engaging patients as partners in the conduct of a large-scale, multi-center, pragmatic randomized controlled trial. Future trials should embrace and iteratively improve this model by engaging patient partners as early as study protocol development and funding applications, and quantify its impact on the effectiveness and value of the trial.

Nurses' perceptions of health beliefs and impact on teaching and practice: a Q-sort study	INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW			English	Article						Argyris and Schon's Theory; Chinese Traditional Medicine; Evidence-Based Practice; Health Beliefs; Patient Education; Q-Methodology; Reflective Practice	Q-METHODOLOGY; SOCIAL MEDIA; CHINESE; CARE; EDUCATION; INFORMATION; COMPETENCE; BEHAVIORS; KNOWLEDGE; ACADEMICS	AimTo understand Chinese nurses' perceptions of health beliefs, their content, origin and the influence of sociocultural factors, as a basis of their evidence-based practice. This study contributes to a larger study to establish the health beliefs of Japanese, Australian, Chinese, South Korean and Thai nurses. BackgroundRegistered nurses teach patients and students about maintaining or attaining health are subject to the same range of influences and their health beliefs may be antithetical to current health evidence. MethodsQ-method design using q-sort and interview was used to explore the perspectives on a range of health beliefs of 60 nurses in four cities in China. FindingsThree factors arose from the perceptions of the participants about health and accounted for 50.2% of the total variance: (1) social impact, (2) the importance of evidence', and (3) beliefs rooted in culture. DiscussionInfluence on nurses' health beliefs was explored in terms of the internalized and frequently unconscious beliefs, values and norms tying them to their communities, reflecting the need for nurses to be aware of their health beliefs and behaviours. ConclusionsEducation for nurses in practice needs to acknowledge that individual practitioners' beliefs strongly influence health teaching for patients and families. In order to implement evidenced-based practice and teach in line with current evidence nurses need to critically examine and reflect on the impact of culture, society and the media on their own health beliefs. Implications for nursing policy and health policyEducation policy needs to consider that culture and societal pressures affect nurses' health beliefs and practice. Critical thinking, reflective and evidence-based practice need to be emphasized in clinical training and nurse education. China also needs to develop policies to allow nurses to be able to assess the reliability of health information on the Internet and to make quality health research more available.

Deep learning architecture using rough sets and rough neural networks	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Classification; Social networks; Deep learning; Decision system; Rough neural networks; Rough sets		Purpose - This paper aims to utilize machine learning and soft computing to propose a new method of rough sets using deep learning architecture for many real-world applications. Design/methodology/approach - The objective of this work is to propose a model for deep rough set theory that uses more than decision table and approximating these tables to a classification system, i.e. the paper propose a novel framework of deep learning based on multi-decision tables. Findings - The paper tries to coordinate the local properties of individual decision table to provide an appropriate global decision from the system. Research limitations/implications - The rough set learning assumes the existence of a single decision table, whereas real-world decision problem implies several decisions with several different decision tables. The new proposed model can handle multi-decision tables. Practical implications - The proposed classification model is implemented on social networks with preferred features which are freely distribute as social entities with accuracy around 91 per cent. Social implications - The deep learning using rough sets theory simulate the way of brain thinking and can solve the problem of existence of different information about same problem in different decision systems Originality/value - This paper utilizes machine learning and soft computing to propose a new method of rough sets using deep learning architecture for many real-world applications.

Design A qualitative design comprising individual in-depth interviews with nurses from a major Australian metropolitan tertiary teaching hospital. Method A purposive sample of 30 Registered Nurses from nine surgical and medical wards were interviewed in April 2018 using semi-structured interviews. An inductive thematic analysis was conducted. Results Identified themes included: detecting the deterioration; countering the problem; getting a response; and challenges faced in the process of escalation. Nurses reported an important awareness, sense of responsibility, and critical thinking to ensure the safe management and escalation of deteriorating patients. However, barriers to escalation necessitated individual workarounds and organizational structures to mitigate patient risk. Conclusion This study supports the importance of communication between clinical teams and recognizes that it is crucial to enable a fail-safe experience for patients and families. Recognition of disciplinary contributions to patients' goals of care is required to better understand and address the prevalence of deteriorating patients. Our study is among the first to explore the actual experience of nurses who articulate balancing uncertainty and managing complex team dynamics on wards for patients experiencing deteriorating health status. The information may assist in determining team training strategies and structures to facilitate patient management during deterioration. Impact This is among the first study to investigate barriers influencing decision-making of RNs prior to escalation using qualitative methods. This study provides a foundation to inform and develop policies and strategies aimed at ensuring escalation occurs for deteriorating patients.

Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: School classroom. Participants: Adolescent male rugby players aged 12 to 18 years (n = 866). Main Outcome Measures: Concussion and BR prevalence, reporting rates, and reporting behaviors. Results: The sample reported a concussion and BR prevalence rate of 40% and 69.9%, respectively. Of these athletes with a history, 38.4% and 86.4% suffered recurrent concussions and BRs, respectively. The total reporting rates per 1000 suspected concussions and BRs were 474.8 [95% confidence interval (CI), 415.4-534.3] and 238.7 (95% CI, 217.8-259.5), respectively. The athletes highlighted several barriers which hindered their truthful reporting of concussion, including "not thinking the injury is serious enough to report" (70%), "wanting to win the game" (38%), and "not wanting to miss future games or training" (48%). Conclusions: Educational interventions are an invaluable component within a socioecological framework aimed at improving the concussion reporting rates of adolescent athletes. The self-recalled prevalence, underreporting rates, and behaviors of the sample are alarming, which prompts the need to further explore their motivational beliefs behind their decision to underreport a potential concussion. The information obtained can be used to tailor personalized interventions for specific athlete samples.

The impact of environmental knowledge acquisition on environmental behavior of Chinese farmers based on social capital perspective	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						social capital; social media; environmental behavior; knowledge acquisition; farmer	WORD-OF-MOUTH; CONTINUANCE INTENTION; CONSUMER RESPONSE; CO2 EMISSIONS; MODEL; MEDIA; COMMUNICATION; LEVEL; IDENTIFICATION; SATISFACTION	With the development of mobile internet, Chinese farmers have started to access diversified information through social media, on one hand, based on breadth of information. On the other hand, as most farmers still live in rural areas, their socio-economic characteristics and lifestyles are in homogeneous acquaintance social network relationships, i.e. interpersonal interactions in offline homogeneous networks are still considered as the way for farmers to access homogeneous information (breadth of information depth). Based on social capital theory, social networks are structural social capital where trust and reciprocity are known as a relational social capital. Further, this study divides structural social capital into connective social capital (social media access to information) and bonding social capital (offline interpersonal interaction access to information) based on the differences in their information sources. The empirical study finds that structural social capital has a positive impact on farmers' environmental knowledge acquisition which influences their environmental behavior. In addition, relational social capital (trust and reciprocity) plays a mediating role in the influence of structural social capital on farmers' environmental behavior.

Developing a patient decision aid for the treatment of women with early stage breast cancer: the struggle between simplicity and complexity	BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Shared decision making; Patient decision aid; Early stage breast cancer; Alpha testing	QUALITY; MASTECTOMY; CRITERIA; SURGERY; SUPPORT; DESIGN	Background: A patient decision aid (PtDA) can support shared decision making (SDM) in preference-sensitive care, with more than one clinically applicable treatment option. The development of a PtDA is a complex process, involving several steps, such as designing, developing and testing the draft with all the stakeholders, known as alpha testing. This is followed by testing in 'real life' situations, known as beta testing, and then finalising the definite version. Our aim was developing and alpha testing a PtDA for primary treatment of early stage breast cancer, ensuring that the tool is considered relevant, valid and feasible by patients and professionals. Methods: Our qualitative descriptive study applied various methods including face-to-face think-aloud interviews, a focus group and semi-structured telephone interviews. The study population consisted of breast cancer patients facing the choice between breast-conserving therapy with or without preceding neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and mastectomy, and professionals involved in breast cancer care in dedicated multidisciplinary breast cancer teams. Results: A PtDA was developed in four iterative test rounds, taking nearly 2 years, involving 26 patients and 26 professionals. While the research group initially opted for simplicity for the sake of implementation, the clinicians objected that the complexity of the decision could not be ignored. Other topics of concern were the conflicting views of professionals and patients regarding side effects, the amount of information and how to present it. Conclusion: The development was an extensive process, because the professionals rejected the simplifications proposed by the research group. This resulted in the development of a completely new draft PtDA, which took double the expected time and resources. The final version of the PtDA appeared to be well-appreciated by professionals and patients, although its acceptability will only be proven in actual practice (beta testing).

A revision of <i>Sanpasaurus yaoi</i> Young, 1944 from the Early Jurassic of China, and its relevance to the early evolution of Sauropoda (Dinosauria)	PEERJ			English	Article						Early Jurassic; China; Middle Jurassic; Sauropoda; Eusauropoda; 'Tulcanodontidae'	PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; YUNNAN PROVINCE; SOUTH-AFRICA; ANATOMY; MELANOROSAURUS; QUADRUPEDALISM; CETIOSAURUS; OSTEOLOGY	The Early Jurassic of China has long, been recognized for its diverse array of sauropodomorph dinosaurs. However, the contribution of this record to our understanding of early sauropod evolution is complicated by a dearth of information on important transitional taxa. We present a revision of the poorly known taxon Sanpasaurus yaoi Young. 1944 from the late Early Jurassic Ziliujing Formation of Sichuan Province, southwest China. Initially described as the remains of an ornithopod ornithischian, we demonstrate that the material catalogued as IVPP V156 is unambiguously referable to Sauropoda. Although represented by multiple individuals of equivocal association, Sanpasaurus is nonetheless diagnosable with respect to an autapomorphic feature of the holotypic dorsal vertebral series. Additional material thought to be collected from the type locality is tentatively referred to Sanpasaurus. If correctly attributed, a second autapomorphy is present in a referred humerus. The presence of a dorsoventrally compressed pedal ungual in Sanpasaurus is of particular interest, with taxa possessing this typically `vulcanodontid' character exhibiting a much broader geographic distribution than previously thought. Furthermore, the association of this trait with other features ofI Sanpasaurus that are broadly characteristic of basal eusauropods underscores the mosaic nature of the early sauropod-eusauropod transition. Our revision of Sanpasaurus has palaeobiogeographic implications for Early Jurassic sauropods, with evidence that the group maintained a cosmopolitan Pangaean distribution.

Integrating real-world settings into the teaching of secondary school students can help to promote problem-solving skills and competencies at younger ages, which is a crucial task in sustainability education. Therefore, in this article we describe the results of a case study on the development of sustainable food products that involved a university and two secondary schools in Austria. The methods used in this case study were drawn from the transdisciplinary case study (TCS) and the PBL literature. Data were collected by carrying out participatory research methods such as photovoice, focus group discussions, food diaries, student evaluations, and surveys. We divided the study design into three phases: (1) exploration, (2) product ideation, and (3) product prototyping and optimisation. The case study illustrates that the use of PBL research approaches by students at different levels of education provides promising results, if the research process is clearly structured and managed. When a demand for learning is encountered by students, secondary school teachers and university researchers must provide the students with additional sources of information. The establishment and management of a transinstitutional research setting is a promising, yet time-consuming endeavour.

Teachers may wonder if their students can attain satisfactory learning performance in an online learning environment without teachers' on-the-spot attention. In order to develop students' skills in programming, promote their enjoyment of learning and intention to learn to program, the researchers integrated two innovative teaching approaches, using online peerfacilitated learning and distributed pair programming, and investigated the effects of these on students' online learning performance. This study conducted an experiment that included 128 undergraduates from four class sections of Department of Finance. Thus, the experimental design in this research was a 2 (Peer-facilitated learning vs. non-peer-facilitated learning) x 2 (Distributed pair programming vs. non-distributed pair programming) factorial pretest/post-test design. The participants in this research mainly consisted of four classes of students from a non-computer or information department who took a compulsory course on programming design.' Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected in this study. According to the results, the peer-facilitated learning group exhibited significantly better development of programming skills, enjoyment of learning, and intention to learn, than the non-peer-facilitated learning group. However, expected effects of enhancing the learning of the students in this study who received the distributed pair programming were not found. The design of online pedagogy can be a reference for online educators. The implications of applying online peerfacilitated learning and distributed pair programming to support students' learning and the design of online programming courses are discussed.

J	Ma, JQ; Yang, JF; Zhang, JH; Fu, FJ				Ma, Jiaqi; Yang, Jinfu; Zhang, Jiahui; Fu, Fuji			Online multiple object tracker with enhanced features	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article						feature fusion; online tracking; kinematic analysis; multiobject tracking		The online multiobject tracking (MOT), which integrates object detection and tracking into a single network, has made breakthroughs in recent years. However, most online trackers have a more monotonous prediction of the tracking offset in two consecutive frames, which may not be reliable when facing extreme situations such as occlusion and object deformation. Once the tracking offset of an object is biased, its corresponding tracklet will no longer maintain temporal consistency, which will seriously affect the tracking performance. In this paper, we propose a new online multiple object tracker with feature enhancement mechanism, namely En-Tracker. In En-Tracker, a multibranch kinematic analysis network (MKANet) is designed to address the above problems. MKANet estimates the pixel offset and instance offset of the object in parallel based on imitating the human thinking to joint position and appearance representations. Note that these two types of offsets compensate and facilitate each other to effectively deal with some extreme scenarios. In addition, we propose a kinematic-assisted feature synthesis enhancement (KFSE) module, which has a more comprehensive enhancement mechanism. Specifically, KFSE propagates previous tracking information to the current frame based on kinematic trend analysis while enhancing the characterization of detection features and appearance embeddings, which not only assists in object detection but also ensures the uniqueness of the appearance embeddings. Extensive experiments on MOT16 and MOT17 verify the effectiveness and advantage of our model.

Intervention of light convolutional neural network in document survey form processing	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Entropy; Form processing; Intersecting cortical model; Lite convolutional neural network; Survey	TEXT; RECOGNITION	Public survey is popular in different domain to have a feedback from service users in the aim to improve the quality of service provided or to figure out what they think. In general, the data processing takes time due of manual intervention and it may distort the result because an error of processing may occur, so the aim of this research is to propose a new finding how to process rapidly a paper survey form to have the statistic result on time. The paper template design must have at least one question with "Yes" and "No" check box or radio button as response field. People have a liberal choice to reply: normal, no response or both. In each box in form can contain a different type of handwriting and the way to recognize them is within mathematics tools combined with neural networks. First of all, the physical paper which contents the information must be converted to image by digitization operation. Any type format of image is accepted then it will be handled by preprocessing module before coming to the Lite Convolutional Neural Network. Once the neural networks finish the treatment, a postprocessing module computes the information and insert into database. The singularity of this technique is the intervention of Lite Convolutional Neural Network as recognition tool which has more advantage compared with standard deep learning in terms of computation time, accuracy/precision and number of parameters. The validation of this approach is done with RVL-CDIP dataset, real survey of mobile money and satellite TV service, the accuracy reaches 96%, 97% and 98% respectively.	[Rafidison, M.

Nevertheless, PTM is often considered a burden for patients, and can be difficult to manage. This study was designed to identify the main medication issues encountered by children and their parents in order to find suitable means to improve their care management. Method Anonymised multifactorial, cross-sectional, single-site survey. Parents of children transplanted from January 2011 were recruited following two strategies: (1) self-completion of questionnaire at the outpatient department over a period of 4 weeks during May 2013, (2) telephone completion by random selection of 30 parents. Results were analysed using MS Excel 2010. Results 37 parents were recruited. Medication supply problems concerned 12 (32.4%) parents. 30 (81.1%) parents declared having almost run out of medicines, but no children missed an immunosuppressant dose. 9 (24.3%) parents experienced medication-administration problems, and 14 (37.8%) blood test issues. 14 (37.8%) parents felt they had an inadequate knowledge of side effects. However, 30 (81.1%) parents thought that their training was excellent or very good, and 36 (97.5%) that the written information provided was comprehensible and accurate. Among proposed improvements, parents' preferences were for an online learning tool (OLT), an explanatory comic book (CB) for children and pharmaceutical consultations (PC). Conclusions To our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive published audit concerning the care process of PTM. Although parents seemed particularly satisfied by the current training and written information, many experienced issues linked to PTM management. Based on parents' preferences, a working party is currently considering service development options (OLT, CB, PC).

We commissioned and designed two survey questions to build on the few studies that delve into Americans' sentiments about these projected shifts. The first item offers more response options than past research to explore popular sentiments about national projections of a "majority-minority" future. The second item asks respondents about which areas of society that they think these changes will affect. The descriptive analyses reveal considerable variation in sentiments about projected demographic futures, with many among this racially diverse sample of adults expressing positive views and few expressing negative views. Multivariate regression analyses indicate that racial attitudes and political partisanship are significantly associated with expressing positive, negative, and other sentiments about future ethnoracial diversity. In addition, Californians indicated that these changes are most likely to affect race relations and politics and political power in the future. These findings point to the salience of the sociopolitical and information environment surrounding how people interpret population data and demographic projections, and hopefully encourages more work in popular demography.

Computational models can account for specific behaviours, but their applicability across sensory and task domains remains untested. Here, we assess the capacity of our previous model (Sun et al. 2020) of visual navigation to generalise to olfactory navigation and its coordination with other guidance in flies and ants. We show that fundamental to this capacity is the use of a biologically plausible neural copy-and-shift mechanism that ensures sensory information is presented in a format compatible with the insect steering circuit regardless of its source. Moreover, the same mechanism is shown to allow the transfer cues from unstable/egocentric to stable/geocentric frames of reference, providing a first account of the mechanism by which foraging insects robustly recover from environmental disturbances. We propose that these circuits can be flexibly repurposed by different insect navigators to address their unique ecological needs.

Although evidence indicates that a polyphenolic-rich diet plays an important role in modulating aspects of chronic inflammation, few studies have focused on the effect of ellagitannin (ET)-rich food consumption on longterm remission maintenance in IBD patients with a high risk of clinical relapse. Therefore, we hypothesize that supplementation with a pomegranate juice, a naturally rich source of ETs, could significantly modulate the markers of mucosal and systemic inflammation relative to a control group receiving a placebo. Methods/design: This double-blind, randomized controlled trial includes patients with IBD involving the colorectum who have been in stable therapy for at least the three previous months and have a high risk of clinical relapse. Participants are randomly allocated to one of two groups: active supplementation (125 mL of cv. Wonderful pomegranate juice) or placebo (125 mL) taken twice daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcome is changes in the fecal neutrophil-derived protein calprotectin, a surrogate marker of mucosal improvement, between the two groups from baseline to 12 weeks later. The secondary outcomes include transcriptomic changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and intestinal biopsies and changes in circulating inflammatory markers and trimethylamine-N-oxide levels. Pomegranate ET-derived metabolites are identified and quantified in plasma and urine samples. Discussion: The results will provide information on the possible reduction of fecal calprotectin levels following the consumption of pomegranate juice. The findings will also show the in vivo metabolism of pomegranate ETs. Finally, the effect of 12-week pomegranate juice consumption on local and systemic inflammatory markers will be elucidated, which will likely provide additional insights into the maintenance of remission in IBD patients.

We explored the links between these variables and compulsive Internet use in a sample of 509 teenagers and adults aged 11 to 67. We inves-tigated the effect of compulsive Internet use on cyberbullying through fake news creation and/or distribution, both direct and via moral disengagement, and the related differences between adults and teenagers. The indirect effect of compulsive Internet use on cyberbullying through moral disengagement was significant in adolescents, but not in adults. As assumed, teenagers scored significantly higher than adults on all the primary variables. Contrary to our expectations, no significant gender differences emerged, regardless of participants' age, in terms of compulsive Internet use, moral disengagement, nor cyberbullying. The results emphasize the importance of relevant online education programs designed to engage both teenagers and adults in critical thinking that might help in the fake news detection process, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This process can be improved with comprehensive assessment tools to provide quantitative information regarding the interdependence of the FEW nexus. A comprehensive framework of the regional FEW nexus quantitative assessment was proposed in this study. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was the core method used to evaluate the FEW inter-linkages. Land use data which can further imply the resources consumption or requirement was introduced to estimate potential changes in the nexus in future time periods. In order to display the practicality of the FEW nexus approach, a user-friendly nexus platform, a GIS-based Regional Environmental Assessment Tool for Food-Energy-Water nexus (GREAT for FEW) (http://greatforfew.enve.ntu.edu.tw/FEW/), was developed with a solid conceptual model, a database, and calculation methods. The usability of the tool was demonstrated using a Taiwanese case study. The results of the Taiwanese case showed that Scenario 1 (non-nuclear homeland policy) caused the lowest environmental impacts as compared to both Scenario 0 (baseline) and Scenario 2 (non-nuclear homeland policy with National Spatial Plan) due to better energy structures and maintenance of agricultural lands. These outcomes indicate that the selection of indicators does affect the results. Therefore, it is suggested that additional indicators should be designed based on the characteristics of the case study area and concerns of stakeholders.

Another goal of the study was to evaluate the classroom climate created by these tools and the method "Think Actively in a Social Context" (TASC) proposed by Wallace and Adams (1993) and framed within project-based learning (PBL). The research was conducted with a sample of 34 students in the third year of a Computer Engineering degree, which, during a period of 15 weeks, required them to design and implement an innovative distributed application project. The procedure consisted of the implementation of the eight phases of the TASC method integrated to the Wikideas and Creativity Connector tools. The information provided by the tools, interviews and questionnaires administered to students were used to analyze our hypothesis. The results show that the tools helped the students to generate, evaluate and select the most relevant ideas and to form teams for project execution. They also revealed that teams with high indexes of creativity and affinity (type a) achieved the best grades in academic performance and project originality. Furthermore, research data show that Wikideas and Creativity Connector along with the TASC approach created a positive classroom climate for students. Based on this work, several suggestions can be extracted on the use of the tools and the TASC method for project-based learning. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Models of feed-forward loops show that the input-output behavior depends critically on the input signal as well as transcription interactions. Models of induction of the lac operon in Escherichia coli reveal the importance of metabolism in determining genetic regulatory network behavior. Combined experimental and computational studies of activation by MarA in E. coli show how mechanisms of transcription regulation, hidden at the level of genetic regulatory networks, can influence behavior. Together these studies illustrate that gene regulation is critically influenced by factors beyond the topology of genetic regulatory interactions. Prediction of the specific information processing roles of gene circuits is more difficult than we would like, but it is still possible. Thinking about evolution of proteins and networks might make it easier. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Membrane properties specialize mammalian inner hair cells for frequency or intensity encoding	ELIFE			English	Article							COCHLEAR INNER; GUINEA-PIG; CALCIUM-DEPENDENCE; TRANSDUCER CURRENT; POTASSIUM CURRENT; PHASE-LOCKING; NERVE-FIBERS; RELEASE; EXPRESSION; CHANNELS	The auditory pathway faithfully encodes and relays auditory information to the brain with remarkable speed and precision. The inner hair cells (IHCs) are the primary sensory receptors adapted for rapid auditory signaling, but they are not thought to be intrinsically tuned to encode particular sound frequencies. Here I found that under experimental conditions mimicking those in vivo, mammalian IHCs are intrinsically specialized. Low-frequency gerbil IHCs (similar to 0.3 kHz) have significantly more depolarized resting membrane potentials, faster kinetics, and shorter membrane time constants than high-frequency cells (similar to 30 kHz). The faster kinetics of low-frequency IHCs allow them to follow the phasic component of sound (frequency-following), which is not required for high-frequency cells that are instead optimally configured to encode sustained, graded responses (intensity-following). The intrinsic membrane filtering of IHCs ensures accurate encoding of the phasic or sustained components of the cell's in vivo receptor potential, crucial for sound localization and ultimately survival.

Usability and feasibility of E-nergEYEze: a blended vision-specific E-health based cognitive behavioral therapy and self-management intervention to reduce fatigue in adults with visual impairment	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Fatigue; Visual impairment; E-health; Cognitive behavioral therapy; Usability; Feasibility	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CANCER; TECHNOLOGIES	Background Over 50% of adults with visual impairment experience severe fatigue. Therefore, we developed a guided E-health intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy and self-management to reduce fatigue in this population. This pilot study evaluated the usability, feasibility, fidelity and potential effectiveness of E-nergEYEze.Methods E-nergEYEze was developed by a design team and customized by conducting a pilot study using an iterative development strategy. The intervention was first tested in a usability study among adults with visual impairment (n = 5). Participants were asked to think-aloud while exploring the intervention features and a semi-structured interview was performed afterwards. Subsequently, the enhanced intervention was tested in a feasibility study. Adults with visual impairment and severe fatigue (n = 10) followed the intervention partially with guidance from a social worker and one-time computer trainer support. Fatigue severity (Checklist Individual Strength), fatigue impact (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) and cognitive behavioral therapy skills (Competencies of Cognitive Therapy Scale-Self Report) were measured at baseline and at three months follow-up and analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The intervention was evaluated through evaluation forms.Results The usability study resulted in adjustments to content and lay-out with regard to optically shortened text sentences, separate pages for information and assignments with one read-aloud audio and an additional descriptive explanation of page content. Digital challenges were overcome with mandatory computer training and e-platform modifications. The feasibility study showed a positive trend in reducing fatigue severity (Z -6.108; P < .001; SD 8.4), impact of fatigue (Z - 4.451; P < .001; SD 11.4) and cognitive behavioral therapy skills (Z -2.278; P = .023; SD 19.3). Participants gave useful feedback regarding accessibility, content and guidance, with an overall positive experience. The intervention was rated with a median score of 8 (range 7-10).Conclusion We developed, evaluated and optimized E-nergEYEze by applying a user-centered and iterative approach. E-nergEYEze showed a promising trend to reduce fatigue severity and impact of fatigue and to increase cognitive behavioral therapy skills. The study methods were feasible and the fidelity of the intervention protocol was suitable. Performing a randomized controlled trial is warranted to give insight into whether E-nergEYEze is cost-effective in reducing severe fatigue in adults with visual impairment.	[Veldman, M. H.

The simulated CGHAZs subjected to thermal cycles with various heat inputs (HIs) (0.8 to 5.0 kJ/mm) were produced using a Gleeble 3500 simulator. The microstructures and corresponding mechanical properties were investigated by means of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, hardness testing, and Charpy V-notch (CVN) testing. The microstructural examination shows that the simulated CGHAZs consisted of a bainite-dominant microstructure and relatively low amount (< 2 pct) of martensite-austenite (M-A) constituent. The prior austenite grain size was controlled to be 45 to 55 A mu m at HIs of 0.8 to 3.5 kJ/mm, and remarkably increased to 85 A mu m at an HI of 5 kJ/mm. The results of CVN testing suggest that superior toughness can be achieved in the studied range of HIs (0.8 to 5 kJ/mm). This is thought to be associated with the combined effects of bainitic microstructure and low M-A fraction as well as comparatively fine austenite grain size in the studied CGHAZs.(C) The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 2015	[Zhu, Zhixiong; Han, Jian; Li, Huijun] Univ Wollongong, Sch Mech Mat & Mechatron Engn, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Han, Jian] Univ Wollongong, Fac Engn & Informat Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia	University of Wollongong; University of Wollongong	Zhu, ZX (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Sch Mech Mat & Mechatron Engn, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.	jh595@uowmail.edu.au		Li, Huijun/0000-0002-2896-3867					40	26	30	0	22	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES	1073-5623	1543-1940		METALL MATER TRANS A	Metall.

J	Li, Y; Khan, AG; Chen, SZ				Li, Yan; Khan, Abdul Gaffar; Chen, Sizhi			Is ambivalent emotion good or bad for creativity? A moderated mediation model of the new construct of emotional stability	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Ambivalent emotion; Creative process engagement; Emotional stability; Creativity; Conservation of resources theory; Informational theories of emotion; Bifurcation model of affect	PROCESS ENGAGEMENT; EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY; CONTEXTUAL FACTORS; NEGATIVE AFFECT; WORK; SELF; LEADERSHIP; MOOD; CONSERVATION; RESILIENCE	Ambivalent situations activate ambivalent emotions (i.e., the simultaneous experience of discrete emotions such as happiness and sadness), which is a ubiquitous phenomenon in organizations. Yet, how and when does ambivalent emotion foster or impede creativity? Unfortunately, prior scholars have largely overlooked the consequences of ambivalent emotion. However, informational theories of emotion deem that ambivalent emotion stimulates more information, which facilitates creativity. On the other hand, another resource depletion perspective thinks ambivalence is a stressful situation that hinders creativity, which demands more psychological resources to identify and solve problems in a new way. Drawing from the lenses of conservation of resources theory (COR), informational theories of emotion, the theory of emotion regulation strategy, and the bifurcation model of affect, a moderated mediation model is developed and found where two facets (i.e., information searching and coding engagement and idea generation engagement) of creative process engagement mediate the association between ambivalent emotion and creativity, in which ambivalent emotion diminishes the two facets of creative process engagement so that results in undermined creativity. And one dimension (i.e., emotion threshold) of a new construct of emotional stability moderated the mediation effect of idea generation engagement in the process, such that this relationship is stronger when emotion threshold is high. This study also reveals that another dimension (i.e., emotion recovery) of the new emotional stability positively relates to creativity. We test and find support for our theorized hypotheses across two field studies using Chinese samples (N =294) and Bangladeshi samples (N =243 with multi-wave and multisource designs). The theoretical and practical implications of these findings in organizations, their plausible limitations, and future directions are addressed.

J	Rybár, M; Daly, I				Rybar, Milan; Daly, Ian			Neural decoding of semantic concepts: a systematic literature review	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						semantic decoding; conceptual decoding; literature review; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS); electroencephalography (EEG); intracranial electrodes	PREDICTING BRAIN ACTIVATION; REPRESENTATIONAL CONTENT; COMPUTER INTERFACES; PATTERN-INFORMATION; OBJECT CATEGORIES; FIELD POTENTIALS; SPATIAL FILTERS; NATURAL IMAGES; FMRI; MEMORY	Objective. Semantic concepts are coherent entities within our minds. They underpin our thought processes and are a part of the basis for our understanding of the world. Modern neuroscience research is increasingly exploring how individual semantic concepts are encoded within our brains and a number of studies are beginning to reveal key patterns of neural activity that underpin specific concepts. Building upon this basic understanding of the process of semantic neural encoding, neural engineers are beginning to explore tools and methods for semantic decoding: identifying which semantic concepts an individual is focused on at a given moment in time from recordings of their neural activity. In this paper we review the current literature on semantic neural decoding. Approach. We conducted this review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Specifically, we assess the eligibility of published peer-reviewed reports via a search of PubMed and Google Scholar. We identify a total of 74 studies in which semantic neural decoding is used to attempt to identify individual semantic concepts from neural activity. Main results. Our review reveals how modern neuroscientific tools have been developed to allow decoding of individual concepts from a range of neuroimaging modalities. We discuss specific neuroimaging methods, experimental designs, and machine learning pipelines that are employed to aid the decoding of semantic concepts. We quantify the efficacy of semantic decoders by measuring information transfer rates. We also discuss current challenges presented by this research area and present some possible solutions. Finally, we discuss some possible emerging and speculative future directions for this research area. Significance. Semantic decoding is a rapidly growing area of research. However, despite its increasingly widespread popularity and use in neuroscientific research this is the first literature review focusing on this topic across neuroimaging modalities and with a focus on quantifying the efficacy of semantic decoders.

Otherwise, risk of opportunistic policy-making will impair investments into low-carbon technologies. However, the future benefits and costs of decarbonization are subject to substantial uncertainties. Thus, there may also be societal gains from allowing policy-makers the discretion to adjust the policies as new information becomes available. We examine how this trade-off between policy commitment-either unconditional or state-contingent-and discretion affects the optimal intertemporal design of market-based instruments in the power sector. Using a dynamic partial equilibrium model, we show that commitment to a state-contingent level of ambition for the market-based instrument leads to higher welfare than both unconditional commitment and discretion. With benefit uncertainty, the choice between the practically more feasible approaches of unconditional commitment and discretion is analytically ambiguous. A basic numerical illustration suggests that policy discretion may outperform unconditional commitment in terms of welfare. However, this result is reversed when only a limited fraction of benefit uncertainty resolves in reasonable time, when future policy-makers have own agendas, or when investors are risk-averse. With cost uncertainty, policy discretion is welfare-superior if the government can commit to a technology deployment target.

Traditional instruction therefore could no longer cope with such rapidly changing educational environments that the instructional design and methods need to be largely updated in order to keep up with the demand of multiple entries. A teacher should thoroughly utilize computers and the Internet resources in the instruction for enhancing the teaching effect. Students in Shanghai Open University are sampled for the questionnaire survey in this study. Total 500 copies of questionnaires are distributed. Having deducted invalid and incomplete ones, 344 copies are valid, with effective retrieval rate 69%. The results are summarized as below. 1. Mobile learning perception presents significantly positive correlations with study habits. 2. Study habits reveal remarkably positive correlations with continuous learning. 3. Mobile learning perception shows notably positive correlations with continuous learning. 4. Study habits appear mediation effects on the correlation between mobile learning perception and continuous learning. According to above results, suggestions are proposed in this study for the service or establishment of education contents, expecting to further help learners acquire knowledge.

LINK Up Illinois is a farmers' market incentive programme that aims to increase F&V consumption among Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients by improving access to and affordability of locally grown foods. The present research aimed to identify barriers to F&V consumption that exist among users of the LINK Up Illinois programme. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Farmers' markets in Chicago, Springfield, Northbrook, Woodstock, Aurora and Urbana, IL. Subjects: In 2016, a volunteer sample of 140 LINK Up Illinois users (mean age 42.5 years; 81.7 % female; 28.7 % African American; 44.0 % obese) completed a survey at participating farmers' markets across the state. Information on demographics, food shopping behaviours, programme satisfaction, barriers to F&V consumption and frequency of F&V consumption was collected and examined. Results: Approximately 23 % of survey participants reported consuming F&V >= 3 times/d. The barriers to F&V consumption most often reported by survey participants were the cost of F&V (29.5 %), spoilage (18.6 %), knowing how to cook F&V (8.7 %) and not thinking about F&V when hungry (8.6 %). Results from multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models suggested that reporting one or more barriers was associated with reduced odds of consuming vegetables >= 3 times/d, but not fruits. Conclusions: Cost, spoilage and knowledge of cooking are key barriers to F&V consumption that exist among LINK Up Illinois users. Strategies are needed to mitigate these barriers and increase F&V consumption in this population.

Impact of "early intervention" parent workshops on outcomes for caregivers of children with neurodisabilities: a mixed-methods study	DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Early intervention; neurodevelopmental disability; parent empowerment; consumer engaged research; family-centred service	HEALTH; FAMILY; DISABILITY; CARE	PurposeThis study explored the feasibility, impact and parent experiences of ENVISAGE (ENabling VISions And Growing Expectations)-Families, a parent-researcher co-designed and co-led program for parents/caregivers raising children with early-onset neurodisabilities.MethodsParents/caregivers of a child with a neurodisability aged <= 6 years, recruited in Australia and Canada, participated in five weekly online workshops with other parents. Self-report measures were collected at baseline, immediately after, and 3 months post-ENVISAGE-Families; interviews were done following program completion. Quantitative data were analyzed with generalized estimating equations and qualitative data using interpretive description methodology.ResultsSixty-five parents (86% mothers) were recruited and 60 (92%) completed the program. Strong evidence was found of effects on family empowerment and parent confidence (all p <= 0.05 after the program and maintained at 3-month follow-up). The ENVISAGE-Families program was relevant to parents' needs for: information, connection, support, wellbeing, and preparing for the future. Participants experienced opportunities to reflect on and/or validate their perspectives of disability and development, and how these perspectives related to themselves, their children and family, and their service providers.ConclusionsENVISAGE was feasible and acceptable for parent/caregivers.

J	Kendler, KS				Kendler, Kenneth S.			Phenomenology of Schizophrenia and the Representativeness of Modern Diagnostic Criteria	JAMA PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							DSM; SYMPTOMS	IMPORTANCE This article aims to determine the degree to which modern operationalized diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia reflect the main clinical features of the disorder as described historically by diagnostic experts. OBSERVATIONS Amazon.com, the National Library of Medicine, and Forgottenbooks.com were searched for articles written or translated into English from 1900 to 1960. Clinical descriptions of schizophrenia or dementia praecox appearing in 16 textbooks or review articles published between 1899 and 1956 were reviewed and compared with the criteria for schizophrenia from 6 modern US operationalized diagnostic systems. Twenty prominent symptoms and signs were reported by 5 or more authors. A strong association was seen between the frequency with which the symptoms/signs were reported and the likelihood of their presence in modern diagnostic systems. Of these 20 symptoms/signs, 3 (thought disorder, delusions, and hallucinations) were included in all diagnostic systems and were among the 4 most frequently reported. Three symptoms/signs were added then kept in subsequent criteria: emotional blunting, changes in volition, and changes in social life. Three symptoms/signs were added but then dropped: bizarre delusions, passivity symptoms, and mood incongruity. Eleven symptoms/signs were never included in any diagnostic system. Compared with historical authors, modern criteria favored symptoms over signs. Odd movements and postures, noted by 16 of 18 historical authors, were absent from all modern criteria. DSM-5 criteria contain 6 of the 20 historically noted symptoms/signs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although modern operationalized criteria for schizophrenia reflect symptoms and signs commonly reported by historical experts, many clinical features emphasized by these experts are absent from modern criteria. This is not necessarily problematic as diagnostic criteria are meant to index rather than thoroughly describe syndromes. However, the lack of correspondence in schizophrenia between historically important symptoms/signs and current diagnostic systems highlights the limitations of clinical evaluations and research studies that restrict the diagnostic assessments to current diagnostic criteria. We should not confuse our DSM diagnostic criteria with the disorders that they were designed to index.

While a link has been established between ToM abilities and symptoms of thought disorder, much less is known about other aspects of speech production in SZ. Study design: This is a case-control study in which 25 stable outpatients with recent-onset SZ (27.1 years, 22 men) and 22 matched healthy controls (25.6 years, 16 men) performed a collaborative, verbal production task with a real interaction partner. Blind raters scored how easy participants made it to understand them (Facility ratings), how interesting they were to listen to (Interest ratings) and how expressive they were (Expressivity ratings). ToM was assessed with the Combined Stories Test and Sarfati's cartoon task. Symptoms were assessed with the PANSS five-factor version. Study results: Compared to healthy controls, SZ received significantly lower ratings for all three aspects of their verbal productions (Facility, Interest and Expressivity), despite the raters being blind to group membership. Interestingly, the Facility ratings were linked to ToM performance in the SZ group, which suggest that SZ participants who have difficulties understanding others (ToM deficits) also make it harder for others to understand them. Other notable findings include a strong link between the Expressivity ratings and the Interest ratings for both groups, and significant correlations between the Facility ratings and Cognitive/Disorganisation symptoms, and between the Expressivity ratings and both Negative and Depression/Anxiety symptoms in SZ. Conclusion: Studying speech production during real, collaborative social interactions could help move beyond the individual approach to SZ deficits, making it possible to involve the interaction partners to promote more efficient communication for people with schizophrenia.

Computational methods contribute to discovering the potential disease-related circRNAs. Based on the analysis of the location information expression of biological sequences, the model of iCDA-CGR is proposed to predict the circRNA-disease associations by integrates multi-source information, including circRNA sequence information, gene-circRNA associations information, circRNA-disease associations information and the disease semantic information. In particular, the location information of circRNA sequences was first introduced into the circRNA-disease associations prediction model. The promising results on cross-validation and independent data sets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model. We further implemented case studies, and 19 of the top 30 predicted scores of the proposed model were confirmed by recent experimental reports. The results show that iCDA-CGR model can effectively predict the potential circRNA-disease associations and provide highly reliable candidates for biological experiments, thus helping to further understand the complex disease mechanism. Found in recent research, tumor cell invasion, proliferation, or other biological processes are controlled by circular RNA. Understanding the association between circRNAs and diseases is an important way to explore the pathogenesis of complex diseases and promote disease-targeted therapy. Most methods, such as k-mer and PSSM, based on the analysis of high-throughput expression data have the tendency to think functionally similar nucleic acid lack direct linear homology regardless of positional information and only quantify nonlinear sequence relationships. However, in many complex diseases, the sequence nonlinear relationship between the pathogenic nucleic acid and ordinary nucleic acid is not much different. Therefore, the analysis of positional information expression can help to predict the complex associations between circRNA and disease. To fill up this gap, we propose a new method, named iCDA-CGR, to predict the circRNA-disease associations. In particular, we introduce circRNA sequence information and quantifies the sequence nonlinear relationship of circRNA by Chaos Game Representation (CGR) technology based on the biological sequence position information for the first time in the circRNA-disease prediction model. In the cross-validation experiment, our method achieved 0.8533 AUC, which was significantly higher than other existing methods. In the validation of independent data sets including circ2Disease, circRNADisease and CRDD, the prediction accuracy of iCDA-CGR reached 95.18%, 90.64% and 95.89%. Moreover, in the case studies, 19 of the top 30 circRNA-disease associations predicted by iCDA-CGR on circRDisease dataset were confirmed by newly published literature. These results demonstrated that iCDA-CGR has outstanding robustness and stability, and can provide highly credible candidates for biological experiments.

Here, we describe a regenerative electrode design in which a polymer-based thin-film electrode array is integrated within a thin-film sheet of aligned nanofibers, such that axons regenerating from a transected peripheral nerve are topographically guided across the electrode recording sites. Cultures of dorsal root ganglia were used to explore design parameters leading to cellular migration and neurite extension across the nanofiber/electrode array boundary. Regenerative scaffold electrodes (RSEs) were subsequently fabricated and implanted across rat tibial nerve gaps to evaluate device recording capabilities and influence on nerve regeneration. In 20 of these animals, regeneration was compared between a conventional nerve gap model and an amputation model. Characteristic shaping of regenerated nerve morphology around the embedded electrode array was observed in both groups, and regenerated axon profile counts were similar at the eight week end point. Implanted RSEs recorded evoked neural activity in all of these cases, and also in separate implantations lasting up to five months. These results demonstrate that nanofiber-based topographic cues within a regenerative electrode can influence nerve regeneration, to the potential benefit of a peripheral nerve interface suitable for limb amputees.

Innovation propensity shows substantial variation across avian taxa and provides an adaptive mechanism by which behaviour is flexibly adjusted to changing environmental conditions. Here, we tested for the first time the prediction that inter-individual variation in innovation propensity is equally a measure of behavioural flexibility. We used Indian mynas, Sturnus tristis, a highly successful worldwide invader. Results revealed that mynas that solved an extractive foraging task more quickly learnt to discriminate between a cue that predicted food, and one that did not more quickly. However, fast innovators were slower to change their behaviour when the significance of the food cues changed. This unexpected finding appears at odds with the well-established view that avian taxa with larger brains relative to their body size, and therefore greater neural processing power, are both faster, and more flexible learners. We speculate that the existence of this relationship across taxa can be reconciled with its absence within species by assuming that fast, innovative learners and non innovative, slow, flexible learners constitute two separate individual strategies, which are both underpinned by enhanced neural processing power. This idea is consistent with the recent proposal that individuals may differ consistently in 'cognitive style', differentially trading off speed against accuracy in cognitive tasks.

J	Wong, ZSY; Rigby, M				Wong, Zoie Shui-Yee; Rigby, Michael			Identifying and addressing digital health risks associated with emergency pandemic response: Problem identification, scoping review, and directions toward evidence-based evaluation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Digital health; COVID-19; Health IT ecosystem; Emergency response; Risk; Evidence-based health informatics	INFORMATICS; COVID-19; TECHNOLOGIES	Background and objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital health applications in multifaceted disease management dimensions. This study aims (1) to identify risk issues relating to the rapid development and redeployment of COVID-19 related e-health systems, in primary care, and in the health ecosystems interacting with it and (2) to suggest evidence-based evaluation directions under emergency response. Method: After initial brainstorming of digital health risks posed in this pandemic, a scoping review method was adopted to collect evidence across databases of PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE. Peer-review publications, reports, news sources, and websites that credibly identified the challenges relating digital health scaled for COVID19 were scrutinized. Additional supporting materials were obtained through snowball sampling and the authors' global digital health networks. Studies satisfying the selection criteria were charted based on their study design, primary care focus, and coverage of e-health areas of risk. Results: Fifty-eight studies were mapped for qualitative synthesis. Five identified digital health risk areas associated with the pandemic were governance, system design and coordination, information access, service provision, and user (professional and public) reception. We observed that rapid digital health responses may embed challenges in health system thinking, the long-term development of digital health ecosystems, and interoperability of health IT infrastructure, with concomitant weaknesses in existing evaluation theories. Conclusion: Through identifying digital health risks posed during the pandemic, this paper discussed potential directions for next-generation informatics evaluation development, to better prepare for the post-COVID-19 era, a new future epidemic, or other unforeseen global health emergencies. An updated evidence-based approach to health informatics is essential to gain public confidence in digital health across primary and other health sectors.

J	Tsai, TC; Harasym, PH				Tsai, Tsuen-Chiuan; Harasym, Peter H.			A medical ethical reasoning model and its contributions to medical education	MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article								Objectives Ethical reasoning in medicine is not well understood and medical educators often find it difficult to justify what and how they teach and assess in medical ethics. To facilitate the development of moral values and professional conduct, a model of ethical reasoning was created. The purposes of this paper are to describe the ethical reasoning model and to indicate how it can be used to foster moral and ethical behaviours. Methods The ethical reasoning model was created from information derived from two sources: (i) an examination of different ethical models described in the literature, and (ii) think-aloud interviews with ethical experts in Taiwan and Canada. All the components and cognitive steps used by experts in ethical decision making were extracted and categorised. Interview subjects consisted of 16 voluntary ethics experts. The ethical reasoning models reported in the literature were divided into two groups according to whether they were justification-based or task-based models. Neither of the two types represented the 'whole picture' of ethical reasoning in medicine. This analysis enabled us to identify five universal cognitive steps and the gaps between 'logical decision' and 'action'. Results The think-aloud interviews verified the multi-dimensional components or steps used by experts when resolving ethical problems. The resulting model, designated the Medical Ethical Reasoning (MER) Model, reflects interactions within three domains: medical and ethical knowledge; cognitive reasoning processes, and attitude. Conclusions The MER Model accurately reflects how doctors resolve ethical dilemmas and is seen to be helpful in identifying what and how educators should teach and assess in ethical reasoning. The model can also serve as a communication framework for curricular design. A 'humane' doctor is competent in providing quality, ethical patient care. Making an appropriate ethical decision is the foundation for subsequent ethical behaviours. By contrast with the abundant evidence cited in previous research describing how doctors solve medical problems, there is little empirical evidence indicating how doctors make appropriate ethical decisions. Thus, the cognition of ethical reasoning in medicine is not well understood. This paper represents a step towards overcoming this problem.

The main objective of this work is to identify the prevalence of colostrum avoidance and study its associated factors among mothers of children aged less than 2 years old in the Oromia region of Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study on the practice of colostrum avoidance/prelacteal feeding was conducted in a rural community with 114 mothers of children under 2 years old. Our results reflected that colostrum avoidance and prelacteal feeding were practiced by 56.1% of mothers. The percentage of women who started breastfeeding in the first hour after birth, as recommended by the WHO, was 2.6%. Of the women who practiced colostrum avoidance, 67.2% gave birth at home, and 65.6% were attended by relatives. The likelihood of avoiding colostrum increases in mothers who have a lower educational level, who did not receive health care at the time of delivery, who think that colostrum is dirty and dangerous and who did not receive information about breastfeeding from healthcare professionals. The knowledge emanating from this work may be useful in designing new breastfeeding education programs and/or interventions in Ethiopia and other developing countries.	[Simon, M.

However, the nature of the visual information from the speaker's facial movements that is relevant for this enhancement is still unclear. Like auditory speech signals, visual speech signals unfold over time and contain both dynamic configural information and luminance-defined local motion cues; two information sources that are thought to engage anatomically and functionally separate visual systems. Whereas, some past studies have highlighted the importance of local, luminance-defined motion cues in audiovisual speech perception, the contribution of dynamic configural information signalling changes in form over time has not yet been assessed. We therefore attempted to single out the contribution of dynamic configural information to audiovisual speech processing. To this aim, we measured word identification performance in noise using unimodal auditory stimuli, and with audiovisual stimuli. In the audiovisual condition, speaking faces were presented as point light displays achieved via motion capture of the original talker. Point light displays could be isoluminant, to minimise the contribution of effective luminance-defined local motion information, or with added luminance contrast, allowing the combined effect of dynamic configural cues and local motion cues. Audiovisual enhancement was found in both the isoluminant and contrast-based luminance conditions compared to an auditory-only condition, demonstrating, for the first time the specific contribution of dynamic configural cues to audiovisual speech improvement. These findings imply that globally processed changes in a speaker's facial shape contribute significantly towards the perception of articulatory gestures and the analysis of audiovisual speech.

J	Clark, C; Kalita, J				Clark, Connor; Kalita, Jugal			A multiobjective memetic algorithm for PPI network alignment	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							PROTEIN-INTERACTION NETWORKS; GLOBAL ALIGNMENT; DATABASE; SIMILARITY; TOOL	Motivation: There recently has been great interest in aligning protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to identify potentially orthologous proteins between species. It is thought that the topological information contained in these networks will yield better orthology predictions than sequence similarity alone. Recent work has found that existing aligners have difficulty making use of both topological and sequence similarity when aligning, with either one or the other being better matched. This can be at least partially attributed to the fact that existing aligners try to combine these two potentially conflicting objectives into a single objective. Results: We present Optnetalign, a multiobjective memetic algorithm for the problem of PPI network alignment that uses extremely efficient swap-based local search, mutation and crossover operations to create a population of alignments. This algorithm optimizes the conflicting goals of topological and sequence similarity using the concept of Pareto dominance, exploring the tradeoff between the two objectives as it runs. This allows us to produce many high-quality candidate alignments in a single run. Our algorithm produces alignments that are much better compromises between topological and biological match quality than previous work, while better characterizing the diversity of possible good alignments between two networks. Our aligner's results have several interesting implications for future research on alignment evaluation, the design of network alignment objectives and the interpretation of alignment results.

Design Systematic review. Data sources PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science were searched through 15 February 2022. Eligibility criteria Any article that included a clinical checklist aimed at improving the diagnostic process. Checklists were defined as any structured guide intended to elicit additional thinking regarding diagnosis. Data extraction and synthesis Two authors independently reviewed and selected articles based on eligibility criteria. Each extracted unique checklist was independently characterised according to the well-established human factors framework: Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety 2.0 (SEIPS 2.0). If reported, checklist efficacy in reducing diagnostic error (eg, diagnostic accuracy, number of errors or any patient-related outcomes) was outlined. Risk of study bias was independently evaluated using standardised quality assessment tools in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Results A total of 30 articles containing 25 unique checklists were included. Checklists were characterised within the SEIPS 2.0 framework as follows: Work Systems subcomponents of Tasks (n=13), Persons (n=2) and Internal Environment (n=3); Processes subcomponents of Cognitive (n=20) and Social and Behavioural (n=2); and Outcomes subcomponents of Professional (n=2). Other subcomponents, such as External Environment or Patient outcomes, were not addressed. Fourteen checklists examined effect on diagnostic outcomes: seven demonstrated improvement, six were without improvement and one demonstrated mixed results. Importantly, Tasks-oriented studies more often demonstrated error reduction (n=5/7) than those addressing the Cognitive process (n=4/10). Conclusions Most diagnostic checklists incorporated few human factors components. Checklists addressing the SEIPS 2.0 Tasks subcomponent were more often associated with a reduction in diagnostic errors. Studies examining less explored subcomponents and emphasis on Tasks, rather than the Cognitive subcomponents, may be warranted to prevent diagnostic errors.

Snakes are of conservation concern throughout North America, but effective management and conservation are hindered by a lack of basic natural history information and the small number of large-scale studies designed to assess general population trends. To address this information gap, we compiled detection/nondetection data for 13 large terrestrial species from 449 traps located across the southeastern United States, and we characterized the land cover surrounding each trap at multiple spatial scales (250-, 500-, and 1000-m buffers). We used occupancy modeling, while accounting for heterogeneity in detection probability, to identify habitat variables that were influential in determining the presence of a particular species. We evaluated 12 competing models for each species, representing various hypotheses pertaining to important habitat features for terrestrial snakes. Overall, considerable interspecific variation existed in important habitat variables and relevant spatial scales. For example, kingsnakes (Lampropeltis getula) were negatively associated with evergreen forests, whereas Louisiana pinesnake (Pituophis ruthveni) occupancy increased with increasing coverage of this forest type. Some species were positively associated with grassland and scrub/shrub (e.g., Slowinski's cornsnake, Elaphe slowinskii) whereas others, (e. g., copperhead, Agkistrodon contortrix, and eastern diamond-backed rattlesnake, Crotalus adamanteus) were positively associated with forested habitats. Although the species that we studied may persist in varied landscapes other than those we identified as important, our data were collected in relatively undeveloped areas. Thus, our findings may be relevant when generating conservation plans or restoration goals. Maintaining or restoring landscapes that are most consistent with the ancestral habitat preferences of terrestrial snake assemblages will require a diverse habitat matrix over large spatial scales.

A focus group study	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Stroke; Upper limb; Assistive technology; Self-management; Patient; Family caregivers; Health care professional; Rehabilitation; Qualitative research	UPPER EXTREMITY FUNCTION; STIMULATION; THERAPY; TIME; COST; CARE	Background: Assistive Technologies, defined as "electrical or mechanical devices designed to help people recover movement" have demonstrated clinical benefits in upper-limb stroke rehabilitation. Stroke services are becoming community-based and more reliant on self-management approaches. Assistive technologies could become important tools within self-management, however, in practice, few people currently use assistive technologies. This study investigated patients', family caregivers and health professionals' experiences and perceptions of stroke upper-limb rehabilitation and assistive technology use and identified the barriers and facilitators to their use in supporting stroke self-management. Methods: A three-day exhibition of assistive technologies was attended by 204 patients, family caregivers/friends and health professionals. Four focus groups were conducted with people purposively sampled from exhibition attendees. They included i) people with stroke who had used assistive technologies (n = 5), ii) people with stroke who had not used assistive technologies (n = 6), iii) family caregivers (n = 5) and iv) health professionals (n = 6). The audio-taped focus groups were facilitated by a moderator and observer. All participants were asked to discuss experiences, strengths, weaknesses, barriers and facilitators to using assistive technologies. Following transcription, data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: All respondents thought assistive technologies had the potential to support self-management but that this opportunity was currently unrealised. All respondents considered assistive technologies could provide a home-based solution to the need for high intensity upper-limb rehabilitation. All stakeholders also reported significant barriers to assistive technology use, related to i) device design ii) access to assistive technology information and iii) access to assistive technology provision. The lack of and need for a coordinated system for assistive technology provision was apparent. A circular limitation of lack of evidence in clinical settings, lack of funded provision, lack of health professional knowledge about assistive technologies and confidence in prescribing them leading to lack of assistive technology service provision meant that often patients either received no assistive technologies or they and/or their family caregivers liaised directly with manufacturers without any independent expert advice. Conclusions: Considerable systemic barriers to realising the potential of assistive technologies in upper-limb stroke rehabilitation were reported. Attention needs to be paid to increasing evidence of assistive technology effectiveness and develop clinical service provision. Device manufacturers, researchers, health professionals, service funders and people with stroke and family caregivers need to work creatively and collaboratively to develop new funding models, improve device design and increase knowledge and training in assistive technology use.

In this paper, we conduct an in-depth review of HMI in ICVs. Firstly, research and application development status are pointed out through the discussion on the cutting-edge technology classification, achievements, and challenges of the HMI technologies in ICVs, including recognition technology, multi-dimensional human vehicle interface, and emerging in-vehicle intelligent units. Then, the human factors issues of ICVs are discussed from three aspects: ICV acceptance, interaction quality of ICVs, and user experience of ICVs. Besides, based on the interaction technology and the mapping of the above issues, we conducted a visual analysis of the literature to realize the reflective thinking of the current HMI in ICVs. Finally, the challenges of HMI technology in ICVs are summarized. Moreover, the promising future opportunities are proposed from three aspects: utility optimization, experience reconfiguration, and value acquisition, to gaining insight into advanced and pleasant HMI in ICVs.

Circularity and life cycle environmental impact assessment of batteries for electric vehicles: Industrial challenges, best practices and research guidelines	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Article						Circular economy; Electric mobility; Life cycle thinking; Li -ion battery; Literature screening; Sustainable mobility	LITHIUM-ION BATTERY; PLUG-IN HYBRID; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; DESIGN; ECONOMY; TECHNOLOGY; ISSUES; ANODE	Circular economy (CE) strategies, aimed at reducing resource consumption and waste generation, can help mitigate the environmental impacts of battery electric vehicles (BEV), thereby providing a more efficient alternative to petrol-fuelled vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries (LIB) are commonly used in BEV because of their higher performance than that of the benchmarks. However, how to analyse the CE innovations through life-cycle assessment (LCA) and how environmental savings relate to different CE strategies remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to i) identify and characterise the CE strategies most studied thus far in LCA studies on electric vehicle batteries, ii) evaluate the reasons behind the variability in the environmental impacts and savings between LIB with different chemistries, and iii) provide guidelines for the development of robust LCA studies for LIB by integrating CE management scenarios. The results showed that LCA-supported CE strategies have not been sufficiently explored in the literature, causing variability in methodological choices and research outcomes. While battery recycling was a dominant topic contemplated in 80% of the analysed LCA studies, other CE strategies, such as battery upgrading or remanufacturing, received little attention. The normalised impacts for LIB varied from 4400 kg CO2 eq. to 55,000 kg CO2 eq. based on several factors subject to the practitioners' choices, such as the battery chemistry considered, impact assessment method applied, available inventories used, and the CE scenario analysed. LCA methodological guidelines for determining the environmental sustainability of the CE strategies for electric vehicle batteries were provided based on the findings.

The purpose of this study is to assess patients' impressions and satisfaction with 308-nm laser treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis. Study Design/Materials and Methods: Telephone survey data were obtained from patients after participation in a case series study of 124 patients with mild to moderate psoriasis treated with 308-nm UVB laser treatment for a target plaque and other lesions. The survey included information on changes in the target plaque, remission time, changes in other areas of psoriasis, satisfaction with the result, side effects of treatment, and efficacy relative to other treatments. Results: Patients (55% of total) reported overall satisfaction with the treatments, and 63% of patients thought they needed additional laser treatments, including for maintenance. Subjects (25170 reported that the laser treatments were better than any other treatment they had tried, Adverse effects were mild and had either disappeared or were significantly decreased in 86% of patients. Self reported length of remission compared favorably to those for other therapies for localized disease. Conclusions: UVB laser treatments provide a well-tolerated means to clear psoriasis plaques. The treatment provides a high level of patient satisfaction.

Much can be done, however, to further improve the experience of wearing a head mounted display, in order to forget being at home while playing a computer game or navigating a virtual environment. In fact, with the widespread availability, in the near future, of head mounted displays (such as oculus rift) not only the power of gaming platforms will increase, but also the support to the construction of graphical user interfaces, which more closely resemble reality. Hence, although it may be exciting to navigate a virtual space wearing a head mounted display, user presence still depends on the functional fidelity of virtual objects. Simply said, presence perception is highly influenced by the opportunity of interacting realistically with the environment at hand. Hence, many graphical user interface (GUI) components should be re-engineered adopting a diegetic approach, as simple adaptations may result unnatural, awkward or out of place. Such fact, urges, for example, re-thinking how users receive and interact with information in virtual worlds. Along this direction of work, this contribution moves a step forward analyzing the role of diegetic interfaces. In particular, it describes the design, the implementation and the performance, to the eyes of its users, of three different diegetic interfaces, tested utilizing the oculus rift display. The results that are here presented, although referring to three specific cases, are of wider scope as they have been obtained for two GUI components that are adopted throughout many different entertainment virtual environments, namely a shell and a global control interface.

Qualitative exploration of diagnosis and management from the perspective of people with PFP is lacking. Objectives: To inform care and improve intervention delivery by exploring the experience of people with PFP regarding diagnosis and management. Design: Qualitative study with semi-structured interviews. Method: Online recruiting yielded a convenience sample of participants with PFP for semi-structured interview. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using thematic analysis until theoretical saturation by multiple investigators to determine themes and sub-themes. Results: 12 participants were interviewed, with three themes identified; the value of diagnosis, the need for tailored (individualised) care, and the role of education. Participants viewed receiving a diagnosis as essential to guide management, yet one was rarely provided, causing uncertainty about pain mechanisms; "it's nice to be told what it is that's wrong". Interventions needed to be tailored to the individual as not all participants responded in the same way to treatment(s) or had the same needs; "everyone copes and reacts differently". Finally, participants viewed education as essential to empower them to understand and manage the condition; "if I'd have been given more information, I think I'd know how to deal with it more". Conclusions: The overarching narrative from three themes was a desire for clearly communicated personalised care that meets individual needs. People with PFP desire a diagnosis to explain their pain, tailored interventions, and appropriate education to optimise their experience and outcomes.

Aim: To explore clinician views on decisional conflict in patients with end-stage kidney disease. Design: Interpretive, qualitative study. Setting and participants: As part of the wider National Institute for Health Research, PAlliative Care in chronic Kidney diSease study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with clinicians (nephrologists n=12; 7 female and clinical nurse specialists n=15; 15 female) across 10 renal centres in the United Kingdom. Interviews took place between April 2015 and October 2016 and a thematic analysis of the interview data was undertaken. Results: Three major themes with associated subthemes were identified. The first, Frequent changing of mind regarding treatment options', revealed how patients frequently altered their treatment decisions, some refusing to make a decision until deterioration occurred. The second theme, Obligatory beneficence', included clinicians helping patients to make informed decisions where outcomes were uncertain. In weighing up risks and benefits, and the impact on patients, clinicians sometimes withheld information they thought might cause concern. Finally, Intricacy of the decision' uncovered clinicians' views on the momentous and brave decision to be made. They also acknowledged the risks associated with this complex decision in giving prognostic information which might be inaccurate. Limitations: Relies on interpretative description which uncovers constructed truths and does not include interviews with patients. Conclusion: Findings identify decisional conflict in patient decision-making and a tension between the prerequisite for shared decision-making and current clinical practice. Clinicians also face conflict when discussing treatment options due to uncertainty in equipoise between treatments and how much information should be shared. The findings are likely to resonate across countries outside the United Kingdom.

We expect the expression patterns produced by the collection of 5,000 lines that we are currently generating to encompass all neurons in the brain in a variety of intersecting patterns. Overlapping 3-kb DNA fragments from the flanking noncoding and intronic regions of genes thought to have patterned expression in the adult brain were inserted into a defined genomic location by site-specific recombination. These fragments were then assayed for their ability to function as transcriptional enhancers in conjunction with a synthetic core promoter designed to work with a wide variety of enhancer types. An analysis of 44 fragments from four genes found that > 80% drive expression patterns in the brain; the observed patterns were, on average, comprised of < 100 cells. Our results suggest that the D. melanogaster genome contains > 50,000 enhancers and that multiple enhancers drive distinct subsets of expression of a gene in each tissue and developmental stage. We expect that these lines will be valuable tools for neuroanatomy as well as for the elucidation of neuronal circuits and information flow in the fly brain.

Influential theories of cerebellar information processing have largely assumed random network connectivity, which increases the encoding capacity ofthe network's first layer(8-)(13). However, maximizing encoding capacity reduces the resilience to noise(7). To understand how neuronal circuits address this fundamental trade-off, we mapped the feedforward connectivity in the mouse cerebellar cortex using automated large-scale transmission electron microscopy and convolutional neural network-based image segmentation. We found that both the input and output layers ofthe circuit exhibit redundant and selective connectivity motifs, which contrast with prevailing models. Numerical simulations suggest that these redundant, non-random connectivity motifs increase the resilience to noise at a negligible cost to the overall encoding capacity. This work reveals how neuronal network structure can support a trade-off between encoding capacity and redundancy, unveiling principles of biological network architecture with implications for the design of artificial neural networks.

Assessing the Benefit-Risk Profile for Pediatric Implantable Auditory Prostheses	THERAPEUTIC INNOVATION & REGULATORY SCIENCE			English	Article						auditory brainstem implant; cochlear implant; cochleovestibular abnormality; pediatric; deaf	BRAIN-STEM IMPLANT; SENSORINEURAL HEARING-LOSS; COCHLEAR NERVE DEFICIENCY; INNER-EAR MALFORMATIONS; SPOKEN LANGUAGE-DEVELOPMENT; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE-2; BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES; DECISION-MAKING; YOUNG-CHILDREN	Background/Aims: Children with congenital cochleovestibular abnormalities associated with profound hearing loss have few treatment options if cochlear implantation does not yield benefit. An alternative is the auditory brainstem implant (ABI). Regulatory authority device approvals currently include a structured benefit-risk assessment. Such an assessment, for regulatory purposes or to guide clinical decision making, has not been published, to our knowledge, for the ABI and may lead to the design of a research program that incorporates regulatory authority, family, and professional input. Methods: Much structured benefit-risk research has been conducted in the context of drug trials; here we apply this approach to device studies. A qualitative framework organized benefit (speech recognition, parent self-report measures) and risk (surgery- and device-related) information to guide the selection of candidates thought to have potential benefit from ABI. Results: Children with cochleovestibular anatomical abnormalities are challenging for appropriate assessment of candidacy for a cochlear implant or an ABI. While the research is still preliminary, children with an ABI appear to slowly obtain benefit over time. A team of professionals, including audiological, occupational, and educational therapy, affords maximum opportunity for benefit. Conclusions: Pediatric patients who have abnormal anatomy and are candidates for an implantable auditory prosthetic require an individualized, multisystems review. The qualitative benefit-risk assessment used here to characterize the condition, the medical need, potential benefits, risks, and risk management strategies has revealed the complex factors involved. After implantation, continued team support for the family during extensive postimplant therapy is needed to develop maximum auditory skill benefit.

The Contribution of Medial Prefrontal Cortical Regions to Conditioned Inhibition	BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						prelimbic; infralimbic; associative learning	REACTION-TIME-TASK; FEATURE-NEGATIVE DISCRIMINATION; FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; PRELIMBIC-INFRALIMBIC AREAS; BEHAVIORAL FLEXIBILITY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; DORSOMEDIAL STRIATUM; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; FEAR EXTINCTION	Few studies have considered the process by which individuals learn to omit a response, which is an essential aspect of adaptive behavior. Several lines of evidence indicate that two regions of the medial prefrontal cortex have disparate roles in behavioral flexibility. In particular, the prelimbic cortex (PL) is thought to facilitate the generation of a strategy to inhibit a prepotent response, whereas the infralimbic cortex (IL) appears to be more important for maintaining extensively trained inhibitory behaviors. The present experiments were designed to elucidate the contributions of PL and IL to the acquisition and maintenance of Pavlovian conditioned inhibition. In Experiment 1, damage to PL before training in a compound feature negative discrimination task impaired inhibitory learning. By comparison, lesions of IL had little effect. In Experiment 2, lesions of PL or IL occurred after overtraining, and damage to IL significantly impaired subsequent performance in the task, suggesting that this region is involved in the continued expression of Pavlovian conditioned inhibition after thorough training. PL may also be involved in maintaining inhibition, as evidenced by a marginally significant lesion-induced performance deficit. These data support the notion that PL and IL have distinguishable roles in modulating inhibition, while contributing important information about the specific role for PL in acquisition of an inhibitory response and IL in performance.

J	Karim, NI; Maries, A; Singh, C				Karim, Nafis I.; Maries, Alexandru; Singh, Chandralekha			Exploring one aspect of pedagogical content knowledge of teaching assistants using the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism	PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH			English	Article							PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES; GRADUATE-STUDENTS; GRADING PRACTICES; TEACHERS; PHYSICS; REFLECTION; SCIENCE; IMPACT; PEERS	The Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) has been used to assess student understanding of introductory concepts of electricity and magnetism because many of the items on the CSEM have strong distractor choices which correspond to students' alternate conceptions. Instruction is unlikely to be effective if instructors do not know the common alternate conceptions of introductory physics students and explicitly take into account common student difficulties in their instructional design. Here, we discuss research involving the CSEM to evaluate one aspect of the pedagogical content knowledge of teaching assistants (TAs): knowledge of introductory students' alternate conceptions in electricity and magnetism as revealed by the CSEM. For each item on the CSEM, the TAs were asked to identify the most common incorrect answer choice selected by introductory physics students if they did not know the correct answer after traditional instruction. Then, we used introductory student CSEM post-test data to assess the extent to which TAs were able to identify the most common alternate conception of introductory students in each question on the CSEM. We find that the TAs were thoughtful when attempting to identify common student difficulties and they enjoyed learning about student difficulties this way. However, they struggled to identify many common difficulties of introductory students that persist after traditional instruction. We discuss specific alternate conceptions that persist after traditional instruction, the extent to which TAs were able to identify them, and results from think-aloud interviews with TAs which provided valuable information regarding why the TAs sometimes selected certain alternate conceptions as the most common but were instead very rare among introductory students. We also discuss how tasks such as the one used in this study can be used in professional development programs to engender productive discussions about the importance of being knowledgeable about student alternate conceptions in order to help students learn. Interviews with TAs engaged in this task as well as our experience with such tasks in our professional development programs suggest that they are beneficial.

We experimentally contrast the processing of morphology (case and aspect), syntax (subordination), and lexical semantics (collocations) in a healthy L1 population of Polish, a language rich in form distinctions. We study the processing of these four types under two conditions: a single task condition in which the grammaticality of stimuli was judged and a concurrent task condition in which grammaticality judgments were combined with a digit span task. Dividing attention impedes access to declarative memory while leaving procedural memory unaffected and hence constitutes a test that dissociates which types of linguistic information each long-term memory construct subserves. Our findings confirm the existence of a distinction between lexicon and grammar as a generative, dual-route model would predict, but the distinction is graded, as usage-based models assume: the hypothesized grammar-lexicon opposition appears as a continuum on which grammatical phenomena can be placed as being more or less "ruly" or "idiosyncratic." However, usage-based models, too, need adjusting as not all types of linguistic knowledge are proceduralized to the same extent. This move away from a simple dichotomy fundamentally changes how we think about memory for language, and hence how we design and interpret behavioral and neuroimaging studies that probe into the nature of language cognition.

J	Chae, SW; Lee, KC				Chae, Seong Wook; Lee, Kun Chang			Exploring the effect of the human brand on consumers' decision quality in online shopping An eye-tracking approach	ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW			English	Article						Human brand; Decision quality; Product type; Eye-tracking; Trust; Consumer behaviour; Republic of Korea	STRATEGIES; CHOICE; PERSPECTIVE; ANTECEDENTS; PRODUCTS; INTERNET; COMMERCE; LOYALTY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how employing human brands affects consumers' decision quality in an online shopping environment by analysing visual attention using an eye-tracking technique. Design/methodology/approach - The experimental design used to examine the effect of human brands in an online shopping environment was a two-factor repeated measure with two levels for each factor. The first factor of the design was a within-factor measure of the product type, and the second was a between-factor measure of the level of perceived decision quality. For this experiment 38 healthy participants were recruited at a university in South Korea. Findings - First employing human brands in an online shop influences consumers' perceived decision quality. Second the results support a significant difference in perceived product trust between the two perceived decision quality levels. Finally the product type influences consumers' perceived trust towards the product. Research limitations/implications - This research has the limitations of a relatively small sample size and the use of a sample of university students, which may not be representative of the general population. Future researchers could utilise experiments to analyse the message area of the screen for detailed product descriptions and include various samples, which could result in additional insights and generalised experimental results. Practical implications - Employing human brands can improve consumers' decision making processes and enhance the quality of their decisions by reducing cognitive effort and appealing to consumers emotionally through heuristic choices. In addition it can increase trust towards products and, furthermore, lead consumers to think positively about the quality of the decisions they make. The paper suggests that companies apply human brands in online shops to improve consumers' decision quality and obtain competitive advantage. Originality/value - One of this paper's contributions is employing a multi-method approach, a self-reported questionnaire and eye-movement data, to gain a deeper understanding of the data when observing a complex phenomenon, as consumers themselves may not be aware of their reactions in such situations.

The study examined the extent to which teachers' knowledge -based reasoning explains their visual focus of attention to whole class and individual students. We found that teachers' descriptions of students' social relations and emotions associated positively with teachers' visual focus of attention to the whole class. Teachers' descriptions of teacher-related information/elab-oration and pedagogy linked negatively with teachers' visual focus of attention to individual students.

Three research areas, human aspects of software engineering, requirements engineering, and information systems, study these topics from various perspectives. We think it is important to analyze user participation and involvement in software engineering comprehensively to encourage further research in this area. We investigate the evidence on effects of user participation and involvement on system success and we explore which methods are available in literature. A systematic mapping study was conducted. The systematic search yielded 3,698 hits, from which we identified 289 unique papers. These papers were reviewed by the first author based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The second author validated the selection of papers by reviewing the reasons for exclusion and inclusion and the corresponding papers on a sample base. 58 of the 289 papers were selected (22 statistical survey and meta-study papers and 36 methods papers). Based on the empirical evidence of the surveys and meta-studies, we developed a meta-analysis of structural equation models. This overview demonstrates that most papers showed positive correlations between aspects of development processes (including user participation) and human aspects (including user involvement) and system success. The analysis of the proposed solutions from the method papers revealed a wide variety of user participation and involvement practices for most activities within software development.

We here assess the impact of commonly employed outgroup sampling schemes and missing morphological data in extant taxa on age estimates in a total-evidence dating analysis under the uniform tree prior. Our study group is Pimpliformes, a highly diverse, rapidly radiating group of parasitoid wasps of the family Ichneumonidae. We analyze a data set comprising 201 extant and 79 fossil taxa, including the oldest fossils of the family from the Early Cretaceous and the first unequivocal representatives of extant subfamilies from themid-Paleogene. Based on newly compiled molecular data fromten nuclear genes and amorphological matrix that includes 222 characters, we showthat age estimates become both older and less precise with the inclusion of more distant and more poorly sampled outgroups. These outgroups not only lack morphological and temporal information but also sit on long terminal branches and considerably increase the evolutionary rate heterogeneity. In addition, we discover an artifact that might be detrimental for total-evidence dating: "bare-branch attraction," namely high attachment probabilities of certain fossils to terminal branches for which morphological data are missing. Using computer simulations, we confirm the generality of this phenomenon and show that a large phylogenetic distance to any of the extant taxa, rather than just older age, increases the risk of a fossil being misplaced due to bare-branch attraction. After restricting outgroup sampling and adding morphological data for the previously attracting, bare branches, we recover a Jurassic origin for Pimpliformes and Ichneumonidae. This first age estimate for the group not only suggests an older origin than previously thought but also that diversification of the crown group happened well before the CretaceousPaleogene boundary. Our case study demonstrates that in order to obtain robust age estimates, total-evidence dating studies need to be based on a thorough and balancedsampling of both extant and fossil taxa, with the aim of minimizing evolutionary rate heterogeneity and missing morphological information.

In two experimental studies using business process models, we demonstrate how eye tracking can contribute to understanding the cognitive processes by which readers use conceptual modeling scripts to perform problem solving tasks. In the first study, we compare scripts generated using two process modeling grammars and demonstrate how attention paid to specific parts of scripts generated using grammar variations, and differences in visual association between parts of a diagram, account for task performance. In the second study, we use a combination of eye tracking and verbal protocol analysis to examine how visual association between parts of conceptual modeling scripts can indicate cognitive integration while performing problem solving tasks. The studies show that task performance can be explained with different mental processes, reflected in specific eye tracking behavior, where scripts developed following different rules invoke different cognitive processes. We show that attention can be measured by eye tracking and can explain task performance. In addition, we show that visual association (which is observable) between parts of a modeling script involves cognitive integration (which is not observable). This finding can be used to improve conceptual modeling grammars in several ways, including understanding the effects of alternative visual arrangements of models on how effectively they communicate domain knowledge for particular tasks, and guiding the design of visual modeling notations.

The AbgT family: A novel class of antimetabolite transporters	PROTEIN SCIENCE			English	Review						AbgT-family transporters; antimetabolite transporters; membrane proteins; X-ray crystallography; Neisseria gonorrhoeae MtrF; Alcanivorax borkumensis YdaH	MTRE EFFLUX PUMP; NEISSERIA-GONORRHOEAE; FOLIC-ACID; ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE; DIHYDROPTEROATE SYNTHETASE; PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; ENZYMATIC-SYNTHESIS; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; BIOSYNTHESIS; PROTEIN	The AbgT family of transporters was thought to contribute to bacterial folate biosynthesis by importing the catabolite p-aminobenzoyl-glutamate for producing this essential vitamin. Approximately 13,000 putative transporters of the family have been identified. However, before our work, no structural information was available and even functional data were minimal for this family of membrane proteins. To elucidate the structure and function of the AbgT family of transporters, we recently determined the X-ray structures of the full-length Alcanivorax borkumensis YdaH and Neisseria gonorrhoeae MtrF membrane proteins. The structures reveal that these two transporters assemble as dimers with architectures distinct from all other families of transporters. Both YdaH and MtrF are bowl-shaped dimers with a solvent-filled basin extending from the cytoplasm halfway across the membrane bilayer. The protomers of YdaH and MtrF contain nine transmembrane helices and two hairpins. These structures directly suggest a plausible pathway for substrate transport. A combination of the crystal structure, genetic analysis and substrate accumulation assay indicates that both YdaH and MtrF behave as exporters, capable of removing the folate metabolite p-aminobenzoic acid from bacterial cells. Further experimental data based on drug susceptibility and radioactive transport assay suggest that both YdaH and MtrF participate as antibiotic efflux pumps, importantly mediating bacterial resistance to sulfonamide antimetabolite drugs. It is possible that many of these AbgT-family transporters act as exporters, thereby conferring bacterial resistance to sulfonamides. The AbgT-family transporters may be important targets for the rational design of novel antibiotics to combat bacterial infections.

Industry funding was associated with increased use of core outcome sets	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Clinical trial registry; Core outcome set; Rheumatoid arthritis; Uptake; World Health Organization international clinical trials registry platform		Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess the uptake of the rheumatoid arthritis core outcome set (RA-COS) using data from multiple data providers, and to investigate factors that may influence this uptake. Study Design and Setting: An observational review was carried out on all clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis that were indexed on the World Health Organization-International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO-ICTRP). Various measures of COS uptake were calculated from information presented in the trial registries and trial publications. Logistic regression was conducted to investigate factors thought to be associated with planned COS uptake. Results: A total of 341 trials were eligible for the evaluation of RA-COS uptake. In the decade leading up to 2019, the assessment of uptake based on published results was maintained at just over 80%. Trials that were not commercially funded were much less likely to plan to measure the RA-COS than those with industry funding (60% vs. 80%; adjusted OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.32; P < 0.001). Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that the use of the WHO-ICTRP can identify a large and geographically diverse range of trials to include in the evaluation of COS uptake.

The Flexible Nature of Unconscious Cognition	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; ERP COMPONENTS; GO/NOGO TASK; STIMULI; CORTEX; WORDS; BRAIN	The cognitive signature of unconscious processes is hotly debated recently. Generally, consciousness is thought to mediate flexible, adaptive and goal-directed behavior, but in the last decade unconscious processing has rapidly gained ground on traditional conscious territory. In this study we demonstrate that the scope and impact of unconscious information on behavior and brain activity can be modulated dynamically on a trial-by-trial basis. Participants performed a Go/No-Go experiment in which an unconscious (masked) stimulus preceding a conscious target could be associated with either a Go or No-Go response. Importantly, the mapping of stimuli onto these actions varied on a trial-by-trial basis, preventing the formation of stable associations and hence the possibility that unconscious stimuli automatically activate these control actions. By eliminating stimulus-response associations established through practice we demonstrate that unconscious information can be processed in a flexible and adaptive manner. In this experiment we show that the same unconscious stimulus can have a substantially different effect on behavior and (prefrontal) brain activity depending on the rapidly changing task context in which it is presented. This work suggests that unconscious information processing shares many sophisticated characteristics (including flexibility and context-specificity) with its conscious counterpart.

However, even if a comprehensive microbial information can be obtained by microbiota profiling, it would not be necessarily sufficient for all circumstances. To prove this, the feasibility of the most widely used V3-V4 amplicon sequencing method for food safety assessment was examined here. We designed a pathogen (Vibrio parahaemolyticus) contamination and/or V. parahaemolyticus-specific phage treatment model of raw oysters under improper storage temperature and monitored their microbial structure changes. The samples stored at refrigerator temperature (negative control, NC) and those that were stored at room temperature without any treatment (no treatment, NT) were included as control groups. The profiling results revealed that no statistical difference exists between the NT group and the pathogen spiked-and/or phage treated groups even when the bacterial composition was compared at the possible lowest-rank taxa, family/ genus level. In the beta-diversity analysis, all the samples except the NC group formed one distinct cluster. Notably, the samples with pathogen and/or phage addition did not form each cluster even though the enumerated number of V. parahaemolyticus in those samples were extremely different. These discrepant results indicate that the feasibility of 16S rRNA short amplicon sequencing should not be overgeneralized in microbiological safety assessment of food samples, such as raw oyster.

This importance has led to the need to advance in the development of environmentally sustainable and safe nanomaterials by incorporat-ing the principles of green chemistry during their synthesis and in their applications. However, this qualitative framework of thought does not offer minimum criteria for the use of the term "green", and therefore, this adjec-tive is commonly used to refer to bio-based or nanotechnological processes without taking into account their net ecological impact. In this context, environmental sustainability metrics can be applied to nanotechnology to com-pare, optimize and quantify the environmental sustainability of synthesis procedures.

A new survey to evaluate conflict of interest policies at academic medical centers	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Background A majority of academic medical centers (AMCs) have now adopted conflict of interest policies (COI) to address relationships with pharmaceutical and device industries that can increase the risk of bias in patient care, education and research. However, AMCs may have little information on the impact of their policies. This paper provides a new method, which is a free, publicly-available survey, to fill this information gap and improve COI programs at AMCs. Methods & findings The survey, piloted in three AMCs and designed in collaboration with national conflicts of interest policy experts, covers a range of universal compliance-related concerns, which allows institutions to tailor questions to align with their own policies and culture. The survey was low-burden, and provided important data for these AMCs to evaluate their policies. A descriptive analysis of the pooled pilot site data (n = 1578) was performed, which found that a majority of respondents did not have financial ties with industry and a majority was satisfied with specific COI policies at their institutions. The analysis also showed that the survey is sensitive to differences that AMCs will find meaningful. For instance, individuals with industry ties were significantly more likely than individuals without ties to think that COI policies unnecessarily hindered interactions with industry (p = .004), were ineffective at reducing harm to patients (p < .001), and were ineffective in reducing bias in medical education (p>.001). Conclusion The survey is now free and publicly available for use by any institution. AMCs can use the results policies.

J	Elfakki, AO; Sghaier, S; Alotaibi, AA				Elfakki, Abir Osman; Sghaier, Souhir; Alotaibi, Abdullah Alhumaidi			An Efficient System Based on Experimental Laboratory in 3D Virtual Environment for Students with Learning Disabilities	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						virtual experiments laboratory; 3D virtual environment; students with learning disabilities; cognitive skills	PEOPLE	Virtual reality applications can enhance the education and training of students with learning disabilities, along with their quality of life. Virtual worlds offer opportunities for creating a highly interactive, complex simulation. Modeling and scripting tools can be applied in these worlds. Providing functionalities for managing presentations, administration as well as assessment of coursework in an educational context, virtual learning environments support teaching and learning in schools. Learning disabilities such as "dyslexia, dyscalculia, attention issues (ADHD), and disability in retrieving information", which students need to do physics experiments, are a major source of concern since they impair a person's ability to learn. Traditional teaching methods do not appear to support the same thought in the situation of students with learning disabilities, who normally need a significant investment of time, money, and people for individual tutoring. Students with this problem have difficulty envisioning or visualizing what they are being taught, in addition to breaking down and processing the material. To address the above issues, this paper develops and evaluates a 3D virtual physics laboratory to improve cognitive skills in physics experiments for students with learning disabilities. The environment is created based on specially designed criteria for disabled students. The study proves the effectiveness of the 3D virtual environment in improving the cognitive skills in the physics of students with learning disabilities.

Locally adaptive subspace and similarity metric learning for visual data clustering and retrieval	COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING			English	Article						locally embedded analysis; locally embedded clustering; locally adaptive retrieval; manifold; subspace learning; dimensionality reduction; similarity matching; image and video retrieval; visual clustering	VIDEO SHOT RETRIEVAL; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; PCA	Subspace and similarity metric learning are important issues for image and video analysis in the scenarios of both computer vision and multimedia fields. Many real-world applications, such as image clustering/labeling and video indexing/retrieval, involve feature space dimensionality reduction as well as feature matching metric learning. However, the loss of information from dimensionality reduction may degrade the accuracy of similarity matching. In practice, such basic conflicting requirements for both feature representation efficiency and similarity matching accuracy need to be appropriately addressed. In the style of "Thinking Globally and Fitting Locally", we develop Locally Embedded Analysis (LEA) based solutions for visual data clustering and retrieval. LEA reveals the essential low-dimensional manifold structure of the data by preserving the local nearest neighbor affinity, and allowing a linear sub-space embedding through solving a graph embedded eigenvalue decomposition problem. A visual data clustering algorithm, called Locally Embedded Clustering (LEC), and a local similarity metric learning algorithm for robust video retrieval, called Locally Adaptive Retrieval (LAR), are both designed upon the LEA approach, with variations in local affinity graph modeling. For large size database applications, instead of learning a global metric, we localize the metric learning space with kd-tree partition to localities identified by the indexing process. Simulation results demonstrate the effective performance of proposed solutions in both accuracy and speed aspects. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

These tend to be hierarchical, modular and exhibit repeating patterns. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) attempts to automate neural network design through learning network architecture and achieves state-of-the-art performance. We propose a framework for representing quantum circuit architectures using techniques from NAS, which enables search space design and architecture search. We use this framework to justify the importance of circuit architecture in quantum machine learning by generating a family of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) and evaluating them on a music genre classification dataset, GTZAN. Furthermore, we employ a genetic algorithm to perform Quantum Phase Recognition (QPR) as an example of architecture search with our representation. Finally, we implement the framework as an open-source Python package to enable dynamic circuit creation and facilitate circuit search space design for NAS.

Various neutralizing B cell epitopes of EV71 have been identified as potential vaccine candidates. Capsid-incorporation of antigens into adenovirus (Ad) has been developed for a novel vaccine approach. We constructed Ad3-based EV71 vaccine vectors by incorporating a neutralizing epitope SP70 containing 15 amino acids derived from capsid protein VP1 of EV71 within the different surface-exposed domains of the capsid protein hexon of Ad3EGFP, a recombinant adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein. Thermostability and growth kinetic assays suggested that the SP70 epitope incorporation into hypervariable region (HVR1, HVR2, or HVR7) of the hexon did not affect Ad fitness. The SP70 epitopes were thought to be exposed on all hexon-modified intact virion surfaces. Repeated administration of BALB/c mice with the modified Ads resulted in boosting of the anti-SP70 humoral immune response. Importantly, the modified Ads immunization of mother mice conferred protection in vivo to neonatal mice against the lethal EV71 challenge, and the modified Ads-immunized mice serum also conferred passive protection against the lethal challenge in newborn mice. Compared with the recombinant GST-fused SP70 protein immunization, immunization with the Ads containing SP70 in HVR1 or HVR2 elicited higher SP70-specific IgG titers, higher neutralization titers, and conferred more effective protection to neonatal mice. Thus, this study provides valuable information for hexon-modified Ad3 vector development as a promising EV71 vaccine candidate and as an epitope-delivering vehicle for other pathogens.

Study protocol: Insight 46-a neuroscience sub-study of the MRC National Survey of Health and Development	BMC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Epidemiology; Life course; Genetics; Alzheimer's Disease; Ageing; Magnetic resonance imaging; Positron emission tomography; Cognition; Vascular disease; Birth cohort	SUBJECTIVE COGNITIVE DECLINE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; INFORMANT INTERVIEW; BINDING DEFICITS; RATING-SCALE; LESIONS; RISK; RELIABILITY; VALIDATION; POPULATION	Background: Increasing age is the biggest risk factor for dementia, of which Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause. The pathological changes underpinning Alzheimer's disease are thought to develop at least a decade prior to the onset of symptoms. Molecular positron emission tomography and multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging allow key pathological processes underpinning cognitive impairment -including a-amyloid depostion, vascular disease, network breakdown and atrophy -to be assessed repeatedly and non-invasively. This enables potential determinants of dementia to be delineated earlier, and therefore opens a pre-symptomatic window where intervention may prevent the onset of cognitive symptoms. Methods/design: This paper outlines the clinical, cognitive and imaging protocol of "Insight 46", a neuroscience sub-study of the MRC National Survey of Health and Development. This is one of the oldest British birth cohort studies and has followed 5362 individuals since their birth in England, Scotland and Wales during one week in March 1946. These individuals have been tracked in 24 waves of data collection incorporating a wide range of health and functional measures, including repeat measures of cognitive function. Now aged 71 years, a small fraction have overt dementia, but estimates suggest that similar to 1/3 of individuals in this age group may be in the preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. Insight 46 is recruiting 500 study members selected at random from those who attended a clinical visit at 60-64 years and on whom relevant lifecourse data are available. We describe the sub-study design and protocol which involves a prospective two time-point (0, 24 month) data collection covering clinical, neuropsychological, beta-amyloid positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, biomarker and genetic information. Data collection started in 2015 (age 69) and aims to be completed in 2019 (age 73). Discussion: Through the integration of data on the socioeconomic environment and on physical, psychological and cognitive function from 0 to 69 years, coupled with genetics, structural and molecular imaging, and intensive cognitive and neurological phenotyping, Insight 46 aims to identify lifetime factors which influence brain health and cognitive ageing, with particular focus on Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease. This will provide an evidence base for the rational design of disease-modifying trials.

J	Parreño, MA; Schmid, B; Petchey, OL				Parreno, Maria Alejandra; Schmid, Bernhard; Petchey, Owen Leonard			Comparative study of the most tested hypotheses on relationships between biodiversity, productivity, light and nutrients	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Hypotheses testing; Plant communities; Systematic-review; Resource competition	RESOURCE AVAILABILITY; EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; PLANT DIVERSITY; COMPETITION; ECOLOGY; FERTILIZATION; MECHANISMS; BIOMASS; HETEROGENEITY	Many alternative hypotheses have been proposed about the mechanisms governing plant community structure and how plant species compete for resources. Seeking general conclusions requires identifying those hypotheses, describing them and comparing the results of the studies that tested them in a diversity of scenarios. However, comprehensive reviews and comparative studies on the hypotheses that have been actually tested rather than theoretically proposed are lacking. In this study, we focused on the relationships between four variables of interest to plant community and resource competition research: biodiversity, productivity, light and nutrients. We performed a novel type of systematic literature search in which we selected studies that had intended to quantify all four variables. From the shortlisted papers (88 out of 1557 initial), we identified causal interactions (effects) by doing a "backwards inference" from the statistical analyses, and assembled them as causal networks. We refer to each particular network as a tested hypothesis. The tested hypotheses that showed the same directionality of effects between the four variables of interest were simplified and grouped as compatible. We identified 43 hypotheses that could be classified into groups based on compatibility, with varying degrees of complexity in the number and directionality of relationships tested between variables. Only seven of these hypotheses had been tested in more than one study. The most tested hypothesis (47 times) has been one considering changes in nutrient amount (fertilization) as a sole effect variable driving changes in species richness, biomass and light penetration through canopy. Arguably, this is the simplest hypothesis and associated experimental design that one could think of for this system. Although more complex hypotheses that include indirect effect such as those of light penetration on biomass, would presumably better represent the higher complexity of the natural system, they have been tested only a handful of times each (2-21 times). Our results depict the landscape of hypotheses that have been tested for this system, a comparative description of their degrees of complexity, and information on available evidence. This information would be relevant to evaluate whether it is possible to proceed with more rigorous generalizations about mechanisms driving plant community structure. Moreover, our method facilitates the identification of knowledge gaps and mismatches between hypotheses, study designs and statistical tests being performed. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

It is a member of the glycosaminoglycan family of anionic polysaccharides with unique structural features designed for protein interaction and regulation. Its client proteins include soluble effectors (e.g. growth factors, morphogens, chemokines), membrane receptors and cell adhesion proteins such as fibronectin, fibrillin and various types of collagen. The protein-binding properties of HS, together with its strategic positioning in the pericellular domain, are indicative of key roles in mediating the flow of regulatory signals between cells and their microenvironment. The control of transmembrane signalling is a fundamental element in the complex biology of HS. It seems likely that, in some way, HS orchestrates diverse signalling pathways to facilitate information processing inside the cell. A dictionary definition of an orchestra is a large group of musicians who play together on various instruments ...' to paraphrase, the HS orchestra is a large group of proteins that play together on various receptors'. HS conducts this orchestra to ensure that proteins hit the right notes on their receptors but, in the manner of a true conductor, does it also set the musical pulse' and create rhythm and harmony attractive to the cell? This is too big a question to answer but fun to think about as you read this review.

A cross-cultural, online study	FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE			English	Article						Coffee; Shape; Mugs; Taste expectations; Cross-cultural; Online	CORRESPONDENCES; PERCEPTION; PREFERENCE; WEIGHT	We report a study designed to investigate whether shape-taste crossmodal correspondences would influence consumers' expectations concerning coffee. To that end, we conducted a cross-cultural online survey with respondents (N = 309) from China, Colombia, and the United Kingdom (UK). The participants had to rate eight coffee mugs on eight scales by arranging the mugs within a 1000 x 250 pixel box, placing each mug so that its horizontal position matched how strongly they thought the mug matched the scale presented. Amongst other findings, the results revealed that (1) the coffee was expected to be more aromatic from narrower diameter mugs, (2) the coffee associated with shorter mugs was expected to be both more bitter and more intense, and (3) the coffee was expected to be sweeter from wider diameter mugs. An interesting cross-cultural finding was that participants from the UK expected the mugs to be hotter than participants from either China or Colombia. These results add to a large and growing body of research highlighting the associations between visual information and a product's likely (or expected) sensory qualities. These findings may be useful to those preparing coffee as they suggest that coffee should be presented in certain mugs in order to convey a message that is congruent with the consumer's expectations.

INSTRUCTIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article						CSCL; Collaboration scripts; Prior knowledge; Text comprehension; Learning activities	BRAINSTORMING GROUPS; KNOWLEDGE; EXPLANATIONS; FRAMEWORK; PRODUCTIVITY; INSTRUCTION; PRINCIPLES; EXPERTISE; CLASSROOM; AWARENESS	Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) scripts can foster learners' deep text comprehension. However, this depends on (a) the extent to which the learning activities targeted by a script promote deep text comprehension and (b) whether the guidance level provided by the script is adequate to induce the targeted learning activities effectively; both may be moderated by the learners' prior knowledge. Inspired by the ICAP framework (Chi and Wylie in Educ Psychol 49:219-243, 2014), we designed a low (LGS) and a high guidance script (HGS) to support learners in performing interactive activities. These activities include generating outputs that go beyond the text, while simultaneously referring to the co-learner. In an experiment, 88 undergraduates were assigned randomly to either the LGS or HGS condition. After reading a text paragraph, LGS participants thought about discussion points for the upcoming collaborative discussion, while HGS participants were (a) prompted to generate outputs individually that go beyond the text and (b) exchange them with their co-learner to provide information about the co-learner's comprehension state (awareness induction). Subsequently, dyads in both conditions discussed the paragraph in a chat to improve their text comprehension. Prior knowledge moderated the effect of the script guidance level on deep text comprehension: low prior knowledge learners benefitted from the HGS, whereas high prior knowledge learners profited from the LGS. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that these effects can be traced back to patterns of learning activities which differed regarding learners' prior knowledge. Based on these results, possible directions for future research on CSCL scripting and ICAP are discussed.

Predominantly, human navigation on the Web has been thought to satisfy the memoryless Markov property stating that the next page a user visits only depends on her current page and not on previously visited ones. This idea has found its way in numerous applications such as Google's PageRank algorithm and others. Recently, new studies suggested that human navigation may better be modeled using higher order Markov chain models, i.e., the next page depends on a longer history of past clicks. Yet, this finding is preliminary and does not account for the higher complexity of higher order Markov chain models which is why the memoryless model is still widely used. In this work we thoroughly present a diverse array of advanced inference methods for determining the appropriate Markov chain order. We highlight strengths and weaknesses of each method and apply them for investigating memory and structure of human navigation on the Web. Our experiments reveal that the complexity of higher order models grows faster than their utility, and thus we confirm that the memoryless model represents a quite practical model for human navigation on a page level. However, when we expand our analysis to a topical level, where we abstract away from specific page transitions to transitions between topics, we find that the memoryless assumption is violated and specific regularities can be observed. We report results from experiments with two types of navigational datasets (goal-oriented vs. free form) and observe interesting structural differences that make a strong argument for more contextual studies of human navigation in future work.

Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) belongs to the field of culture, and the transmission of ICH is a kind of human-based cultural transmission, which is the shaping of people's morality, character, sentiment, will, ideals and beliefs, value orientation, humanistic cultivation, artistic taste, way of thinking, wisdom, and ability in the practice of production and life of various ethnic groups. Based on the status acquisition model, this study analyzed the human capital (HC), social capital (SC), and psychological capital (PC) of ICH bearers from three perspectives. In addition to the conventional socio-demographic factors such as gender, age, place of residence, and education level as control variables, status attainment was introduced as a dependent variable, and occupational identity, job satisfaction, and entrepreneurial ability were introduced as mediating variables to construct a conceptual model in the hope of exploring the multiple influencing factors of status attainment among ICH bearers. Interviews were used to gain, the feelings and knowledge of experts, scholars, and ICH bearers, to lay a solid qualitative research foundation for this study. A questionnaire survey was also conducted to obtain basic information and professional experiences of ICH bearers to provide real support for the research analysis and discussion. As per the results of this research, all the hypotheses were supported except, HC did not have any significant impact on JS. Furthermore, SC was not in a significant association with career identity. Moreover, career identity and status attainment did not have a significant relationship.

Toby			Target-flanker similarity effects reflect image segmentation not perceptual grouping	ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS			English	Article						Attention; Object-based; Attention; selective; Perceptual organization	OBJECT-BASED ATTENTION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; FOCUSED-ATTENTION; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; SPATIAL EXTENT; EFFECT SIZE; ORGANIZATION; FEATURES; SEARCH	When responding to the identity of a visual target, nearby stimuli (flankers) that are associated with the same response as the target cause faster and more accurate responding than flankers that are associated with different responses. Because this flanker-congruence effect (FCE) decreases with increasing target-flanker separation, it was thought to reflect limited precision of spatial selection mechanisms. Later studies, however, showed that FCEs are larger when the target and flankers are the same color compared to when they are different colors. This led to thegroup selection hypothesis, which states that flankers are perceptually grouped with the target and are obligatorily selected along with it, regardless of spatial separation. An alternative hypothesis, theimage segmentation hypothesis, states that feature differences facilitate the segmentation of visual information into relevant and irrelevant parts, thereby mitigating the limitations of spatial precision of selection mechanisms. We test between these hypotheses using a design in which targets and flankers are grouped or not grouped, while holding feature differences in the stimulus constant. Contrary to earlier results, we found that same-colored flankers do not yield larger FCEs than different-colored flankers when feature differences are held constant. We conclude that similarity effects on the FCE reflect differential support for image segmentation, on which selection depends, rather than the obligatory selection of perceptually grouped flankers and targets.

J	Van Schoors, R; Elen, J; Raes, A; Depaepe, F				Van Schoors, Rani; Elen, Jan; Raes, Annelies; Depaepe, Fien			An overview of 25 years of research on digital personalised learning in primary and secondary education: A systematic review of conceptual and methodological trends	BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Review						adaptive learning; adaptive technology; digital personalised learning; educational technology; systematic review	INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEM; COMPUTER; STUDENTS; INSTRUCTION; ACHIEVEMENT; COMPREHENSION; GAMIFICATION; TECHNOLOGY; DIAGNOSIS; FRAMEWORK	Due to the increasing digitisation, interest in digital personalised learning (DPL) continues to grow. Many empirical studies on the effect of adaptive tools have used a wide variety of conceptualisations and operationalisations of DPL. This systematic review aims to address the lack of consensus by presenting an analysis of empirical studies on technology for DPL in primary and secondary education. The work is guided by the following questions: (1) What are some different conceptualisations used in DPL research? (2) What types of tools are used in the studies and how are they implemented? (3) What is the current evidence on the impact of DPL with regard to student outcomes considering the nature of the current studies? A Boolean search string was used in the databases Web of Science and ERIC, resulting in a dataset containing 6,908 papers. A screening based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria yielded 53 papers. Our findings revealed a great diversity in DPL conceptualisations, with several authors not defining the concept and others providing information regarding different elements such as technology, personalisation, personalisation target, personalisation source, personalisation method and personalisation outcomes. In line with these differences in conceptualisation of DPL, several DPL tools were used across the studies. Concerning the impact of DPL, a positive trend was observed on learning outcomes, although methodological differences need to be considered. The review ends with guidelines for future research. Practitioner notes What is already known There are many definitions and terms concerning DPL, resulting in a lack of consensus in conceptualisation. There is a wide variety of DPL tools with different adaptive dimensions. Many authors emphasise the benefits of DPL in educational practice including a possible impact on learning gains. What this paper adds Contribution to a thorough understanding of the conceptualisation of DPL. Insights into the diversity in DPL tools building on a framework of adaptivity by Vandewaetere and Clarebout (2014) and adds focus on tool implementation as a context element. Insight into the impact of DPL taking into account study design and outcome indicators. Implications for practice and/or policy An overview of the affordances of DPL to educational researchers, educational policy makers, and teachers is provided that can encourage them to think about its opportunities for everyday practice. Concrete suggestions for future research are discussed.

Intelligent manufacturing is characterised by autonomy and self-optimisation, which proposes new demands such as learning and cognitive capacities for manufacturing cell, known as the minimum implementation unit for intelligent manufacturing. Consequently, this paper proposes a general framework for knowledge-driven digital twin manufacturing cell (KDTMC) towards intelligent manufacturing, which could support autonomous manufacturing by an intelligent perceiving, simulating, understanding, predicting, optimising and controlling strategy. Three key enabling technologies including digital twin model, dynamic knowledge bases and knowledge-based intelligent skills for supporting the above strategy are analysed, which equip KDTMC with the capacities of self-thinking, self-decision-making, self-execution and self-improving. The implementing methods of KDTMC are also introduced by a thus constructed test bed. Three application examples about intelligent process planning, intelligent production scheduling and production process analysis and dynamic regulation demonstrate the feasibility of KDTMC, which provides a practical insight into the intelligent manufacturing paradigm.

J	Macaulay, JO; Nagley, P				Macaulay, Janet Olwyn; Nagley, Phillip			Student project cases: a learner-centred team activity broadly integrated across the undergraduate medical curriculum	MEDICAL TEACHER			English	Article								Background: Student Project Cases (SPCs) in the Monash University medical curriculum comprise a teamwork activity that emphasises interdisciplinary learning. SPCs provide a learning program contextualized within the broader medical curriculum, in which students research and present a medical disease. SPCs were introduced into the medical curriculum to integrate more active learning by creating a learning environment which: actively engages students in the learning process and encourages deep approaches to learning, promotes self-directed learning, develops the ability to work in teams, builds information gathering and processing skills, and develops presentation skills. Methods: The design of the SPCs requires students to: make decisions regarding the overall organisation of their group and presentations, communicate and work as members of small groups, research, identify, critically analyse, synthesize and integrate information, and prepare and communicate via written and oral presentations. To ensure effective and consistent assessment practices, an extensive series of simple and effective proformas were developed, including components of peer, self and staff assessment. Assessors utilise objective observations of student performance or achievement; numerical marks are independently based on specific descriptors aligned with learning objectives. The effectiveness of SPCs was evaluated through questionnaires, focus groups and informal feedback, involving both students and staff. Conclusion: The assessment proformas were successful learning aids for the students and allowed staff to critique student performance in a non-subjective manner. The SPCs are a successful active learning program which engages students and encourages deep learning and could readily be adapted by a diverse range of courses. The SPCs also develop graduate attributes of life-long learning skills including: capacity for inquiry and research, critical thought and analysis, problem solving, teamwork and written and oral communication. Additional benefits encompass enhanced student appreciation of learning and assessment as well as development of confidence in addressing new or complex tasks.

For this purpose, an onion-ring system called COSSOL has been built in a case study for Twitter, following a hybrid approach to integrate Machine Learning classifiers and structural metrics from Computational Linguistics and Computational Sociology disciplines, respectively. The paper designs two experimentation scenarios divided into cases of collective subjectivity analysis for Colombia under different levels of communities' granularity. The first case validates the system by performing a cointegration test on the metrics of each construct for the onion rings' communities. The results show that some communities better propagate their subjective expressions against the disclosed topic when they have a higher network density and a common polarity. Moreover, the most stable communities in polarity towards a topic are those whose members are highly connected. Conversely, communities with a higher centrality index in a subset of members do not exhibit stability in collective subjectivity towards a topic disclosed in that community. The second case validates the model with a series of Social Network Analysis (SNA) metrics with a polarity layer to describe the second onion ring subcommunities and their temporal variation through community recalculation. The results show no polar distributions similar to the bimodal ones representing consensus in the values of the common Thinking Acting and Feeling (TAF) forms. In addition, general negative sentiment is identified for the ten most representative nodes of the subcommunities analyzed.

J	Ung, COL; Hu, YJ; Hu, H; Bian, Y				Ung, Carolina Oi Lam; Hu, Yuanjia; Hu, Hao; Bian, Ying			Investigating the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccination in Macao: implications for vaccination strategies	BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						COVID-19; Vaccination; Intention; Strategy; Social responsibility	HERD-IMMUNITY; HEALTH; HESITANCY; DECISIONS; IMPACT	Background Understanding the intention of receiving COVID-19 vaccines is important to inform effective vaccination strategies. This study aimed to investigate such intention, identify the key influencing factors, and determine the most important intention predictors using a theoretically principled model. Methods An online, cross-sectional survey method was implemented in Macao in May 2021. People aged 18 years or above and residing in Macao for 12 months prior to the study were recruited through social media. Intention to receive COVID-19 vaccines and the main constructs of the protection motivation theory and the health belief model were the main measures encompassing threat appraisal, intrapersonal characteristics, cues to action, coping appraisal, past experiences and information seeking behavior. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression were used for data analysis. Results A total of 552 valid responses were received. Among the respondents, 79.5% aged between 25 and 54 years old, 59.4% were female, and 88% had a bachelor degree or above; 62.3% of the respondents indicated their intention to receive COVID-19 vaccination while 19.2% were hesitant and 18.5% did not have any intention. While 67.0% believed COVID-19 infection was life-threatening, only 19.0% thought they were at risk of getting infected. Control variables such as age, gender, education level, and having travel plans were significantly correlated with intention. Significant associations between intention with perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, maladaptive response reward, self-efficacy, response-efficacy, response cost, social attitude, social norm, past experience and information seeking behavior were identified (P < 0.05). The most important positive predictors of intention were "being able to make arrangement to receive the vaccine" (beta = 0.333, P < 0.001), "a sense of social responsibility" (beta = 0.326, P < 0.001), and "time off from work after vaccination" (beta = 0.169, P < 0.001), whereas "concerns over vaccine safety" (beta = - 0.124, P < 0.001) and "relying on online resources for vaccine information" (beta = - 0.065, P < 0.05) were negative predictors. Perceived severity in terms of COVID-19 being a life threatening illness was not a predictor of intention. Conclusion This study reaffirmed that intention to receive COVID-19 vaccination is an ongoing concern in the combat of the pandemic. Multi-component strategies to enhance health literacy that supports well-informed decision-making, increase vaccination convenience, promote social responsibility, and provide time-off incentives are among the key considerations in designing and improve vaccination campaigns in Macao.

Horse owners' biosecurity practices following the first equine influenza outbreak in Australia	PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE			English	Article						Biosecurity; Equine; Owner perceptions; Ordinal logistic regression	ATTITUDE-CHANGE; FEAR APPEALS; PROTECTION; MOTIVATION; BEHAVIORS; EPIDEMIC; EFFICACY	A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 759 Australian horse owners to determine their biosecurity practices and perceptions one year after the 2007 equine influenza outbreak and to investigate the factors influencing these perceptions and practices. A web link to an online questionnaire was sent to 1224 horse owners as a follow-up to a previous study to obtain information about biosecurity perceptions and practices, impacts of the 2007 El outbreak, demographic information and information about horse industry involvement. Ordinal logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine factors associated with poor biosecurity practices. Biosecurity compliance (low, medium, high), as determined by horse owners' responses to a 16-item question on the frequency of various biosecurity measures, was used as the outcome variable in ordinal logistic regression analyses. Variables with a univariable p-value <= 0.2 were eligible for inclusion in multivariable models built using a manual stepwise approach. Variables with a p-value <0.05 in multivariable models were retained in the final model. Two potential confounders - age and gender of participants - were included in the final model irrespective of their p-values. Thirty percent of the respondents had low biosecurity compliance and were performing biosecurity practices 'not very often' or 'never'. Younger people, people with two or more children, those who were not involved with horses commercially and those who had no long-term business impacts resulting from the 2007 El outbreak were more likely to have lower biosecurity compliance. People who were not fearful of a future outbreak of equine influenza in Australia and those who thought their current hygiene and access control practices were not very effective in protecting their horses also had poor biosecurity practices. In this observational study we identified factors associated with a group of horse owners with low levels of biosecurity compliance. As this cross-sectional study only assesses associations, the identified factors should be further investigated in order to be considered in the design of extension activities to increase horse owners' biosecurity compliance.

Both laypeople and healthcare professionals often misinterpret treatment effects that are presented as relative risk reduction. Therefore, we developed and piloted a web-based tool to teach the difference between relative and absolute risk reductions. This project follows the UKMRC-guidance for complex interventions. The tool was developed based on adult learning and design theories. This was followed by a qualitative feasibility study focusing on acceptance, applicability, and comprehensibility with healthcare professionals and laypersons. We conducted think-aloud and semi-structured interviews and analysed them using qualitative content analysis. In addition, we explored calculation skills. Between January 2020 and April 2021, we conducted 22 interviews with 8 laypeople and 14 healthcare professionals from different settings. Overall, the tool proved to be feasible and relevant. With regard to comprehension, we observed an awareness of the interpretation of risk reduction, presented therapy effects were questioned more critically, and the influence of relative effects was recognized. Nevertheless, there were comprehension problems in some of the participants, especially with calculations in connection with low mathematical skills. The tool can be used to improve the interpretation of risk reductions in various target groups and to supplement existing educational programs.

Motives and perceptions regarding electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) use among adults with mental health conditions	ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Article						Mental health conditions; Electronic nicotine delivery devices; E-cigarettes; Risk perceptions	NATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEY; E-CIGARETTE USE; SMOKING-CESSATION; TOBACCO USE; RELATIVE HARM; SMOKERS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; INDIVIDUALS; COMORBIDITY; DEPENDENCE	Background: Smoking rates are disproportionately high among adults with mental health conditions (MHC), and recent research suggests that among former smokers, those with MHC are more likely to use electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). This study investigated reasons for ENDS use and related risk perceptions among individuals with versus without MHC. Methods: Among adult current ENDS users (n = 550), associations between self-reported MHC diagnoses and motives for ENDS use and ENDS risk perceptions were examined, stratified by smoking status. Results: There were no significant associations between MHC status and ENDS motives or perceptions in the overall sample. However, current smokers with MHC indicated thinking more about how ENDS might improve their health, and former smokers with MHC reported thinking less about how ENDS might harm their health, compared to their counterparts without MHC. Former smokers with MHC rated several reasons for ENDS use (e.g., less harmful than regular cigarettes; to quit smoking; appealing flavors) as more important than did those without MHC. Conclusions: Current and former smokers with MHC may be especially optimistic about health benefits of ENDS. However, they might also be prone to health risks of continued ENDS use or concurrent use with traditional cigarettes. It will be important for public health messaging to provide this population with accurate information about benefits and risks of ENDS.

Study of physiological responses to acute carbon monoxide exposure with a human patient simulator	ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						simulation; physiological adaptation; mining; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; coal workers' pneumoconiosis		Human patient simulators are widely used to train health professionals and students in a clinical setting, but they also can be used to enhance physiology education in a laboratory setting. Our course incorporates the human patient simulator for experiential learning in which undergraduate university juniors and seniors are instructed to design, conduct, and present (orally and in written form) their project testing physiological adaptation to an extreme environment. This article is a student report on the physiological response to acute carbon monoxide exposure in a simulated healthy adult male and a coal miner and represents how 1) human patient simulators can be used in a nonclinical way for experiential hypothesis testing; 2) students can transition from traditional textbook learning to practical application of their knowledge; and 3) student-initiated group investigation drives critical thought. While the course instructors remain available for consultation throughout the project, the relatively unstructured framework of the assignment drives the students to create an experiment independently, troubleshoot problems, and interpret the results. The only stipulation of the project is that the students must generate an experiment that is physiologically realistic and that requires them to search out and incorporate appropriate data from primary scientific literature. In this context, the human patient simulator is a viable educational tool for teaching integrative physiology in a laboratory environment by bridging textual information with experiential investigation.

Advanced AMD takes two forms, neovascular (wet) and atrophic (dry). Stargardt disease (STGD) is the commonest form of inherited macular dystrophy. Objective: To carry out a systematic review of treatments for dry AMD and STGD, and to identify emerging treatments where future NIHR research might be commissioned. Design: Systematic review. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library from 2005 to 13 July 2017 for reviews, journal articles and meeting abstracts. We looked for studies of interventions that aim to preserve or restore vision in people with dry AMD or STGD. The most important outcomes are those that matter to patients: visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity, reading speed, ability to drive, adverse effects of treatment, quality of life, progression of disease and patient preference. However, visual loss is a late event and intermediate predictors of future decline were accepted if there was good evidence that they are strong predictors of subsequent visual outcomes. These include changes detectable by investigation, but not necessarily noticed by people with AMD or STGD. ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization search portal and the UK Clinical Trials gateway were searched for ongoing and recently completed clinical trials. Results: The titles and abstracts of 7948 articles were screened for inclusion. The full text of 398 articles were obtained for further screening and checking of references and 112 articles were included in the final report. Overall, there were disappointingly few good-quality studies (including of sufficient size and duration) reporting useful outcomes, particularly in STGD. However we did identify a number of promising research topics, including drug treatments, stem cells, new forms of laser treatment, and implantable intraocular lens telescopes. In many cases, research is already under way, funded by industry or governments. Limitations: In AMD, the main limitation came from the poor quality of much of the evidence. Many studies used VA as their main outcome despite not having sufficient duration to observe changes. The evidence on treatments for STGD is sparse. Most studies tested interventions with no comparison group, were far too short term, and the quality of some studies was poor. Future work: We think that the topics on which the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and Efficacy Mechanism and Evaluation (EME) programmes might consider commissioning primary research are in STGD, a HTA trial of fenretinide (ReVision Therapeutics, San Diego, CA, USA), a visual cycle inhibitor, and EME research into the value of lutein and zeaxanthin supplements, using short-term measures of retinal function. In AMD, we suggest trials of fenretinide and of a potent statin. There is epidemiological evidence from the USA that the drug, levodopa, used for treating Parkinson's disease, may reduce the incidence of AMD. We suggest that similar research should be carried out using the large general practice databases in the UK. Ideally, future research should be at earlier stages in both diseases, before vision is impaired, using sensitive measures of macular function. This may require early detection of AMD by screening.

J	Vessel, EA; Starr, GG; Rubin, N				Vessel, Edward A.; Gabrielle Starr, G.; Rubin, Nava			Art reaches within: aesthetic experience, the self and the default mode network	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						neuroaesthetics; art; default mode network; self-relevance; medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC); fMRI; visual; individual differences	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FACIAL ATTRACTIVENESS; SUBJECTIVE VALUE; DECISION-MAKING; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EMOTION; BEAUTY; REWARD; FMRI; RELEVANCE	In a task of rating images of artworks in an fMRI scanner, regions in the medial prefrontal cortex that are known to be part of the default mode network (DMN) were positively activated on the highest-rated trials. This is surprising given the DMN's original characterization as the set of brain regions that show greater fMRI activity during rest periods than during performance of tasks requiring focus on external stimuli. But further research showed that DMN regions could be positively activated also in structured tasks, if those tasks involved self-referential thought or self-relevant information. How may our findings be understood in this context? Although our task had no explicit self-referential aspect and the stimuli had no a priori self-relevance to the observers, the experimental design we employed emphasized the personal aspects of aesthetic experience. Observers were told that we were interested in their individual tastes, and asked to base their ratings on how much each artwork "moved" them. Moreover, we used little-known artworks that covered a wide range of styles, which led to high individual variability: each artwork was rated highly by some observers and poorly by others. This means that rating-specific neural responses cannot be attributed to the features of any particular artworks, but rather to the aesthetic experience itself. The DMN activity therefore suggests that certain artworks, albeit unfamiliar, may be so well-matched to an individual's unique makeup that they obtain access to the neural substrates concerned with the self access which other external stimuli normally do not get. This mediates a sense of being "moved," or "touched from within." This account is consistent with the modern notion that individuals' taste in art is linked with their sense of identity, and suggests that DMN activity may serve to signal "self-relevance" in a broader sense than has been thought so far.

J	Özdemir, A; Özdagoglu, G				Ozdemir, Asli; Ozdagoglu, Guzin			Predicting product demand from small-sized data: grey models	GREY SYSTEMS-THEORY AND APPLICATION			English	Article						Grey models; Demand prediction; Grey-Markov model; Textile product		Purpose - Prediction problems raised in uncertain environments require different solution approaches such as grey prediction models, which consider uncertainty in information and also enable the use of small data sets. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the comparative performances of grey prediction models (GM) and Markov chain integrated grey models in a demand prediction problem. Design/methodology/approach - The modeling process of grey models is initially described, and then an integrated model called the Grey-Markov model is presented for the convenience of applications. The analyses are conducted on a monthly demand prediction problem to demonstrate the modeling accuracies of the GM (1,1), GM (2,1), GM (1,1)-Markov, and GM (2,1)-Markov models. Findings - Numerical results reveal that the Grey-Markov model based on GM (2,1) achieves better prediction performance than the other models. Practical implications - It is thought that the methodology and the findings of the study will be a significant reference for both academics and executives who struggle with similar demand prediction problems in their fields of interest. Originality/value - The novelty of this study comes from the fact that the GM (2,1)-Markov model has been first used for demand prediction. Furthermore, the GM (2,1)-Markov model represents a relatively new approach, and this is the second paper that addresses the GM (2,1)-Markov model in any area.

The 3.2 fs pulse was converted into the ultraviolet by third harmonic generation, the pulse width being evaluated to 1.9 fs. The near-infrared pulse (3.2 fs) was employed as an ionization source in mass spectrometry, and the signal intensity was significantly increased for pentachlorobenzene, an environmental pollutant listed in the Stockholm Convention. The present data and the spectral properties obtained by quantum chemical calculations suggest that the method offers a potential advantage for the detection of Novichok, a chemical warfare agent that is thought to have been used in a terrorist attack.

The 2017 August 17th detection of the GW170817 gravitational-wave (GW) signal by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo in coincidence with the electromagnetic observation of the SGRB GRB 170817A confirmed this scenario and provided new physical information on the nature of these astronomical events. We use SGRB observations by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Burst Alert Telescope and GW170817/GRB 170817A observational data to estimate the detection rate of coincident GW and electromagnetic observations by a GW detector network and constrain the physical parameters of the SGRB jet structure. We estimate the rate of GW detections coincident with SGRB electromagnetic detections by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor to be between similar to 0.1 and similar to 0.6 yr(-1) in the third LIGO-Virgo observing run and between similar to 0.3 and similar to 1.8 yr(-1) for the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network at design sensitivity. Assuming a structured model with a uniform ultrarelativistic jet surrounded by a region with power-law decay emission, we find the jet half-opening angle and the power-law decay exponent to be theta(c) similar to 7 degrees-22 degrees and s similar to 5-30 at a 1 sigma confidence level, respectively.

The research data were collected by using a "descriptive information form", a "semi-structured interview form", and the "numerical rating scale" through the "in-depth interview method". The study sample consisted of 16 patients who were aged 18 years or older, had undergone cardiac surgery, experienced pain post-operatively in the intensive care unit at least once, and had intensive care experience. Patients with neuropathic or chronic pain or neurological or psychiatric disorders were not included in the study. Data were classified into physiologic, self-concept, and interdependence modes according to RAM.ResultsThe themes and sub-themes that emerged included physiologic modes (pain responses), self-concept modes (pain self-management), role-function modes (effects of pain), and interdependence modes (support systems in pain).ConclusionsThe results of our study can enable patients and nurses to communicate effectively about pain. In future studies, the effect of model-based pain management programs on cardiac surgery patients can be investigated.Relevance to Clinical PracticeExamining the pain perceptions of intensive care patients after cardiac surgery according to RAM will guide the improvement and development of pain management. It is thought that the model addresses intensive care patients experiencing pain holistically.

J	Liu, P; Du, MQ; Li, TT				Liu, Peng; Du, Manqing; Li, Tingting			Psychological consequences of legal responsibility misattribution associated with automated vehicles	ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Automated vehicles; Legal responsibility misattribution; Fairness; Reasonableness	MIND; ACCEPTANCE; MACHINES	A human driver and an automated driving system (ADS) might share control of automated vehicles (AVs) in the near future. This raises many concerns associated with the assignment of responsibility for negative outcomes caused by them; one is that the human driver might be required to bear the brunt of moral and legal responsibilities. The psychological consequences of responsibility misattribution have not yet been examined. We designed a hypothetical crash similar to Uber's 2018 fatal crash (which was jointly caused by its distracted driver and the malfunctioning ADS). We incorporated five legal responsibility attributions (the human driver should bear full, primary, half, secondary, and no liability, that is, the AV manufacturer should bear no, secondary, half, primary, and full liability). Participants (N = 1524) chose their preferred liability attribution and then were randomly assigned into one of the five actual liability attribution conditions. They then responded to a series of questions concerning liability assignment (fairness and reasonableness), the crash (e.g., acceptability), and AVs (e.g., intention to buy and trust). Slightly more than 50% of participants thought that the human driver should bear full or primary liability. Legal responsibility misattribution (operationalized as the difference between actual and preferred liability attributions) negatively influenced these mentioned responses, regardless of overly attributing human or manufacturer liability. Overly attributing human liability (vs. manufacturer liability) had more negative influences. Improper liability attribution might hinder the adoption of AVs. Public opinion should not be ignored in developing a legal framework for AVs.

Influence of physical contact on neuromuscular fatigue and markers of muscle damage following small-sided games	JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE IN SPORT			English	Article						Contact sports; GPS; Neuromuscular; Training games; Wrestling; Tackling	PERCEIVED EXERTION; MATCH DEMANDS; SKILL DEMANDS; LEAGUE; RESPONSES; RELIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; JUNIOR; COMPETITION; COLLISION	Objectives: Physical contact is frequent in rugby league competition and is thought to be a major contributor to the fatigue and creatine kinase (CK) response, although direct evidence is lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence that physical contact had on the fatigue and CK response to small-sided games. Design: Cross-over, counter-balanced study. Methods: Twenty-three junior elite rugby league players were divided into two groups. Group one played a contact game on day 1 before playing a non-contact game 72 h later; group two played the games in reverse order. The rules were identical for each game, with the only difference being a 10 s contact bout every 50 s during the contact game. Upper and lower body neuromuscular fatigue and blood concentrations of CK were assessed immediately before, immediately after, and 12 and 24 h after the games. During each game, players wore global positioning system units to provide information on movements. Results: CK increased after both games, peaking immediately following the non-contact game; CK was still rising 24 h following the contact game. The difference between the two conditions was practically meaningful at this point (likelihood = likely, 82%; ES = 0.86). There were moderate to large reductions in upper body power following the contact game (ES = -0.74 to -1.86), and no reductions following the non-contact game. Conclusions: This study indicates that large increases in blood CK and upper body fatigue result from physical contact. Training sessions involving physical contact should be performed well in advance of scheduled games. (C) 2013 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Killian, CM; Woods, AM				Killian, Chad M.; Woods, Amelia Mays			Physical education students' usage and perceptions of a supplemental online health-related fitness knowledge curriculum (iPE)	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL EDUCATION REVIEW			English	Article						Digital learning; technology adoption; high school; blended learning	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; ACCEPTANCE; EXPERIENCES; TEACHERS	The purpose of this study was to explore high school physical education students' usage and perceptions of a supplemental online health-related fitness knowledge curriculum through the lens of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Individual interviews were conducted with 37 students who were enrolled in a ninth-grade physical education class. The course used an externally provided online curriculum designed to deliver and assess health-related fitness knowledge. Initial themes were generated using open and axial coding compiled into a codebook. The codebook was pilot-tested and finalized following peer debriefing sessions. Four main themes were developed: Home(room), Alone; Easy to Use, Easier to Ignore; Disconnected and Conflicted; and Low Value, Low Priority. Students completed their online work alone, but location and devices varied. Most thought the online platform was easy to navigate, and many completed multiple modules at once. Students sensed that the online content was disconnected from face-to-face physical education and questioned why they were required to engage in sedentary online learning for a physically active course. They also expressed difficulty understanding the value of the online content and assigned a low priority to completing it as a result. Implementing a supplemental online physical education curriculum presents challenges given the relative novelty of the modality within the subject. This study highlights the important role system design plays in the online learning process. It also illustrates the responsibility teachers have in helping students see the value of online learning opportunities by making connections to their own lives.

Trait mindfulness predicts the presence but not the magnitude of cortisol responses to acute stress	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Mindfulness; Cortisol; Stress; Acute; Trait	ACUTE PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; YOUNG-ADULTS; INTERVENTION; DEPRESSION; MEDIATORS; PSORIASIS; CHILDREN; SALIVARY; RHYTHMS	Background: Mindfulness, or the practice of observing present moment experiences with acceptance, is thought to improve health at least partially by limiting hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis over-responsiveness during episodes of acute stress. However, models of allostatic load suggest that HPA axis under-responsiveness can also be detrimental to health, and the relationship between mindfulness and cortisol under-responsiveness has yet to be examined. The present study therefore aimed to address this knowledge gap, and to revisit the relationship between mindfulness and acute cortisol response magnitude while excluding (or statistically controlling for) individuals displaying HPA axis under-responsiveness. Methods: Participants (124 healthy undergraduate students) were subjected to a stressful speech task, and completed a trait mindfulness questionnaire. Salivary cortisol was collected 0, +15, +25, +40, and +55 min post-stressor onset. Results: Greater trait mindfulness was associated with greater odds of displaying a cortisol response relative to none, but was unrelated to the magnitude of cortisol responses among those who displayed an acute response. Conclusions: In the present sample, trait mindfulness was associated with cortisol responses, but this was driven by the fact that subjects low in mindfulness were more likely to be non-responders. Contrasting the effects of mindfulness on the presence (i.e., present vs. absent) and the degree (i.e., magnitude) of acute stress responses may therefore be warranted in future research.

A one-sided pitch-catch setup was used in the detection and evaluation of ultrasonic wave behavior and fiber orientation in the unidirectional CFRP composite laminates. Two Rayleigh wave transducers were joined head-to-head and used in the pitch-catch mode on the surface of the composites. The pitch-catch signal was found to be more sensitive than normal incidence backwall echo of longitudinal wave to subtle flaw conditions in the composite. Especially, one-sided ultrasonic measurement was made with using a Rayleigh wave transducers and the Rayleigh ultrasonic waves were extensively characterized in the CFRP composite laminates. Also, a conventional scanner was used in an immersion tank for extracting fiber orientation information in the unidirectional laminate. Therefore, it is thought that the proposed method is useful to evaluate integrity of CFRP laminates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Design Prospective questionnaire study. Questionnaires were sent to patients within one month of surgery. Responses were analysed with frequencies and single variable analyses. Setting Large teaching hospital. Participants 732 patients who had undergone surgery in obstetrics and gynaecology over a six month period. Main outcome measures Patients' awareness of the legal implications of written consent and their views on the function and remit of the consent form. Results Patients had limited understanding of the legal standing of written consent. Nearly half (46%, 95% confidence interval 43% to 50%) of patients believed the primary function of consent forms was to protect hospitals and 68% (65% to 71%) thought consent forms allowed doctors to assume control. Only 41% (37% to 44%) of patients believed consent forms made their wishes known. Conclusions Many patients seem to have limited awareness of the legal implications of signing or not signing consent forms, and they do not recognise Written consent as primarily serving their interests.

J	Johannisson, J; Hiete, M				Johannisson, Jonas; Hiete, Michael			Environmental service-learning approach in higher education - a descriptive case study on student-led life cycle assessments of university cafeteria meals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Case study; Life cycle assessment; LCA; Sustainability; Higher education; Service-learning; Problem-based learning	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; REAL-WORLD; ECO-LABELS; COMMUNITY; PARTNERSHIPS; CLASSROOM; LCA; FRAMEWORK; LITERACY; THINKING	Purpose This study aims to share experiences of an easy to adapt service-learning approach in a graduate course on life cycle assessment (LCA). Specifically, it reports on how students helped the university's cafeteria to assess meals by conducting an LCA for 25 meals and identifying environmental hotspots. Design/methodology/approach A descriptive case study of a graduate course at Ulm University is presented. The course included lectures and problem-based exercises, both theoretical and software assisted. A course evaluation was conducted during the course and one year after completion to poll improvement potentials, as well as its impacts on students' everyday life. Findings It was found that although it was the first LCA for all students, the resulting LCA information of 25 different meals were homogeneous, comparable to the scientific literature and beneficial to the cafeteria's sustainable development strategy. The concept of service-learning had a higher impact on students' motivation than a good grade and active-learning is explicitly requested by students. The course design sensitized students to the real-life problems of LCA and made their consumption patterns more elaborate and ecological. Furthermore, this digitization of higher education could be carried out with only minor changes in the present COVID-19 pandemic situation. Originality/value As the subject of service-learning in natural sciences is still expandable, this study presents an easy to adapt case study on how to integrate such an approach into university curricula dominated by traditional learning. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this case study presents the first published LCA university course explicitly describing and evaluating a service-learning approach. The topic touches the everyday lives of students, allows comparisons between different student groups, is easily scalable to different group sizes and credits, and supports learning both how to study in small groups and cooperation between groups to ensure comparability of LCA results.

In the presented empirical study, we compared the features of real 3D (stereoscopic) versus pseudo 3D (monoscopic) geovisualizations in static and interactive digital elevation models. We tested 39 high-school students in their ability to identify the correct terrain profile from digital elevation models. Students' performance was recorded and further analysed with respect to their spatial abilities, which were measured by a psychological mental rotation test and think aloud protocol. The results of the study indicated that the influence of the type of 3D visualization (monoscopic/stereoscopic) on the performance of the users is not clear, the level of navigational interactivity has significant influence on the usability of a particular 3D visualization, and finally no influences of the spatial abilities on the performance of the user within the 3D environment were identified.

J	Günay, U; Kilinç, G				Gunay, Ulviye; Kilinc, Gulsen			The transfer of theoretical knowledge to clinical practice by nursing students and the difficulties they experience: A qualitative study	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Article						Nursing students; Theoretical knowledge; Clinical practice; Difficulties; Experience; Transfer Qualitative study	LEARNING-ENVIRONMENT; PERCEIVED STRESSORS; PERCEPTIONS; NURSES; TURKEY; EDUCATION; EXPECTATIONS	Background: Nursing education contains both theoretical and practical training processes. Clinical training is the basis of nursing education. The quality of clinical training is closely related to the quality of the clinical learning environment. Objectives: This study aimed to determine the transfer of theoretical knowledge into clinical practice by nursing students and the difficulties they experience during this process. Methods: A qualitative research design was used in the study. The study was conducted in 2015 with 30 nursing students in a university located in the east of Turkey, constituting three focus groups. The questions directed to the students during the focus group interviews were as follows: What do you think about your clinical training? How do you evaluate yourself in the process of putting your theoretical knowledge into clinical practice? What kind of difficulties are you experiencing in clinical practices? Results: The data were interpreted using the method of content analysis. Most of the students reported that theoretical information they received was excessive, their ability to put most of this information into practice was weak, and they lacked courage to touch patients for fear of implementing procedures incorrectly. As a result of the analysis of the data, five main themes were determined: clinical training, guidance and communication, hospital environment and expectations. Conclusions: The results of this study showed that nursing students found their clinical knowledge and skills insufficient and usually failed to transfer their theoretical knowledge into clinical practices. The study observed that nursing students experienced various issues in clinical practices. In order to fix these issues and achieve an effective clinical training environment, collaboration should be achieved among nursing instructors, nurses, nursing school and hospital managements. Additionally, the number of nursing educators should be increased and training programs should be provided regarding effective clinical training methods.

Although better known as antibacterial agents, many peptides have demonstrated activity against the malarial parasite Plasmodium either in its vertebrate blood stages or mosquito stages or both. The antimalarial peptides reviewed here consist of (i) cationic, amphipathic 'host-defence' peptides including some (e. g. defensins and cecropins) that are naturally produced by mosquitos, (ii) other membrane-active peptide antibiotics such as gramicidins, (iii) hydrophobic peptides, most notably cyclosporins, (iv) thiopeptides, such as thiostrepton, and (v) some other naturally occurring or synthetic peptides. Many of these peptides affect membrane integrity and some are selective for parasite membranes over those of the host, while others are thought to have more specific intracellular targets. The mechanisms of action of the majority of antimalarial peptides are however either uncertain or totally unknown. Very few of these agents have been tested in rodent malaria models and none has undergone significant pre-clinical or clinical development for malaria. Issues such as metabolic lability, high cost, and a lack of information about systemic toxicity are likely to be serious obstacles to further development of peptides as antimalarial drugs. On the other hand, they offer potential advantages, including the possibility of being much less prone to resistance than the drugs in current use. An alternative to conventional chemotherapy, namely the release of malaria-refractory, transgenic mosquitos overproducing antimalarial peptides, has already passed the 'proof of concept' stage.

These changes present challenges for frontline professionals working with immigrant parents raising children with disabilities. This article explored service providers' perspectives on the challenges they face in delivering services to immigrant adolescents and young adults with disabilities aged 16-25. The study generated qualitative data from seven informants from different state institutions using semi-structured interviews. Our findings showed that service providers encountered personal and organisational challenges, including communicating and collaborating with immigrant parents. Service agencies experienced underfunding, making them unable to cope with growing demands. Additionally, service providers experienced inter-agency cooperation and collaboration difficulties such as a lack of information sharing, even when they served the same clients. Increasing funding, staff training, and strengthening formal and informal communication with immigrant parents of children with disabilities can provide opportunities to improve service delivery. Point of interest The Norwegian service apparatuses were designed to serve a homogenous population. Adjusting to a diversifying working environment by service providers was necessary to enhance service delivery. Service providers considered low participation by immigrant parents of disabled children in school activities had negative impacts on home-school partnership. They thought some immigrant parents were uninterested in the academic life of their children. Service providers faced communication challenges in service delivery because of language and cultural barriers. The use of untrained cultural brokers and translators was unhelpful in bridging the cultural and communication gaps. Service providers experience work pressure because of insufficient resources and a lack of cooperation and information sharing between agencies. The authors observed that agencies did not coordinate their activities. The study shows a need for in-service training on multiculturalism for professionals working with immigrant parents raising disabled children.

J	Bish, A; Yardley, L; Nicoll, A; Michie, S				Bish, Alison; Yardley, Lucy; Nicoll, Angus; Michie, Susan			Factors associated with uptake of vaccination against pandemic influenza: A systematic review	VACCINE			English	Review						H1N1; Swine flu; Vaccination; Pandemic; Psychological factors	HEALTH-CARE WORKERS; H1N1 INFLUENZA; A/H1N1 VACCINATION; FEAR APPEALS; ATTITUDES; ACCEPTANCE; INTERVENTIONS; DETERMINANTS; METAANALYSIS; BEHAVIORS	Background: In June 2009 a global influenza pandemic was declared by the World Health Organisation. A vaccination programme against H1N1 influenza was introduced in many countries from September 2009, but there was low uptake in both the general population and health professionals in many, though not all, countries. Purpose: To examine the psychological and demographic factors associated with uptake of vaccination during the 2009 pandemic. Method: A systematic literature review searching Web of Science and PubMed databases up to 24 January 2011. Results: 37 articles met the study inclusion criteria. Using the framework of Protection Motivation Theory the review found that both the degree of threat experienced in the 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak and perceptions of vaccination as an effective coping strategy were associated with stronger intentions and higher uptake of vaccination. Appraisal of threat resulted from both believing oneself to be at risk from developing H1N1 influenza and concern and worry about the disease. Appraisal of coping resulted from concerns about the safety of the vaccine and its side effects. There was evidence of an influence of social pressure in that people who thought that others wanted them to be vaccinated were more likely to do so and people getting their information about vaccination from official health sources being more likely to be vaccinated than those relying on unofficial sources. There was also a strong influence of past behaviour, with those having been vaccinated in the past against seasonal influenza being more likely to be vaccinated against pandemic influenza. Demographic factors associated with higher intentions and uptake of vaccination were: older age, male gender, being from an ethnic minority and, for health professionals, being a doctor. Discussion: Interventions designed to increase vaccination rates could be developed and implemented in advance of a pandemic. Strategies to improve uptake of vaccination include interventions which highlight the risk posed by pandemic influenza while simultaneously offering tactics to ameliorate this risk (e.g. vaccination). Perceived concerns about vaccination can be tackled by reducing the omission bias (a perception that harm caused by action is worse than harm caused by inaction). In addition, interventions to increase seasonal influenza vaccination in advance of a future pandemic may be an effective strategy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Task relevance modulates the behavioural and neural effects of sensory predictions	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							TEMPORAL PREDICTION; MOTOR CORTEX; ATTENTION; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; BETA; SYNCHRONIZATION; EXPECTATION; RESPONSES; ERRORS	The brain is thought to generate internal predictions to optimize behaviour. However, it is unclear whether predictions signalling is an automatic brain function or depends on task demands. Here, we manipulated the spatial/temporal predictability of visual targets, and the relevance of spatial/temporal information provided by auditory cues. We used magnetoen-cephalography (MEG) to measure participants' brain activity during task performance. Task relevance modulated the influence of predictions on behaviour: spatial/temporal predictability improved spatial/temporal discrimination accuracy, but not vice versa. To explain these effects, we used behavioural responses to estimate subjective predictions under an ideal-observer model. Model-based time-series of predictions and prediction errors (PEs) were associated with dissociable neural responses: predictions correlated with cue-induced beta-band activity in auditory regions and alpha-band activity in visual regions, while stimulus-bound PEs correlated with gamma-band activity in posterior regions. Crucially, task relevance modulated these spectral correlates, suggesting that current goals influence PE and prediction signalling.

Usually, in three-dimensional (3D) radiation therapy, we need to define the clinical target volume (CTV), which identifies the areas suspected of containing microscopic metastasis. We can use a set of computed tomographic (CT) images to define these suspected areas, which we relate to nodal station distributions. The traditional method uses special anatomic landmarks for such definition. This lymph node image guidance method uses a set of CT images to show the relevant nodal stations and find the correlation between the suspected areas and the lymphatic pathways. First, we used CT images from head and neck cancer patients. Then, we designed a program to delineate the regional lymphatic areas in order to distinguish the position of all the major lymph nodes in the head and neck region. These lymph nodes were then used to assist the oncologist in developing treatment references.

J	Wang, AM				Wang, Aimin			An investigation of key precursors of megaproject crises	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Public megaproject; Key crisis precursors; Proactive crisis management	CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE; MANAGEMENT; GOVERNANCE; SUCCESS; COMPLEXITY; PRINCIPLES; POLITICS; LESSONS	Purpose Detecting precursory signals is critical to increasing the resilience of megaprojects to crises. This study aims to investigate key crisis precursors to better apprehend traces of megaproject crises and proactively respond to approaching crises, thereby increasing project resilience. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the theory of weak signals, 25 potential precursors of megaproject crises are extracted. Using exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM), four models were tested to identify key crisis precursors based on a questionnaire survey of 168 megaproject participants in China. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to examine the differences in participants' perceptions of key crisis precursors. Findings Four key crisis precursors were identified: Imbalance of Benefits and Costs, Irresponsible and Unqualified Key Participants, Regulatory Mechanisms Lacking Transparency and Flexibility, and Information Uncertainty and Asymmetry. Compared with senior executives, team members think that key crisis precursors related to regulatory mechanisms and key participants are more likely to trigger crises, which affects responsive actions toward detected crisis precursors. The findings help identify problems at an early stage and enable timely intervention to mitigate crises. Research limitations/implications Detection of key crisis precursors allows for proactive and targeted actions to mitigate crises. Megaproject development is affected by institutional mechanisms. The influence of institutions on the effectiveness of crisis management needs further investigation. Originality/value Limited attention has been paid to recognizing precursors of megaproject crises. This study identifies four key crisis precursors by uncovering the interrelationships among potential precursors, which enables rapid adaptation to future crises.

Modified Hierarchical-Attention Network model for legal judgment predictions	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Legal judgement prediction; Modified Hierarchical Attention Network (M-HAN); Sentiment polarity feature; Hybrid classifier; BI-LSTM; Self-Improved Recurrent Neural Network (SI-RNN)		The impact of Artificial Intelligence in Legal Research has reached a high level in simulating human thought processes. Case Pendency is a long-lasting problem in many countries. The judicial system has to be more competent and reliable to provide justice on time for any developing country. Litigants and attorneys devote more time and effort to trial case preparation in the courtroom. The task of decision prediction is to automatically forecast the type of charge, law article, and term of punishment. Most of the earlier works for verdict prediction focused to work on civil law jurisdictions. Some of the challenges in the task are case facts are highly unstructured lengthy documents with a lack of annotations and mainly used machine learning techniques. While most research works ignore the information loss at the encoding stage, our proposed MHAN overcomes the above issue and long-range dependency problem using the attention model over hierarchical encoders with three tiers namely Sentence encoder, word encoder, and character encoder. To avoid information loss, a brand-new judgment prediction framework called MHAN is developed in this study effort. It is built on a modified Hierarchical-Attention network and a specially designed domain-specific word embedding model. Additionally, it emphasizes the feature extraction phase by joining features obtained using MHAN with an improved cosine similarity feature. Finally, a hybrid Self Improved RNN is employed to provide the projected results. Furthermore, the proposed model is trained on 10 types of real-time criminal cases from the Madras High Court of India and Supreme Court of India. It has outperformed prior methods in terms of verdict prediction. By applying different variations of the deep learning model and ablation tests, the proposed model achieves consistent results over baseline models.

Differential effects of magnetic pulses on the orientation of naturally migrating birds	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE			English	Article						magnetite; polarity; migration; bird navigation; magnetic field	COMPASS ORIENTATION; NAVIGATIONAL ABILITIES; TRIGEMINAL MEDIATION; MAGNETORECEPTION; FIELD; LIGHT; INFORMATION; SYSTEMS; CRYPTOCHROME; WAVELENGTH	In migratory passerine birds, strong magnetic pulses are thought to be diagnostic of the remagnetization of iron minerals in a putative sensory system contained in the beak. Previous evidence suggests that while such a magnetic pulse affects the orientation of migratory birds in orientation cages, no effect was present when pulse-treated birds were tested in natural migration. Here we show that two migrating passerine birds treated with a strong magnetic pulse, designed to alter the magnetic sense, migrated in a direction that differed significantly from that of controls when tested in natural conditions. The orientation of treated birds was different depending on the alignment of the pulse with respect to the magnetic field. These results can aid in advancing understanding of how the putative iron-mineral-based receptors found in birds' beaks may be used to detect and signal the intensity and/or direction of the Earth's magnetic field.

Ecological uncertainty shapes neophobic predator avoidance in Trinidadian guppies	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Antipredator defence; Neophobia; Phenotypic plasticity; Behavioural trade-offs; Trinidadian guppies	COGNITIVE ECOLOGY; RISK; INFORMATION; BEHAVIOR; RECOGNITION; RETENTION; DECISIONS; ANIMALS; STRESS; CUES	Neophobic predator avoidance (NPA), the fear response exhibited by prey animals exposed to novel stimuli, is a plastic trait thought to be induced by exposure to elevated chronic risk of predation. Indeed, prey experiencing low levels of background risk fail to display NPA, while those experiencing high background risk do display NPA. Recent work has suggested that the trigger for inducing and maintaining NPA may not be background risk per se but rather uncertainty in the predation environment. Here, we designed two experiments on wild-caught neophobic Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to test the uncertainty hypothesis'. In the first experiment, we tested if the diversity of novel stimuli encountered by guppies would affect the maintenance of their NPA. We found that exposure to a single novel odour once per day for 3days was sufficient to extinguish the neophobic response to that odour (Experiment 1A) but not a new odour (Experiment 1B). However, when guppies were exposed to multiple novel odours so that each odour was encountered once a day for 3days, they retained their NPA to both a previously encountered novel odour (Experiment 1A) and a new odour (Experiment 1B). In our second experiment, we repeatedly exposed guppies to a novel cue in a spatially predictable vs. unpredictable location and found that spatial unpredictability interfered with the reduction of NPA to that cue. Combined, our results suggest that uncertainty of risk experienced by prey in time and space shapes the retention of NPA.Significance statementWhen prey face uncertainty, or lack of complete information, about risk in their environment, they engage in adaptive antipredator behaviours such as neophobic predator avoidance. Showing a fear response to a novel stimulus in a high-risk environment is likely adaptive if we assume that most species in that environment are threats. Here, we aim to show how uncertainty, as opposed to simply background levels of risk, may influence the maintenance of neophobic responses in prey. On the basis of two experiments, we showed that prey experiencing increased uncertainty, via increased diversity and spatial unpredictability of novel cues, maintain their neophobic responses more so than prey experiencing lower uncertainty. Understanding the effects of ecological uncertainty on prey behaviour, particularly neophobia, will shed light on how prey might respond as uncertainty increases with climate change, invasive species and anthropogenic habitat modification.

Although each approach has had its successes, recent advances have favored discriminative methods, most notably the convolutional neural network. Still, there is some doubt about whether this approach will scale to a human-level performance given the numbers of samples that are needed to train state-of-the-art systems. Here, we focus on the generative or Bayesian approach, which is more model based and, in theory, more efficient. Challenges include latent-variable modeling, computationally efficient inference, and data modeling. We restrict ourselves to the problem of data modeling, which is possibly the most daunting, and specifically to the generative modeling of image patches. We formulate a new approach, which can be broadly characterized as an application of "conditional modeling," designed to sidestep the high-dimensionality and complexity of image data. A series of experiments, learning appearance models for faces and parts of faces, illustrates the flexibility and effectiveness of the approach.

J	Li, C; Cai, L; Wang, S; Liu, BJ; Cui, HQ; Wei, B				Li Cheng; Cai Li; Wang Sen; Liu Bao-Jun; Cui Huan-Qing; Wei Bo			Switching characteristics of all-spin logic devices based on graphene interconnects	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						all spin logic device; graphene; interconnection dimension; switching characteristics	TRANSFER TORQUE; DESIGN	Traditional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology has reached nanoscale and its physical limits are determined by atomic theory and quantum mechanics, which results in a series of problems such as deteriorated device reliability, large circuit interconnection delay, and huge static power dissipation. In the past decades, with the discovery of giant magnetoresistance effect and tunnel magnetoresistance effect, spintronics has become a research hotspot in this field. Specially, spin transfer torque effect has been experimentally verified that the magnetization of a ferromagnet layer can be manipulated using spin polarized current rather than an external magnetic field. Spintronics is a new type of electronics which utilizes spin rather than charge as state variable for electrical information processing and storage. As an example, all spin logic (ASL) devices, which stores information by using the magnetization direction of the nanomagnet and communication by using spin current, is generally thought to be a good post-CMOS candidate. Compared with the typical metal material, the graphene material has a large conductivity, long spin relaxation time, and weak spin-orbit interaction. Therefore, the dissipation of spin current in the graphene material is weaker than the counterpart in typical metal when the injected current is identical. In this paper, the switching characteristics of all spin logic device comprised of graphene interconnects are analyzed by using the coupled spin transport and magneto-dynamics model. The results show that comparing with ASL device comprised of copper interconnects, the magnetic moment reversal time of ASL with graphene interconnection is short and the spin current flows into the output magnet is large under the condition of same applied voltage and device size. Meanwhile, the switching delay and the energy dissipation are lower when the interconnects are shorter and narrower. When the critical switching current which is required for the magnetization reversal is applied, the reliable working length of graphene interconnection is significantly longer than that of copper interconnection. So the graphene is the more ideal interconnect material than metal material. Moreover, the switching delay and power dissipation could be further reduced by properly selecting the interconnection dimension. These results mentioned above provide guidelines for the optimization and applications of ASL devices.

Public Baseline and shared response structures support the theory of antibody repertoire functional commonality	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article								Author summary It is commonly thought that most people's adaptive immune systems can recognise the same endemic pathogens, many of which invade our bodies daily. However, existing methods of antibody repertoire comparison (which focus on genetic relatedness) only predict a tiny number of functionally equivalent antibodies in the resting state repertoires of different individuals. Here, we propose a novel approach that predicts the structural diversity of antibody binding sites within a repertoire sequence dataset. This orthogonal methodology can be applied to pool together antibodies from different genetic lineages with topological potential to bind to the same pathogen surface, and that may be functionally equivalent if they share a sufficiently similar surface interaction profile. Our methodology finds that a much greater than random set of binding site geometries exist across resting-state repertoires and can detect binding site geometric convergence in response to vaccination, both of which are consistent with underlying functional commonality between individuals. We further show that knowledge of these geometries could be useful in therapeutic antibody drug discovery, through rational screening library design. Different repertoire sequencing datasets could be interrogated to achieve a more general set of topologies compatible with many pathogens or a tailored set bespoke to a single pathogen. The naA over bar ve antibody/B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires of different individuals ought to exhibit significant functional commonality, given that most pathogens trigger an effective antibody response to immunodominant epitopes. Sequence-based repertoire analysis has so far offered little evidence for this phenomenon. For example, a recent study estimated the number of shared ('public') antibody clonotypes in circulating baseline repertoires to be around 0.02% across ten unrelated individuals. However, to engage the same epitope, antibodies only require a similar binding site structure and the presence of key paratope interactions, which can occur even when their sequences are dissimilar. Here, we search for evidence of geometric similarity/convergence across human antibody repertoires. We first structurally profile naA over bar ve ('baseline') antibody diversity using snapshots from 41 unrelated individuals, predicting all modellable distinct structures within each repertoire. This analysis uncovers a high (much greater than random) degree of structural commonality. For instance, around 3% of distinct structures are common to the ten most diverse individual samples ('Public Baseline' structures). Our approach is the first computational method to find levels of BCR commonality commensurate with epitope immunodominance and could therefore be harnessed to find more genetically distant antibodies with same-epitope complementarity. We then apply the same structural profiling approach to repertoire snapshots from three individuals before and after flu vaccination, detecting a convergent structural drift indicative of recognising similar epitopes ('Public Response' structures). We show that Antibody Model Libraries derived from Public Baseline and Public Response structures represent a powerful geometric basis set of low-immunogenicity candidates exploitable for general or target-focused therapeutic antibody screening.

J	Smart, PR				Smart, Paul R.			Mandevillian intelligence	SYNTHESE			English	Article						Collective cognition; Group cognition; Collective intelligence; Social simulation; Social epistemology; Cognitive technology	INFORMATION; MEMORY; RATIONALITY; EXPLORATION; CHARACTER; DYNAMICS; NETWORK	Mandevillian intelligence is a specific form of collective intelligence in which individual cognitive vices (i.e., shortcomings, limitations, constraints and biases) are seen to play a positive functional role in yielding collective forms of cognitive success. The present paper introduces the concept of mandevillian intelligence and reviews a number of strands of empirical research that help to shed light on the phenomenon. The paper also attempts to highlight the value of the concept of mandevillian intelligence from a philosophical, scientific and engineering perspective. Inasmuch as we accept the notion of mandevillian intelligence, then it seems that the cognitive and epistemic value of a specific social or technological intervention will vary according to whether our attention is focused at the individual or collective level of analysis. This has a number of important implications for how we think about the design and evaluation of collective cognitive systems. For example, the notion of mandevillian intelligence forces us to take seriously the idea that the exploitation (or even the accentuation) of individual cognitive shortcomings could, in some situations, provide a productive route to collective forms of cognitive and epistemic success.

J	Pilkington, E; Sage, K; Saddy, D; Robson, H				Pilkington, Emma; Sage, Karen; Saddy, Douglas; Robson, Holly			When does lexical availability influence phonology? Evidence from Jargon reading and repetition	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Nonwords; perseveration; POI; lexical processing; auditory repetition; reading aloud	VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; VERBAL PERSEVERATION; AUDITORY REPETITION; SEMANTIC DEMENTIA; WERNICKES APHASIA; SPEECH PRODUCTION; DUAL-ROUTE; FREQUENCY; ERRORS	Jargon aphasia is a language disorder characterised by phonological and nonword error. Errors are thought to arise when target segments are insufficiently activated, allowing non-target or recently used phonology to intrude. Words which are more frequent and familiar reside with greater degrees of activation and therefore should be less susceptible to error. The current study tested this hypothesis in a group of 10 people with Jargon aphasia using single word repetition and reading aloud. Each task had two lexicality conditions, one high and one low lexical availability word set. Measures of nonword quantity, phonological accuracy and perseveration were used in group and case series analyses. Results demonstrated that fewer nonwords were produced when lexical availability was greater. However, lexicality effects on phonological accuracy and perseveration were only observed in repetition in a sub-group of moderately impaired individuals, demonstrating that lexical information does not consistently influence phonological processing in Jargon aphasia.

To take measures against prevalence of childhood asthma, many researchers have surveyed the actual statuses of childhood asthma in developed countries, but in most Asia-Pacific developing countries including Mongolia such surveys have never been sufficiently conducted until now. We have thought that this survey, though performed in 2009, will give important and meaningful information even now in taking measures to prevent prevailing bronchial asthma in children in Mongolia or the countries under similar statuses. Methods: The asthma prevalence and patient background information in Mongolian children aged 6-7 living in Ulaanbaatar were examined using a written questionnaire modified for their parents from that prepared by the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). Results: The estimated prevalence of asthma in Mongolian children was 20.9%. The following 3 risk factors were found to be related to asthma: (1) having allergic rhinitis symptoms, (2) mothers' smoking, and (3) history of severe respiratory infection before 1-year-old. Conclusions: The asthma prevalence in Mongolian children was higher than that in the world and Asia-Pacific countries reported by ISAAC. The higher prevalence was probably attributable to households' (especially mothers) smoking in draft-free houses designed for the cold area and severe air-pollution due to rapid industrialization and urbanization in Mongolia. Smoking prohibition in the mother (including family members) and a reduction of exposure to air pollutants are urgently needed to prevent developing childhood asthma.

Analysis of Human Grasping Behavior: Correlating Tasks, Objects and Grasps	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HAPTICS			English	Article						Human grasping; manipulation; activities of daily living; prosthetics; robotic hands	INDEX; ADL	This paper is the second in a two-part series analyzing human grasping behavior during a wide range of unstructured tasks. It investigates the tasks performed during the daily work of two housekeepers and two machinists and correlates grasp type and object properties with the attributes of the tasks being performed. The task or activity is classified according to the force required, the degrees of freedom, and the functional task type. We found that 46 percent of tasks are constrained, where the manipulated object is not allowed to move in a full six degrees of freedom. Analyzing the interrelationships between the grasp, object, and task data show that the best predictors of the grasp type are object size, task constraints, and object mass. Using these attributes, the grasp type can be predicted with 47 percent accuracy. Those parameters likely make useful heuristics for grasp planning systems. The results further suggest the common sub-categorization of grasps into power, intermediate, and precision categories may not be appropriate, indicating that grasps are generally more multi-functional than previously thought. We find large and heavy objects are grasped with a power grasp, but small and lightweight objects are not necessarily grasped with precision grasps-even with grasped object size less than 2 cm and mass less than 20 g, precision grasps are only used 61 percent of the time. These results have important implications for robotic hand design and grasp planners, since it appears while power grasps are frequently used for heavy objects, they can still be quite practical for small, lightweight objects.

J	Grubert, E				Grubert, Emily			The Need for a Preference-Based Multicriteria Prioritization Framework in Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						decision support; environmental values; industrial ecology; life cycle assessment (LCA); sensitivity analysis; weighting	ENVIRONMENTAL DECISION-MAKING; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; RISK-ASSESSMENT; NORMALIZATION; SYSTEMS; MITIGATION; VALUATION; BENEFITS; DATABASE; SUPPORT	Life cycle thinking is a valuable tool for integrated assessment of the environmental, social, and economic outcomes of human activities. The combination of the three as life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) is a powerful decision support tool, but it also presents important design challenges. Among the most important challenges is how to include subjective information necessary for defining the major elements of a decision: prospects to decide among, uncertainty, risk attitudes, and preferences. Previous work on values in life cycle methods has addressed prospects, uncertainty, and risk attitudes. This article builds on that work by arguing that given LCSA's broad scope, explicit and standardized intercategory preferences are especially important for improving its value for decision makers. Practitioners should not be solely responsible for the value judgments necessary to integrate impact categories within and across environmental life cycle assessment (E-LCA), social LCA (S-LCA), and life cycle costing evaluations for LCSA. Neither should this task fall entirely to decision makers, particularly as life cycle-grounded decisions are highly sensitive to value frames. Individuals are unlikely to be able to meaningfully interpret, evaluate, and determine trade-offs without support. This article thus proposes that LCSA leverage its multiple paradigms to rigorously generate explicit, empirically grounded intercategory preference archetypes for use in evaluating decision robustness, much as cultural theory-based archetypes are currently used to test robustness to risk attitudes. Proof-of-concept data from the United States illustrate this approach, named WELFARES.

This study examined the effectiveness of a handwriting program for early non-proficient writers which integrated instruction of factual, procedural, and spatial information to develop orthographic knowledge of alphabet-letters, for the purpose of mastering alphabet-letter writing skills. A non-concurrent ABA single system research design was employed. The A phases represented in-class handwriting instruction and the B phase was the experimental intervention. Participants were ten children in their first two years of formal schooling, identified by their teacher as having difficulty with handwriting. The repeated outcome measure was the Perceive, Recall, Plan and Perform System of Task Analysis (Stage One). Results indicated that changes to accuracy of letter-formation achieved during the experimental intervention, were significantly greater than during the initial baseline condition. All ten children displayed a similar pattern of results and achieved, on average, independence in writing the twenty-six-lowercase alphabet-letters from memory within six-weeks (nine hours) of intervention. Independence in writing alphabet-letters from memory was maintained when intervention was withdrawn. The study provided preliminary evidence that establishment of memory structures for the acquisition of orthographic knowledge of alphabet-letters, improves alphabet-letter-writing of children who previously struggled.

Corticomotor output is reduced in response to acute muscle pain, yet the mechanisms that underpin this effect remain unclear. Here the authors investigate the effect of acute muscle pain on short-latency afferent inhibition, long-latency afferent inhibition, and long-interval intra-cortical inhibition to determine whether these mechanisms could plausibly contribute to reduced motor output in pain. Design. Observational same subject pre-post test design. Setting. Neurophysiology research laboratory. Subjects. Healthy, right-handed human volunteers (n = 22, 9 male; mean age +/- standard deviation, 22.6 +/- 7.8 years). Methods. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess corticomotor output, short-latency afferent inhibition, long-latency afferent inhibition, and long-interval intra-cortical inhibition before, during, immediately after, and 15 minutes after hypertonic saline infusion into right first dorsal interosseous muscle. Pain intensity and quality were recorded using an 11-point numerical rating scale and the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Results. Compared with baseline, corticomotor output was reduced at all time points (p = 0.001). Short-latency afferent inhibition was reduced immediately after (p = 0.039), and long-latency afferent inhibition 15 minutes after (p = 0.035), the resolution of pain. Long-interval intra-cortical inhibition was unchanged at any time point (p = 0.36). Conclusions. These findings suggest short- and long-latency afferent inhibition, mechanisms thought to reflect the integration of sensory information with motor output at the cortex, are reduced following acute muscle pain. Although the functional relevance is unclear, the authors hypothesize a reduction in these mechanisms may contribute to the restoration of normal motor output after an episode of acute muscle pain.

TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Automated vehicle; Human-machine shared control; Traffic crash; Responsibility judgment; Sequential mixed -methods	AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; EXPERIMENTAL VIGNETTE; ATTRIBUTION; PSYCHOLOGY; ACCIDENTS; VIGILANCE; LIABILITY; CARS	The advent of automated and algorithmic technology requires people to consider them when assigning responsibility for something going wrong. We focus on a focal question: who or what should be responsible when both human and machine drivers make mistakes in human-machine shared-control vehicles? We examined human judgments of responsibility for automated vehicle (AV) crashes (e.g., the 2018 Uber AV crash) caused by the distracted test driver and malfunctioning automated driving system, through a sequential mixed-methods design: a text analysis of public comments after the first trial of the Uber case (Study 1) and vignette-based experiment (Study 2). Studies 1 and 2 found that although people assigned more responsibility to the test driver than the car manufacturer, the car manufacturer is not clear of responsibility from their perspective, which is against the Uber case's jury decision that the test driver was the only one facing criminal charges. Participants allocated equal responsibility to the normal driver and car manufacturer in Study 2. In Study 1, people gave different and sometimes antagonistic reasons for their judgments. Some commented that human drivers in AVs will inevitably feel bored and reduce vigilance and attention when the automated driving system is operating (called "passive error"), whereas others thought the test driver can keep attentive and should not be distracted (called "active error"). Study 2's manipulation of passive and active errors, however, did not influence responsibility judgments significantly. Our results might offer insights for building a socially-acceptable framework for responsibility judgments for AV crashes.

J	Li, AL; Tian, DX; Zhao, ZB				Li, Anlin; Tian, Dongxu; Zhao, Zhibing			DFT studies on the reaction mechanism for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes by BN catalysts	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							BORON-CONTAINING CATALYSTS; OXIDE CATALYSTS; NITRIDE; PROPANE; ETHANE; OLEFINS	The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction mechanism of ethane and propane catalyzed by two kinds of oxygen-species-terminated BN materials, namely BN nanotubes and h-BN, was studied by the B3LYP-D3 functional with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. On the atomic-oxygen-species-terminated active sites, two hydrogen atoms of the alkane were abstracted to form an alkene in a concerted way, which was more favourable than the stepwise mechanism from kinetic and thermodynamic viewpoints. The concerted way could lead to excellent selectivity to alkenes because without intermediate to side-product. The steric structural match between the alkane and oxygen species was thought to be the major effect factor to determine the ODH mechanism. Active oxygen species were recovered through the hydroxyl coupling into water with an activation energy (238.17 kJ mol(-1)) close to experimental data (253 kJ mol(-1)). By investigating the transformation kinetics from hydroxyl-terminated species to active-oxygen-terminated species, the active-site regeneration was speculated to be the rate-limiting step of ODH. Stepwise oxidative dehydrogenation happening in a rebound mechanism could explain the formation of CO(x)side-product, although its activation energy was much larger than that for the concerted way.

Infants' gaze exhibits a fractal structure that varies by age and stimulus salience	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; FLUCTUATIONS; PERCEPTION; PHYSIOLOGY	The development of selective visual attention is critical for effectively engaging with an ever-changing world. Its optimal deployment depends upon interactions between neural, motor, and sensory systems across multiple timescales and neurocognitive loci. Previous work illustrates the spatio-temporal dynamics of these processes in adults, but less is known about this emergent phenomenon early in life. Using data (n=190; 421 visits) collected between 3 and 35 months of age, we examined the spatio-temporal complexity of young children's gaze patterns as they viewed stimuli varying in semantic salience. Specifically, we used detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to quantify the extent to which infants' gaze patterns exhibited scale invariant patterns of nested variability, an organizational feature thought to reflect self-organized and optimally flexible system dynamics that are not overly rigid or random. Results indicated that gaze patterns of even the youngest infants exhibited fractal organization that increased with age. Further, fractal organization was greater when children (a) viewed social stimuli compared to stimuli with degraded social information and (b) when they spontaneously gazed at faces. These findings suggest that selective attention is well-organized in infancy, particularly toward social information, and indicate noteworthy growth in these processes across the first years of life.

End-of-Life Preferences: A Randomized Trial of Framing Comfort Care as Refusal of Treatment in the Context of COVID-19	MEDICAL DECISION MAKING			English	Article						advance directive; COVID-19; nudge; behavioral economics; defaults; framing; priming	ADVANCE DIRECTIVES; CANCER-PATIENTS; ATTITUDES; DOCTORS; NURSES; IF	Background Rates of advance directive (AD) completion in the United Kingdom are lower than in the United States and other western European countries, which is especially concerning in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. UK residents typically complete an advance decision to refuse care (ADRT), whereas US versions of ADs present a more neutral choice between comfort-oriented or life-prolonging care. The purpose of this study is to test whether this framing affects decision making for end-of-life care and if this is affected by exposure to information about the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In an online experiment, 801 UK-based respondents were randomly allocated to document their preferences for end-of-life care in a 2 (US AD or UK ADRT) by 2 (presence or absence of COVID-19 prime) between-subjects factorial design. Results Most (74.8%) of participants across all conditions chose comfort-oriented care. However, framing comfort care as a refusal of treatment made respondents significantly less likely to choose it (65.4% v. 84.1%, P < 0.001). This effect was exacerbated by priming participants to think about COVID-19: those completing an ADRT were significantly more likely to choose life-prolonging care when exposed to the COVID-19 prime (39.8% v. 29.6%, P = 0.032). Subgroup analyses revealed these effects differed by age, with older participants' choices influenced more by COVID-19 while younger participants were more affected by the AD framing. Conclusions The UK ADRT significantly reduced the proportion of participants choosing comfort-oriented care, an effect that was heightened in the presence of information about COVID-19. This suggests the current way end-of-life care wishes are documented in the United Kingdom could affect people's choices in a way that does not align with their preferences, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A mixed-methods approach, utilizing a combination of think-aloud analysis, personal interviews, and surveys, was adopted for user acceptance and usability testing among a group of breast cancer survivors. User feedback was gathered on their perceived value of the application, and any user-interface issues that may hinder the overall usability were identified. The application's portability and capability of organizing their entire breast cancer-related medical history as well as tracking various quality of life indicators were perceived to be valuable features. The application had an overall high usability; however, certain sections of the application were not as intuitive to locate. Visual elements of the website were appreciated; however, overall experience would benefit from incorporating more sociable elements that exhibit positive re-enforcement within the end user and provide a friendlier experience. The results of the study showcase the need for more personalized tools and resources to support survivors in self-management. It also demonstrates the ability to integrate breast cancer survivorship care plans from diverse providers and paves the way to add further value-added features in consumer health applications, such as personal decision support. Using a personal decision support-based tool can serve as a training tool and resource, providing these patients with pertinent information about the various aspects of their long-term health, while educating them about any related side effects and symptoms. It is hoped that making such tools more accessible could help in engaging survivors to play an active role in managing their health and encourage shared decision-making with their providers.

In modern clinical practice, the implantation procedure of the electrode arrays remains traumatic for patients and increases postoperative infection risk. Here we report a design and insertion technique of thermally activated shape-memory polymer-based electrode array that can recover up to ten times length deformation. The compressed four-centimeter wide array can be easily packed into a three-millimeter diameter tube and subsequently deployed thought five-millimeter opening in a restricted space between a brain phantom and a simulated skull. The mechanical properties of the developed array are comparable to the materials traditionally employed for the purpose, and the electrical and signal recording properties are preserved after shape deformation and recovery. Additionally, the array is biocompatible and exhibits conformability to a curvy brain surface. The results demonstrate that insertion of the electrode array through a small hole into a restricted space similar to subdural cavity is possible, which may inspire future solution of minimal invasive implantation for patients suffering from epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or tetraplegia.

J	Todd, J; Provost, A; Cooper, G				Todd, Juanita; Provost, Alexander; Cooper, Gavin			Lasting first impressions: A conservative bias in automatic filters of the acoustic environment	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Mismatch negativity (MMN); Prediction-error; Auditory memory; Salience; Latent inhibition	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; RESPONSES	Even in the unattended auditory environment, what we learn first appears resistant to re-evaluation based on experience. Mismatch negativity (MMN) is an auditory event-related potential elicited to rare deviation from automatically generated predictions about the sound environment. MMN amplitude is thought to reflect the potential importance of a sound for further processing. This study was designed to explore the degree to which past experience with a sound can alter automatic attributions about that sound's importance. MMN was elicited to rare (p = .125) physical "deviants" amongst a sequence of highly probable (p = .875) "standard" sounds. Sound identity alternated across blocks within the sequence (i.e., the former deviant became the new standard and the former standard the new deviant). The time period over which a standard remained the more probable tone was varied over Fast (0.8 min), Medium (1.6 min) and Slow (2.4 min) change conditions. Given that local within-block probabilities remained constant across conditions, any change in MMN size was considered a reflection of more rostral brain regions enabling a longer time scale (across-block) representation of event-probability extraction. Larger MMNs were expected to deviations in blocks with longer standard-stability. Although a significant increase in MMN amplitude was observed with increased rule stability, MMN amplitude was heavily dependent on the initial sequence structure. A "primacy bias" was observed such that prolonged stability produced large increases in the MMN to deviations from the first established standard but substantially smaller MMN to this first standard as a later deviant. The primacy effect in these data implies that the automatic filtering of sound relevance is biased toward a confirmation of initial expectations. Initial experience therefore altered the perceived salience of subsequent events. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Consistent with this notion, excitation-inhibition imbalances are considered a pathophysiological mechanism in many brain disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, methods to measure E/I ratios in human brain networks are lacking. Here, we present a method to quantify a functional E/I ratio (fE/I) from neuronal oscillations, and validate it in healthy subjects and children with ASD. We define structural E/I ratio in an in silico neuronal network, investigate how it relates to power and long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of the network's activity, and use these relationships to design the fE/I algorithm. Application of this algorithm to the EEGs of healthy adults showed that fE/I is balanced at the population level and is decreased through GABAergic enforcement. In children with ASD, we observed larger fE/I variability and stronger LRTC compared to typically developing children (TDC). Interestingly, visual grading for EEG abnormalities that are thought to reflect E/I imbalances revealed elevated fE/I and LRTC in ASD children with normal EEG compared to TDC or ASD with abnormal EEG. We speculate that our approach will help understand physiological heterogeneity also in other brain disorders.

The analysis outputs were assessed, along with the participants' questionnaire and focus group responses pertaining to their experiences of using the method. When combining the mixed methods data generated during the study, a number of observations regarding the participants' experiences of using STAMP were made. However, improving the method's usability and graphical output were highlighted as key developments that may improve its acceptance by practitioners. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, many types of geographic knowledge are statistical in nature and are therefore difficult to derive rules that are meaningful for this purpose. The rules of continuity and symmetry considered in this paper can be thought of as two concrete forms of the first law of geography, which may be used to formulate quality measures at the individual level without referring to ground truth. It is not clear, however, how much the rules can be faithful. Hence, the main objective is to test if the rules are consistent with street network data over the world. Specifically, for the rule of continuity we identify natural streets that connect smoothly in a network, and measure the spatial order of information (e.g. names, highway level, speed, etc.) along the streets. The measure is based on spatial auto-correlation indicators adapted for one dimension. For the rule of symmetry, we device an algorithm that recognize parallel road pairs (e.g. dual carriageways), and examine to what extent attributes in the pairs are identical. The two rules are tested against 28 cities selected from OpenStreetMap data worldwide; two professional data sets are used to show more insights. We found that the rules are consistent with street networks from a wide range of cities of different characteristics, and also noted cases with varying degrees of agreement. As a side-effect, we discussed possible limitations of the autocorrelation indicators used, where cautions are needed when interpreting the results. In addition, we present techniques that performed the tests automatically, which can be applied to new data to further verify (or falsify) our findings, or extended as quality assurance tools to detect data items that do not satisfy the rules and to suggest possible corrections according to the rules.

Design/methodology/approach - The analysis was conducted through Google Forms platform of docs. google interviews with a sample of 705 consumers who were given a questionnaire to collect information about their economic status and their attitudes toward milk and special milk consumption. Findings - The results were analyzed in order to identify the socio-economic and behavioral characteristics of homogeneous groups of consumers. They consume milk mainly because it is not expensive and it is possible to easily buy it in the supermarket. They consume special milk mainly because of food allergies or intolerances. They would like to buy special milk at large-scale retail trade outlets; they underline difficulties in finding and purchasing it. They think that the price of special milk is very high. Originality/value - The results showed that those who occasionally consume special milk choose it because it is more nourishing or for health reasons; there is also a significant association between the judgment on prices of special milk and the frequency of purchase. The estimation of a generalized linear model allowed to highlight that only age and the presence of health problems/intolerances are significant predictors of special milk consumption.

Exploring consumer value of multi-channel shopping: a perspective of means-end theory	INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						Online shopping; Consumer value; Multi-channel shopping; Means-end theory; Hierarchical value map; Consumer behaviour; Retailing; Taiwan	CUSTOMER VALUE; BEHAVIOR; CONSUMPTION; PRODUCT; TECHNOLOGY; ATTITUDES; BENEFITS; QUALITY; CONTEXT; CHAIN	Purpose - With advances in information technology, multi-channel shopping (MCS) has become a prevailing purchasing pattern today. Although MCS provides more benefits than single-channel shopping, there is a need to investigate consumer values in the MCS context. This study aims to develop a consumer value hierarchy that represents how consumers think and pursue when performing MCS. Design/methodology/approach - The research framework was developed from a perspective of means-end theory. Two studies were designed to elicit and evaluate a consumer value hierarchy of MCS. First, a qualitative study was conducted to explore means-end elements of MCS. Then, a hierarchical value map of MCS was constructed with 314 usable responses from an empirical survey in Taiwan. The impacts of past shopping experience on consumers' value perceptions were also examined. Findings - In the hierarchical value map (HVM) of MCS, the results indicate 18 means-end chains from ten MCS attributes resulting in nine consequences derived from those attributes, and then to four MCS values. The results also show that both expert and novice shoppers emphasize the utilitarian value of MCS; however, shopping novices pay more attention to the hedonic value of MCS than experts do. Practical implications - This paper provides several managerial implications for multi-channel retailers. Multi-channel retailers need to know more about the attributes and functions of each channel that they offer in order to create a superior shopping experience for their customers. Also, retailers need to understand different MCS patterns for successful multi-channel customer relationship management. Finally, the consumer value hierarchy of MCS is a useful tool for retailers to develop effective promotion strategies to increase customers' engagement in MCS. Originality/value - This paper is the first to apply means-end theory to investigate consumer value in the MCS context. It advances the consumer value literature in explaining a novel type of consumer channel-mixing behavior. The paper concludes with implications for multi-channel retailers, and future directions for MCS research are also discussed.

Experiential reward learning outweighs instruction prior to adulthood	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Development; Reinforcement learning; Decision-making; Cognitive control	PREDICTION ERRORS; RISK-TAKING; COGNITIVE CONTROL; DECISION-MAKING; DOPAMINE; BEHAVIOR; SUSCEPTIBILITY; INFORMATION; RECRUITMENT; RESISTANCE	Throughout our lives, we face the important task of distinguishing rewarding actions from those that are best avoided. Importantly, there are multiple means by which we acquire this information. Through trial and error, we use experiential feedback to evaluate our actions. We also learn which actions are advantageous through explicit instruction from others. Here, we examined whether the influence of these two forms of learning on choice changes across development by placing instruction and experience in competition in a probabilistic-learning task. Whereas inaccurate instruction markedly biased adults' estimations of a stimulus's value, children and adolescents were better able to objectively estimate stimulus values through experience. Instructional control of learning is thought to recruit prefrontal-striatal brain circuitry, which continues to mature into adulthood. Our behavioral data suggest that this protracted neurocognitive maturation may cause the motivated actions of children and adolescents to be less influenced by explicit instruction than are those of adults. This absence of a confirmation bias in children and adolescents represents a paradoxical developmental advantage of youth over adults in the unbiased evaluation of actions through positive and negative experience.

The application of augmented reality (AR) technology can help to establish a link between virtual and real-world information for students. Studies of applying AR in ACE education have increased annually, and numerous research have indicated that AR possesses immense application potential. To address and analyze pertinent research issues, published studies in the Scopus database were explored, and revealed that problems persist and are worthy of attention, such as the selection of system types and devices, the application of research methods, and appropriate learning strategies and teaching methods. Courses with objective grading standards should be given priority in AR experimental courses for a meticulous investigation of AR influence on students' learning outcomes and ultimately improvement of classroom quality. Suitable types of AR systems should be selected based on course content, prior to the design and development of the system. It is recommended to develop markerless systems for a larger application range to benefit students with additional convenience. Systems can also be accompanied by functions, such as instant online assessments, synchronized assessments, and exchange capabilities to assist learning what has been taught and develop critical thinking abilities. The combination of AR and building information modeling (BIM) in architectural and civil practice, which has immense application potential, has become an emerging research trend. Collaboration between academics and practice should be enhanced with roles and knowledge of instructors, engineers, designers, and computer experts integrated for an optimal connection between general pedagogy and domain-specific learning. Teaching methods that emphasize locations, as well as roles, can be adopted in order to create a superior reality learning environment with diversified learning methods. The trends and research have become an integration and collaboration issue that should be performed interactively with pedagogical findings, and resources integrated across roles, fields, and university departments.

J	Hwang, D; Lee, EJ; Rhee, W				Hwang, Duhun; Lee, Eunjung; Rhee, Wonjong			AID-purifier: A light auxiliary network for boosting adversarial defense	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Adversarial defense; Auxiliary network; Discriminative purifier; Robustness booster	ROBUSTNESS	In this study, we propose AID-purifier that can boost the robustness of adversarially-trained networks by purifying their inputs. AID-purifier is an auxiliary network that works as an add-on to an already trained main classifier. To keep it computationally light, it is trained as a discriminator with a binary cross entropy loss. To obtain additionally useful information from the adversarial examples, the architecture design is closely related to the information maximization principle where two layers of the main classification network are piped into the auxiliary network. To assist the iterative optimization procedure of purification, the auxiliary network is trained with AVmixup. AID-purifier can be also used together with other purifiers such as PixelDefend for an extra enhancement. Because input purification has been studied relative less when compared to adversarial training or gradient masking, we conduct extensive attack experiments to validate AID-purifier's robustness. The overall results indicate that the best performing adversarially-trained networks can be enhanced further with AID-purifier.

This study investigated nonverbal executive functions in adolescence among Taiwanese children with ADHD. Methods: The sample included fifty-three 11- to 16-year-old adolescents (male, 75.5%) with a childhood diagnosis of ADHD according to the DSM-IV criteria, and 53 age-, sex-, IQ-, and parental education-matched comparison adolescents. They were assessed using psychiatric interviews (mothers included), the Weschler intelligence Scale for Children-3rd edition, and the tasks involving the executive functions of the Cambridge neuropsychological test automated battery: the spatial span, spatial working memory, intradimensional/extradimensional shifts, and stocking of Cambridge. A linear multilevel model was used for data analysis for the matched case-control study design and repeated measures within the same participants. Results: Forty-three adolescents (81.1%) had persistent DSM-IV ADHD diagnosis. The ADHD group made more errors in the spatial span and spatial working memory, had more complete stage trials in the intradimensional/extradimensional shifts, and had fewer problems solved and shorter initial and subsequent thinking time in the stockings of Cambridge than the controls. The magnitudes of group differences increased with increased task difficulties. Persistent ADHD and methylphenidate did not make significant difference in executive functions. Conclusions: The findings of the authors suggest that adolescents with childhood ADHD need extra assistance when they are assigned complex tasks regardless of persistence of ADHD at adolescence.

The purpose of the current study was to contribute to the field in this regard by assessing SIN performance in a sample of adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and comparing results with age-matched controls. This population was chosen because core symptoms of ADHD include developmental deficits in cognitive control and working memory capacity and because these top-down processes are thought to reach maturity during adolescence in individuals with typical development. The study utilized natural language sentence materials under experimental conditions that manipulated the dependency on cognitive mechanisms in varying degrees. In addition, participants were tested on cognitive capacity measures of complex working memory-span, selective attention, and lexical access. Primary findings were in support of the ELU-model. Age was shown to significantly covary with SIN performance, and after controlling for age, ADHD participants demonstrated greater difficulty than controls with the experimental manipulations. In addition, overall SIN performance was strongly predicted by individual differences in cognitive capacity. Taken together, the results highlight the general disadvantage persons with deficient cognitive capacity have when attending to speech in typically noisy listening environments. Furthermore, the consistently poorer performance observed in the ADHD group suggests that auditory processing tasks designed to tax attention and working memory capacity may prove to be beneficial clinical instruments when diagnosing ADHD.

Relationships between rhizosphere microbiota and forest health conditions in <i>Pinus pinaster</i> stands at the Iberian Peninsula	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Maritime pine; Forest decline; Metabarcoding; Umbelopsis; Paenibacillus	FUNGAL COMMUNITIES; SOIL; DIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; SEQUENCES; DECLINE; CLIMATE; PROTEOBACTERIA; CONSERVATION; BACTERIA	Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) is a Mediterranean forest tree species of great ecological importance within the European Union and the Iberian Peninsula in particular, whose presence is seriously threatened by forest decline. Knowledge of the diversity, abundance, and functionality of rhizospheric microorganisms can provide important information in the design of new strategies for sustainable forest management against forest decline. In this work, rhizospheric samples were collected from representative pine forests in the region of Castilla y Le ' on (North -western Spain) (in 10 municipalities of 5 different provinces), analyzing different physicochemical parameters and bacterial and fungal biodiversity (by metabarcoding). In addition, different variables of tree health and climatic conditions were analyzed. The main phylum of microorganisms found in the rhizosphere of P. pinaster were the Ascomycota (54.5 %) and Acidobacteria (16.4 %) in fungi and bacteria, respectively. A clear rela-tionship was found between the presence/absence of certain bacterial and fungal groups (taxonomic and func-tional) and the presence/absence of healthy/sick trees. Specifically, the fungal genus Umbelopsis and the bacterial genus Paenibacillus were thought as possible control agents of decline, as their presence was related to the absence of disease. Understanding the relationships between rhizosphere microbiota and forest health param-eters in Pinus pinaster can be only achieved by exploring the complex 'ecosystem microbiome' and its functioning using focused, integrative microbiological and ecological research performed across multiple habitats.

J	Mehta, P; Pandya, S; Kotecha, K				Mehta, Pooja; Pandya, Sharnil; Kotecha, Ketan			Harvesting social media sentiment analysis to enhance stock market prediction using deep learning	PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Stock prediction; Sentiment analysis; Machine learning; Deep learning; LSTM	SYSTEM	Information gathering has become an integral part of assessing people's behaviors and actions. The Internet is used as an online learning site for sharing and exchanging ideas. People can actively give their reviews and recommendations for variety of products and services using popular social sites and personal blogs. Social networking sites, including Twitter, Facebook, and Google+, are examples of the sites used to share opinion. The stock market (SM) is an essential area of the economy and plays a significant role in trade and industry development. Predicting SM movements is a well-known and area of interest to researchers. Social networking perfectly reflects the public's views of current affairs. Financial news stories are thought to have an impact on the return of stock trend prices and many data minin g techniques are used address fluctuations in the SM. Machine learning can provide a more accurate and robust approach to handle SM-related predictions. We sought to identify how movements in a company's stock prices correlate with the expressed opinions (sentiments) of the public about that company. We designed and implemented a stock price prediction accuracy tool considering public sentiment apart from other parameters. The proposed algorithm considers public sentiment, opinions, news and historical stock prices to forecast future stock prices. Our experiments were performed using machine-learning and deep-learning methods including Support Vector Machine, MNB classifier, linear regression, Naive Bayes and Long Short-Term Memory. Our results validate the success of the proposed methodology.

One of the key concepts of SVMs is the usage of a so-called kernel function, which can be thought of as a special similarity measure. In this paper we consider kernels for molecular structures, which are based oil a graph representation of chemical compounds. The similarity score is calculated by computing an optimal assignment of the atoms from one molecule to those of another one, including information on specific chemical properties, membership to a substructure (e.g... aromatic ring, carbonyl group, etc.) and neighborhood for each atom. We show that by using this kernel we can achieve a generalization performance comparable to a classical model with a few descriptors, which are a-priori known to be relevant for the problem, and significantly better results than with and without performing all automatic descriptor selection. For this purpose we investigate ADME classification and regression datasets for predicting bioavailability (Yoshida), Human Intestinal Absorption (HIA), Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB) penetration and a dataset consisting of four different inhibitor classes (SOL). We further explore the effect of combining our kernel with a problem-dependent descriptor set. We also demonstrate the usefulness of an extension of our method to a reduced graph representation of molecules, in which certain structural features, like, e.g., rings, donors or acceptors, are represented as a single node in the molecular graph.

European HANDOVER Res	What can artefact analysis tell us about patient transitions between the hospital and primary care? Lessons from the HANDOVER project	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE			English	Article						patient safety; transitions of care; handovers; cognitive artefacts; artefact analysis	AFTER-DISCHARGE; COMMUNICATION; PHYSICIANS; SAFETY	Background: Hospital discharge often faces breakdowns in information, communication, and coordination. The European Union FP7 Health Research Programme commissioned the European HANDOVER Project in 2008, a three year, 3.5 million Euro programme to examine transitions of patient care from the hospital to the community care settings. Six European countries-Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, United Kingdom, Spain, and Sweden-participated in this collaborative study. Objectives: This paper highlights a multi-centre, multi-national research programme. We describe how HANDOVER participants conducted an 'artefact analysis' as one element of the mixed methods study to inform opportunities to make patient handovers between hospital and community care more effective. Methods: The artefact analysis consisted of a four-step process to assess different tools used in communication and treatment and their effects on the communication processes between the hospital and general practice settings. Results: Four themes emerged from our analysis: (a) The inpatient care of a patient is 'hospital centric' whereby the hospital 'pulls' information regarding a patient's family physician (b) There are rich cognitive artefacts that support the patient clinician encounter; c) The use of information technology does not necessarily improve the communication process; and (d) There is a role for the patient, albeit not particularly well-defined or explicit, as a conduit for essential information communication. Conclusion: Cognitive artefact analysis is an innovative method to provide insights into transitions of patient care. It may be most useful to think about interventions at both the individual patient and the system levels that more fully address and overcome the system issues at work.

However, the existing research focused on AI-based IoT Botnet detection research in wired network environments. In addition, the existing research related to IoT Botnet detec-tion in ML-based mobile network environments have been conducted up to 4G. Therefore, this paper conducts a study on ML-based IoT Botnet traffic detection in the 5G core network. The binary and multiclass classification was performed to compare simple normal/malicious detection and normal/three-type IoT Botnet malware detection. In both classification methods, the IoT Botnet detection performance using only 5GC's GTP-U packets decreased by at least 22.99% of accuracy compared to detection in wired network environment. In addition, by conducting a feature importance experiment, the importance of feature study for IoT Botnet detection considering 5GC network characteristics was confirmed. Since this paper analyzed IoT botnet traffic passing through the 5GC network using ML and presented detection results, think it will be meaningful as a reference for research to link AI-based security to the 5GC network.

Calibrating Snakehead Diversity with DNA Barcodes: Expanding Taxonomic Coverage to Enable Identification of Potential and Established Invasive Species	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COMPLETE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME; CHANNA-ARGUS; EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS; POTOMAC RIVER; FISH; PERCIFORMES; PUNCTATUS; MACULATA	Detecting and documenting the occurrence of invasive species outside their native range requires tools to support their identification. This can be challenging for taxa with diverse life stages and/or problematic or unresolved morphological taxonomies. DNA barcoding provides a potent method for identifying invasive species, as it allows for species identification at all life stages, including fragmentary remains. It also provides an efficient interim taxonomic framework for quantifying cryptic genetic diversity by parsing barcode sequences into discontinuous haplogroup clusters (typical of reproductively isolated species) and labelling them with unique alphanumeric identifiers. Snakehead fishes are a diverse group of opportunistic predators endemic to Asia and Africa that may potentially pose significant threats as aquatic invasive species. At least three snakehead species (Channa argus, C. maculata, and C. marulius) are thought to have entered North America through the aquarium and live-food fish markets, and have established populations, yet their origins remain unclear. The objectives of this study were to assemble a library of DNA barcode sequences derived from expert identified reference specimens in order to determine the identity and aid invasion pathway analysis of the non-indigenous species found in North America using DNA barcodes. Sequences were obtained from 121 tissue samples representing 25 species and combined with public records from GenBank for a total of 36 putative species, which then partitioned into 49 discrete haplogroups. Multiple divergent clusters were observed within C. gachua, C. marulius, C. punctata and C. striata suggesting the potential presence of cryptic species diversity within these lineages. Our findings demonstrate that DNA barcoding is a valuable tool for species identification in challenging and under-studied taxonomic groups such as snakeheads, and provides a useful framework for inferring invasion pathway analysis.

Influences on the dietary intakes of preschool children: a systematic scoping review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY			English	Review						Diet; Scoping review; Preschool children; Ecological systems theory	FATHERS FEEDING PRACTICES; CHILDHOOD; PATTERNS; DRINK; FOOD	Background Better diet quality of preschool children is associated with many important health outcomes, but there is significant room for improvement in many children's dietary intakes. The determinants of children's dietary intakes are complex and whole systems approaches may be effective tools for changing dietary intake. Collation of all the evidence available on determinants of preschool children's dietary intake is necessary to 'map' the whole system of influence. Therefore, this systematic scoping review of available literature on determinants of dietary intakes in preschool children was undertaken. Methods The Joanna Briggs Institute methods for conducting a systematic scoping review were followed. Articles published since 2000 which assessed influences on the dietary intakes of preschool children were identified, yielding a total of 246 papers. Studies of children with clinical conditions (excluding obesity), or those conducted in middle and low-income countries were excluded, due to the different systems of influence in these populations. Data were extracted and information synthesised based on ecological level (child, parent, household, childcare, or wider determinants). Results Most articles focused on influences at the parental level (n = 118, 48%), followed by those at the child level (n = 73, 30%). Most of the studies were of cross-sectional design (n = 109, 44%). Whilst many studies considered influences at multiple ecological levels (n = 63, 26%) few analyses determined interactions between factors in their relationship with children's dietary intakes, which is needed going forward using systems methods. Conclusion A wealth of evidence exists examining influences on the dietary intakes of preschool children and this information would benefit from analysis using a systems thinking approach in order to assess effective levers for intervention and what works, for whom, under what circumstances.

Various countries have different requirements for information but most often focus on economic evaluation, which often plays a stronger role in healthcare decision making than does clinical evidence. Material/Methods: To identify all potential challenges in economic evaluation, the case of a new biological drug, rituximab, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, has been taken as an example. We present methods and results of economic assessment, highlighting the specific issues that should be considered in countries with economic and health care conditions similar to those of Hungary. Results: In principle, economic evaluation requires data on characteristics of target population, disease progression, treatment impact, preferences, resource utilizations and unit prices. Treatment effect/relative risk reduction and clinical practice patterns (resource use) may be more generalizable, whereas prices and baseline risk need to be jurisdiction specific. In order to address issues of transferability, investments need to be made in the collection of epidemiological and demographic data, plus data on clinical practice patterns, resource use, costs and health state valuations. In Hungary this problem has been solved through conducting a well designed 255 patient cross-sectional study. Conclusions: The Hungarian example shows that there should be more investment in data collection for those parameters that are thought to differ most from place to place. Owing to the similarities between Central and Eastern Europe countries in health care systems, clinical practice patterns and economic indicators, they may be able to develop partnerships to develop relevant regional databases and registries.

Revisiting Cattle Temperament in Beef Cow-Calf Systems: Insights from Farmers' Perceptions about an Autochthonous Breed	ANIMALS			English	Article						cattle temperament; focus group discussion; human-animal interaction; farmers perception; autochthonous cattle breed		Simple Summary Temperament is a key issue in beef cattle production systems, as it defines the responses of animals to human handling and to potentially challenging or fear-eliciting situations. However, little is known about how farmers define or assess temperament. Focus group discussions were carried out in order to analyze the perceptions of farmers regarding a series of temperament traits of animals, focusing on the Pyrenean cattle breed. Farmers described animal temperament using several adjectives such as "strong", "aggressive", "nervous", "fearful", "brave", or "smart", which account for their integrative vision of this concept. They reported a differential long-term development of the temperament of cows and bulls and mentioned that external features are not reliable indicators of temperament as compared with animal behavior. Sensory acuity, such as sight, hearing, and smell, were thought to be related to temperament. The results of this study are useful to better understand the decisions of farmers about cattle buying, selling, or culling, and their perspective about temperament should be considered in the research and design of genetic improvement schemes. Understanding temperament is an important part of cattle production since undesirable temperament may cause serious problems associated with aggression, maternal care, and human safety. However, little is known about how farmers define or assess temperament, especially in autochthonous cattle breeds. The aim of this study was to explore perceptions of farmers about the temperament of the Pyrenean cattle breed with special attention to beef cow-calf systems in Spain. The methodology used to obtain the information was focus group discussions (FGD). Farmers defined temperament as a behavioural response to challenging situations imposed by human handling. Specific terms used were related to active or passive reactions to fear (e.g., "strong", "aggressive", "nervous", "fearful"). The speed of response to stimuli was also important. Female temperament was thought to become more docile with age while bull temperament was more variable. Maternal aggressiveness was highlighted as a potential human safety problem, but also desirable in an extensively bred animal who may need to defend calves against predators. Anatomical characteristics were seen as unreliable predictors of temperament, while behavioural indicators were more widely used, such as "alertness", which was a general trait of the breed, and "gaze", which, when associated with an alert expression, suggests a potential threat. Sensory acuity, such as sight and smell, were thought to be related with temperament in some FGDs but there was no overall agreement as to whether different behavioural responses were due to differences in sensory acuity. The results from the study could be useful during training programs or in the development of new genetic selection schemes and evaluation protocols involving cattle temperament.

There is limited understanding of the implementation of a research-based curriculum in a whole degree programme, and few studies examined how faculty members and students perceived such a curriculum. This study explored faculty members' perceptions and students' experiences of four research-based curricula in two research-intensive universities in Hong Kong. Based on document review, 18 faculty interviews, and 113 student interviews, we discovered an overall positive view of research-based curricula but also substantial differences between faculty members' perceptions and students' experiences. For example, faculty members emphasised the learning and critical evaluation of knowledge. In comparison, students focused on exploring specific interesting issues and collecting and analysing information without fully recognising the potential of research in generating, applying, and validating knowledge. Moreover, students' experiences of research-based curricula contained a broader scope of activities than the curriculum perceived by faculty members. These gaps demonstrate that the fundamental goals of research-based curricula to develop 'powerful knowledge' and induct students into disciplinary ways of thinking have yet to be fully achieved. The study implies a need to enhance communication between students and faculty members and build a consensus on designing and supporting undergraduate research across the curriculum.	[Zou, Tracy X.

Inner Mongolia Cashmere goats (Capra hircus) have a double coat comprising the primary and secondary hair follicles, which have dramatically different sizes and textures. The Cashmere goat is rapidly becoming a potent model for hair follicle morphogenesis research. In this study, we established two dermal papilla cell lines during the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle from the primary and secondary hair follicles and clarified the similarities and differences in their morphology and growth characteristics. High-throughput transcriptome sequencing was used to identify gene expression differences between the two dermal papilla cell lines. Many of the differentially expressed genes are involved in vascularization, ECM-receptor interaction and Wnt/beta-catenin/Lef1 signaling pathways, which intimately associated with hair follicle morphogenesis. These findings provide valuable information for research on postnatal morphogenesis of hair follicles.

Installing an ERP system is, however, expensive and risky. IT managers must decide how to use their limited resources and invest in the right product. Can an ERP system directly improve SCM competency? This study proposes a conceptual framework featuring the ERP benefits and SCM competencies, and examines the impacts of the former on the latter. The results confirm the operational, managerial, and strategic benefits of ERP for the SCM competencies, but not the IT infrastructure and organizational benefits as significant predictors of them. Moreover, more than 80% of respondents think it necessary to first adopt an ERP system as the backbone of company operations before deploying other enterprise systems (ES), such as the SCM system.

J	Tu, JC; Yang, C				Tu, Jui-Che; Yang, Chun			Key Factors Influencing Consumers' Purchase of Electric Vehicles	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						electric vehicles; TPB; TAM; IDT; structural equation model	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION CHARACTERISTICS; ACCEPTANCE; ADOPTION; USAGE	Although the rapid progress of the global economy and technology has advanced human civilization, it has also caused tremendous damage to the global ecological environment. Therefore, humans are thinking seriously about the environment and its sustainable development. One of the solutions to environmental problems is new energy vehicles. Since the promulgation of the Energy Saving and New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan (2012-2020) by the General Office of the State Council, the Chinese government has determined a strategy of pure electric driving technology. The electric vehicle market in China has expanded rapidly, making China the largest electric vehicle market in the world. Hence, research on the situation of electric vehicles in China is highly necessary and of reference value for other countries to develop electric vehicles. As a result, it is a critical issue to develop low-carbon, energy-saving, and intelligent electric vehicles to reduce the environmental impact. This paper establishes a theoretical framework based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), technology acceptance model (TAM) and innovation diffusion theory (IDT), and explores the key factors influencing consumers' purchase of electric vehicles. The results show that: The application of the key factor model constructed in this study to consumers' behavioral intention regarding electric vehicle purchase is acceptable. According to the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis results, (1) In terms of behavioral intention: Consumers' control over the resources required to purchase electric vehicles has the highest influence on their behavioral intention, while consultation opinions from consumers' surroundings also significantly affect their behavioral intention to purchase electric vehicles. In addition, consumers' environmental awareness and acceptance of technology products will also influence their behavioral intention. (2) In terms of attitude toward behavior: When consumers believe that electric vehicles are more beneficial at the individual, environment or national level, or they believe that the usage of electric vehicles is simpler and more convenient, they will show a more positive attitude towards the purchase of electric vehicles. Consumers consider electric vehicles as forward-looking technology products with similar driving operation and usage cost compared to traditional vehicles. (3) In terms of regulations: The opinions of consumers' family members, friends, colleagues or supervisors do not significantly affect the attitude or behavior of consumers regarding electric vehicle purchase. The key factors influencing consumers' purchase of electric vehicles are not only applicable to the design and development of electric vehicles that better suit consumer demands, but also serve as a theoretical basis for the popularization of electric vehicles, and provide a reference for consumers' choice and purchase. Therefore, the government and relevant manufacturers need to consider increasing the publicity of electric vehicles and launch more attractive battery and charging schemes to attract consumers and promote the sustainable development of the automobile industry.

Yet, to ensure that the IHT is accepted and used, a human-centered design process is needed, actively involving end users in all steps of the development process. A first critical, predevelopment step involves understanding end users' characteristics. This study therefore aims to (a) select an IHT platform to deliver a self-management support intervention most closely related to Tx patients' current use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), (b) understand Tx patients' overall willingness to use IHT for self-management support, and investigate associations with relevant technology acceptance variables, and (c) explore Tx patients' views on potential IHT features. Design and MethodsWe performed a cross-sectional, descriptive study between October and December 2013, enrolling a convenience sample of adult heart, lung, liver, and kidney Tx patients from the University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium. Broad inclusion criteria were applied to ensure a representative patient sample. We used a 35-item newly designed interview questionnaire to measure Tx patients' use of ICTs, their overall willingness to use IHT, and their views on potential IHT features, as well as relevant technology acceptance variables derived from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and a literature review. Descriptive statistics were used as appropriate, and an ordinal logistic regression model was built to determine the association between Tx patients' overall willingness to use IHT, the selected technology acceptance variables, and patient characteristics. FindingsOut of 139 patients, 122 agreed to participate (32 heart, 30 lung, 30 liver, and 30 kidney Tx patients; participation rate: 88%). Most patients were male (57.4%), married or living together (68%), and had a mean age of 55.9 13.4 years. Only 27.9% of Tx patients possessed a smartphone, yet 72.1% owned at least one desktop or laptop PC with wireless Internet at home. On a 10-point numeric scale, asking patients whether they think IHT development is important to support them personally in their self-management, patients gave a median score of 7 (25th percentile 5 points; 75th percentile 10 points). Patients who were single or married or living together were more likely to give a higher rating than divorced or widowed patients; patients who completed only secondary education gave a higher rating than higher educated patients; and patients with prior ICT use gave a higher rating than patients without prior ICT use. Tx patients also had clear preferences regarding IHT features, such as automatic data transfer, as much as possible, visual aids (e.g., graphs) over text messages, and personally deciding when to access the IHT. ConclusionsBy investigating Tx patients' possession and use of ICTs, we learned that computers and the Internet, and not smartphones, are the most suitable IHT platforms to deliver self-management interventions for our Tx patients. Moreover, Tx patients generally are open to using IHT, yet patient acceptance variables and their preferences for certain IHT features should be taken into account in the next steps of IHT development. Designers intending to develop or use existing IHTs should never overlook this critical first step in a human-centered design. Clinical RelevanceBefore considering using eHealth technology in clinical practice, professionals should always check whether patients are familiar with using information and communication technology, and whether they are willing to use technology for health-related purposes.

Features and usability assessment of a patient-centered mobile application (HeartMapp) for self-management of heart failure	APPLIED NURSING RESEARCH			English	Article						Heart failure; Self-management; Patient engagement; Mobile application; HeartMapp usability; IMB model	BEHAVIORAL SKILLS MODEL; BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY; RATE-VARIABILITY; 6-MINUTE WALK; CARE; INTERVENTIONS; ADHERENCE; RELIABILITY; VALIDITY; TRIAL	Background: Mobile health technologies have emerged as a way to actively engage patients in their healthcare decision-making process. One who is well informed and motivated is thought to engage in self-management activities. Thus, the conceptual framework included "information, motivation, and behavioral change" model, with patient engagement as a mediator in the development and assessment of a mobile health application "HeartMapp" for chronic heart failure (CHF) self-management. Purpose: To describe the development and features of the HeartMapp and preliminary assessment of the usability of HeartMapp. Method: A descriptive survey design was employed. A total of 37 participants (25 patients with CHF and 12 health care workers) navigated the HeartMapp and completed self-confidence and usability questionnaires. Results: More than half of the patients used mobile phones to obtain health information. Patients reported moderate self-confidence (mean 26.60 +/- 12.18) in using HeartMapp. One in five patients reported a lack of confidence in using the chest-wom Bluetooth device. The observational data indicated that all patients completed the task of navigating the HeartMapp with little or no help. The health care members (n = 12) demonstrated high confidence in recommending HeartMapp to patients (mean 4.58 +/- 0.67) and in utilizing data from HeartMapp for clinical decision making (mean 4.50 +/- 0.67). The self-confidence and usability questionnaires showed good reliability in this sample. Conclusion: Having access to CHF symptom monitoring and education readily available in a mobile app may motivate individuals to engage in the prescribed self-management skills to ultimately attain desired outcomes, which warrants further exploration.

Humans quickly learn to blink strategically in response to environmental task demands	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						eye blinks; interblink intervals; computational modeling; internal costs; individual differences	SPONTANEOUS EYEBLINK ACTIVITY; HIGHER-ORDER ABERRATIONS; EYE BLINKING; TEAR FILM; SERIAL MEASUREMENTS; OPTICAL-QUALITY; PRIMARY GAZE; INHIBITION; FREQUENCY; PATTERN	Eye blinking is one of the most frequent human actions. The control of blinking is thought to reflect complex interactions between maintaining clear and healthy vision and influences tied to central dopaminergic functions including cognitive states, psychological factors, and medical conditions. The most imminent consequence of blinking is a temporary loss of vision. Minimizing this loss of information is a prominent explanation for changes in blink rates and temporarily suppressed blinks, but quantifying this loss is difficult, as environmental regularities are usually complex and unknown. Here we used a controlled detection experiment with parametrically generated event statistics to investigate human blinking control. Subjects were able to learn environmental regularities and adapted their blinking behavior strategically to better detect future events. Crucially, our design enabled us to develop a computational model that allows quantifying the consequence of blinking in terms of task performance. The model formalizes ideas from active perception by describing blinking in terms of optimal control in trading off intrinsic costs for blink suppression with task-related costs for missing an event under perceptual uncertainty. Remarkably, this model not only is sufficient to reproduce key characteristics of the observed blinking behavior such as blink suppression and blink compensation but also predicts without further assumptions the well-known and diverse distributions of time intervals between blinks, for which an explanation has long been elusive.

A class of 39 university students in Taiwan participated in the VR-supported creative project with the instructor's guidance step by step. A creative self-efficacy student scale, an intrinsic motivation inventory and an open-ended survey were given to the students to explore how the project might have influenced their efficacy for creativity and learning of English. Results indicate that the VR-supported project facilitated the students' efficacy for creative thinking in particular; yet, their efficacy for creative production as well as for their own competence while facing negative feedback did not change significantly. Moreover, those who had high creative self-efficacy also felt less pressure and tension toward this VR-supported project than their counterparts with low creative self-efficacy. Furthermore, working on the VR-supported project was perceived by the students to be a refreshing and relaxing learning experience that also benefited their learning of English. Based on the research findings, pedagogical implications are discussed with regard to how VR technology can be effectively integrated into an English classroom to facilitate students' creative self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation.

South Africa has not yet implemented this labeling system. The aim of this study was therefore to explore adult South African consumers' perceptions of front-of-package warning labels on foods and non-alcoholic beverages (referred to as drinks in this paper) and their insights into features that could influence the effectiveness of the warning label. Using a qualitative approach, the study purposively selected consumers diversified by urbanization, gender, socioeconomic status, and literacy. We collected data from a total of 113 participants through 12 focus group discussions. Data were systematically coded and divided into five themes namely, positive attitudes toward warning labels, perceived benefits of warning labels, perceived behavior modification, perceived beneficiaries of warning labels, and effective attributes of warning labels. Almost all participants from all socio-economic backgrounds were positive about warning labels, reporting that warning labels concisely and understandably educated them about the nutritional composition of foods. Other perceived advantages were that warning labels warn of health implications, are easily understandable and could benefit child health. Some participants anticipated that warning labels would reduce their purchases of unhealthy foods, while others thought the labels would have no effect on their purchasing habits. Participants found the warning labels attention grabbing and stated that they preferred a black triangle placed on a white background (referred to as a holding strap henceforth), the words "high in" and "warning" in bold and uppercase text, an exclamation mark, and an icon depicting the excessive nutrient. In South Africa warning labels may improve consumer understanding of nutrition information and assist consumers in determining the nutritional quality of packaged foods and drinks.

Integration Operations during Irony Processing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ERP EVIDENCE; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EEG ALPHA; MEMORY; DISCOURSE; SENTENCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; POTENTIALS; RETRIEVAL	The combined knowledge of word meanings and grammatical rules does not allow a listener to grasp the intended meaning of a speaker's utterance. Pragmatic inferences on the part of the listener are also required. The present work focuses on the processing of ironic utterances (imagine a slow day being described as "really productive'') because these clearly require the listener to go beyond the linguistic code. Such utterances are advantageous experimentally because they can serve as their own controls in the form of literal sentences (now imagine an active day being described as "really productive'') as we employ techniques from electrophysiology (EEG). Importantly, the results confirm previous ERP findings showing that irony processing elicits an enhancement of the P600 component (Regel et al., 2011). More original are the findings drawn from Time Frequency Analysis (TFA) and especially the increase of power in the gamma band in the 280-400 time-window, which points to an integration among different streams of information relatively early in the comprehension of an irony. This represents a departure from traditional accounts of language processing which generally view pragmatic inferences as late-arriving. We propose that these results indicate that unification operations between the linguistic code and contextual information play a critical role throughout the course of irony processing and earlier than previously thought.

Differences in Physician and Patient Ratings of Items Used to Assess Hip Disorders	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Article						outcome; questionnaire; self-report; instrument; patient perspective	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; DISABILITIES; VALIDATION; SYMPTOMS	Background: The purpose of this study was to determine what issues are important to active individuals with hip lesions and to assess whether these issues are different from those that surgeons think are important. Hypothesis: A discrepancy will be noted between what patients and surgeons believe to be important. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: This study comprised 150 consecutive patients (73 men, 77 women) from the international practices of 9 orthopaedic surgeons specializing in the management of hip disorders. All participants were seeking treatment for musculoskeletal hip disease. Average patient age was 42 +/- 11 years (range, 18-60). Patients and surgeons rated the importance of 146 potential hip outcome assessment items on a 6-point Likert-type scale. Results: Of the 23 items identified as being important to patients, 16 were in the sports and recreation category. The top 11 items that the clinicians thought were most important were rated significantly lower by patients (P < .0005). Specifically, surgeons rated several items as being important that fell into the symptoms, functional limitations, and occupational issues categories, whereas patients did not. That is, a difference was found between patients and clinicians in how they rated items related to symptoms, functional limitations, and occupation (P < .01). A difference was not found between patients and surgeons in how they rated items related to sports and recreation and social-emotional lifestyle (P > .01). Conclusion: The hypothesis of this study was affirmed: a discrepancy was found between what issues patients believe are important and what surgeons perceive as being important to patients. This information may be particularly important when assessing treatment outcomes from a patient's perspective. Clinicians must be careful in presuming that the issues that they are attempting to improve with treatment are issues that are important to patients. These findings also emphasize the importance of discussing appropriate postoperative expectations for those considering surgery.

To do so, we center two moments of the Ugandan bridal industry: the international trade of imported dresses and their design and refashioning there. Via the journeys of these dresses, we make visible how connected racial-gendered and classed power relations structure, drive, and manifest global trade networks. We provide geographically contextualized accounts of the gendered-racialization of economies, while always tracing the ties between varied forms of that racialization across place and through history. And we demonstrate the agency and crucial economic worldmaking of African women who labor within and fashion economic geographies. More broadly, we use dress, and the act of dressing up, in two ways. First, via a global Black feminist lens, we show how dress can be a deeply instructive material object that tells us much about the geographies of economies. Second, we use dress as a metaphor for urgent and playful connection, helping us to refashion the subfield of economic geography as feminist, antiracist, and critically transformative.

Should we sample a time series more frequently?: decision support via multirate spectrum estimation	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Aliasing; Bayesian statistics; Multirate; Spectrum estimation; Time series	LEAST-SQUARES; SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION; MEMORY PARAMETER; MODEL SELECTION; SPACED DATA; REGRESSION; INFLATION; VARIABLES; MOVEMENT; BIAS	Suppose that we have a historical time series with samples taken at a slow rate, e.g. quarterly. The paper proposes a new method to answer the question: is it worth sampling the series at a faster rate, e.g. monthly? Our contention is that classical time series methods are designed to analyse a series at a single and given sampling rate with the consequence that analysts are not often encouraged to think carefully about what an appropriate sampling rate might be. To answer the sampling rate question we propose a novel Bayesian method that incorporates the historical series, cost information and small amounts of pilot data sampled at the faster rate. The heart of our method is a new Bayesian spectral estimation technique that is capable of coherently using data sampled at multiple rates and is demonstrated to have superior practical performance compared with alternatives. Additionally, we introduce a method for hindcasting historical data at the faster rate. A freeware R package, regspec, is available that implements our methods. We illustrate our work by using official statistics time series including the UK consumer price index and counts of UK residents travelling abroad, but our methods are general and apply to any situation where time series data are collected.

Supporting patients to prepare for total knee replacement: Evidence-, theory- and person-based development of a 'Virtual Knee School' digital intervention	HEALTH EXPECTATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						digital intervention; intervention development; mixed methods; prehabilitation; pre-operative education; total knee replacement	ARTHROPLASTY; HIP; SATISFACTION; PRINCIPLES	IntroductionDigital delivery of pre-operative total knee replacement (TKR) education and prehabilitation could improve patient outcomes pre- and post-operatively. Rigorously developing digital interventions is vital to help ensure they achieve their intended outcomes whilst mitigating their potential drawbacks. ObjectiveTo develop a pre-operative TKR education and prehabilitation digital intervention, the 'Virtual Knee School' (VKS). MethodsThe VKS was developed using an evidence-, theory- and person-based approach. This involved a mixed methods design with four phases. The first three focused on planning the VKS. The final phase involved creating a VKS prototype and iteratively refining it through concurrent think-aloud interviews with nine patients who were awaiting/had undergone TKR. Meta-inferences were generated by integrating findings from all the phases. ISRCTN registration of the overall project was obtained on 24 April 2020 (ISRCTN11759773). ResultsMost participants found the VKS prototype acceptable overall and considered it a valuable resource. Conversely, a minority of participants felt the prototype's digital format or content did not meet their individual needs. Participants' feedback was used to refine the prototype's information architecture, design and content. Two meta-inferences were generated and recommend: Comprehensive pre-operative TKR education and prehabilitation support should be rapidly accessible in digital and non-digital formats.Pre-operative TKR digital interventions should employ computer- and self-tailoring to account for patients' individual needs and preferences.1.2. ConclusionsIntegrating evidence, theory and stakeholders' perspectives enabled the development of a promising VKS digital intervention for patients awaiting TKR. The findings suggest future research evaluating the VKS is warranted and provide recommendations for optimising pre-operative TKR care. Patient or Public ContributionPatient and Public Involvement (PPI) was central throughout the project. For example, PPI representatives contributed to the project planning, were valued members of the Project Advisory Group, had key roles in developing the VKS prototype and helped disseminate the project findings.

Adaptive Avoidance of Reef Noise	PLOS ONE			English	Article							UNDERWATER SOUND; LARVAL FISHES; ORIENTATION; SETTLEMENT; HABITATS; ATTRACTION; AUSTRALIA; PATTERNS; CUE	Auditory information is widely used throughout the animal kingdom in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Some marine species are dependent on reefs for adult survival and reproduction, and are known to use reef noise to guide orientation towards suitable habitat. Many others that forage in food-rich inshore waters would, however, benefit from avoiding the high density of predators resident on reefs, but nothing is known about whether acoustic cues are used in this context. By analysing a sample of nearly 700,000 crustaceans, caught during experimental playbacks in light traps in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, we demonstrate an auditory capability in a broad suite of previously neglected taxa, and provide the first evidence in any marine organisms that reef noise can act as a deterrent. In contrast to the larvae of species that require reef habitat for future success, which showed an attraction to broadcasted reef noise, taxa with a pelagic or nocturnally emergent lifestyle actively avoided it. Our results suggest that a far greater range of invertebrate taxa than previously thought can respond to acoustic cues, emphasising yet further the potential negative impact of globally increasing levels of underwater anthropogenic noise.

J	Yacoub, S; Mongkolsapaya, J; Screaton, G				Yacoub, Sophie; Mongkolsapaya, Juthathip; Screaton, Gavin			The pathogenesis of dengue	CURRENT OPINION IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Review						dengue; genetics; immunity; pathogenesis; review	ORIGINAL ANTIGENIC SIN; ENVELOPE DOMAIN III; T-CELL RESPONSES; HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER; VIRUS-INFECTION; TYPE-2 VIRUSES; SHOCK SYNDROME; RISK-FACTORS; SEROTYPE; ANTIBODIES	Purpose of review Dengue is one of the most rapidly spreading vector-borne diseases in the world, with the incidence increasing 30-fold in the past 50 years. There are currently no licensed treatments or vaccines for dengue. This review covers the recent advances in our understanding of dengue pathogenesis, including host and viral determinants. Recent findings The pathogenesis of severe dengue is thought to be immune-mediated due to the timing of the clinical manifestations and higher incidence in secondary infections with a heterologous serotype. Recent evidence has provided further information of neutralizing versus enhancing monoclonal antibodies and their target epitopes on the dengue virion, which has major implications for vaccine design. The role of T-cell immunopathology has also been advanced with recent evidence of cross-reactive high pro-inflammatory cytokine producing T cells predominating in severe dengue. Recent large genome-wide association studies have identified specific susceptibility loci associated with severe disease. Epidemiological studies have served to define certain at-risk groups and specific viral virulence factors have recently been described. Summary The pathogenesis of dengue is likely to be a complex interplay of host immunity and genetic predisposition combined with certain viral virulence factors. Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to severe dengue is crucial if we are to develop prognostic markers, novel diagnostics and therapeutics and ultimately a balanced and safe vaccine.

Recently, a prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT) revealed an association between levosimendan use and a possible increased risk of bleeding postoperatively. Levosimendan's anti-platelet effects have been shown in in vitro studies. Current studies do not provide sufficient data to support a relation between perioperative levosimendan administration and increased bleeding risk. Purpose Our goal was to investigate the relation between perioperative levosimendan administration and increased bleeding risk using a meta-analysis study design. Methods The PubMed, Ovid, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant RCTs before July 1, 2019. The outcome parameters included reoperation secondary to increased bleeding in the postoperative period, the amount of postoperative recorded blood loss, and the need for transfusion of packed red blood cells (RBCs) and other blood products. Results A total of 1160 patients in nine RCTs (576 in the levosimendan group and 584 in the control group) were included according to our inclusion criteria. Analysis showed that perioperative levosimendan administration neither increased the rate of reoperation secondary to bleeding nor increased the amount of postoperative chest tube drainage when compared with the control group. In terms of blood product transfusion, levosimendan did not influence the requirement for RBC transfusion, platelet transfusion nor fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion. Levosimendan also did not shorten or prolong the aortic cross-clamp time or the cardiopulmonary bypass time. Conclusion The analyzed parameters, including reoperations due to bleeding, postoperative chest drainage and the requirement for blood products, revealed that levosimendan did not increase postoperative bleeding risk. More studies with a larger sample size are needed to address a more reliable conclusion due to study limitations.

To find novel and potent 5-HT6 antagonists and to provide a new idea for drug design, we used a ligand-based pharmacophore to perform the virtual screening of a commercially available database. A three-dimensional common feature pharmacophore model was developed by using the HipHop program provided in Catalyst software and was used as a query for screening the database. A recursive partitioning (RP) model which can separate active and inactive compounds was used as a filtering system. Finally a sequential virtual screening procedure (SQSP) was conducted, wherein both the common feature pharmacophore and the RP model were used in succession to improve the results. Some of the hits were selected based on druglikeness, ADME properties, structural diversity, and synthetic accessibility for real biological evaluation. The best hit compound showed a significant IC50 value of 9.6 nM and can be used as a lead for further drug development.

NMDAR-Dependent Emergence of Behavioral Representation in Primary Visual Cortex	CELL REPORTS			English	Article							EXPERIENCE; RESPONSES; NEURONS; POTENTIATION; AREA	Although neocortical sensory areas are generally thought to faithfully represent external stimuli, cortical networks exhibit considerable functional plasticity, allowing them to modify their output to reflect ongoing behavioral demands, We apply longitudinal 2-photon imaging of activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice learning a conditioned eyeblink task to investigate the dynamic representations of task-relevant information. We find that, although all V1 neurons robustly and stably encode visual input, pyramidal cells and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons exhibit experience-dependent emergence of accurate behavioral representations during learning. The functional plasticity driving performance-predictive activity requires cellautonomous expression of NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Our findings demonstrate that accurate encoding of behavioral output is not inherent to V1 but develops during learning to support visual task performance.

We hypothesized that among adolescents who elect to bear their children, positive and/or ambivalent feelings about having a baby are the most frequently cited reasons for not having used contraceptives. Study Design: This is a cross-sectional, clinic-based survey of a racially and ethnically diverse group of 200 consecutively enrolled, poor, pregnant, 13-18-year-old patients in an adolescent-oriented maternity program. The participants completed a self-administered questionnaire which elicited information about environmental and personal risk factors for inconsistent use of contraceptives and information about the reasons they had not used contraceptives consistently prior to conception. Student's t-tests, Chi-square, and logistic regression analyses were used. Results: The most frequently cited reasons for not using contraceptives prior to conception were: ''I didn't mind getting pregnant'' (20%) and ''I wanted to get pregnant'' (17.5%), followed by ''I was using birth control but it didn't work (broke)'' (12%), ''I thought there was something wrong with me and I couldn't get pregnant'' (9%) and ''I just didn't get around to it'' (9%). Teenagers who cited positive and/or ambivalent attitudes toward childbearing as their primary reason for not using contraceptives at the time of conception did not differ from others with regard to age, Medicaid status, gravidity, parity, frequency of living with parents, partner's age, depressive symptoms, or perceived family support. They were, however, more likely to have known the father of the baby for more than 6 months at the time of conception [odds ratio (OR) 2.53; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-5.26) and to have dropped out of school (OR) 2.15; 95% CI 1.10-4.26]. Conclusions: The study hypothesis was supported. The absence of negative attitudes toward having babies rather than negative attitudes toward contraceptives is the most commonly cited reason for nonuse of contraceptives among childbearing adolescents. The results of this study may enable health care and social service providers to design more effective programs for preventing first and subsequent adolescent pregnancies.

J	Mombiola, AG				Guiteras Mombiola, Anna			The 'Indian Question' in the Bolivian Amazon: The School Centers of Casarabe and More	AMERICAS			English	Article						Bolivian Amazon; indigenous education; Warisata; Siriono; More		Education was an essential ingredient of the state strategy to address the so-called 'Indian question' in the Americas throughout the first half of the twentieth century. In the 1930s, Bolivian intellectuals promoted a new educational policy inspired by indigenismo, a trend of thought that sought to solve the problems faced by indigenous people concerning welfare, hygiene, agricultural techniques, and land issues; it also sought, to some extent, to teach them to value their own culture. The educational experience, originally conducted in the village of Warisata and then spread across the Andes, has merited special attention from historiography. However, very little is known about Warisata's replication in the country's lowlands. This paper explores the originality, scope, and limitations of the first project of socialization of 'non-subjected' societies of the Amazon Basin. That project was inspired by the postulates of the innovative Warisateno model, which aimed to give birth to a "new Indian" who would contribute actively and voluntarily to the progress of the nation. The categories adopted in that project, and the practices carried out, were inscribed in the positivists' thought, based on their view of the alleged "wild nature" and "savagery" of the groups with whom educators would interact. This study aims to contribute to the debate on the 'Indian question' in the Americas by highlighting the contradictions faced by intellectuals when designing projects for the "integration" of otherness into the nation.

Placebos in primary care? a nominal group study explicating UK GP and patient views of six theoretically plausible models of placebo practice	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							DELPHI	Objectives To better understand which theoretically plausible placebogenic techniques might be acceptable in UK primary care. Design A qualitative study using nominal group technique and thematic analysis. Participants took part in audio-recorded face-to-face nominal groups in which the researcher presented six scenarios describing the application in primary care of theoretically plausible placebogenic techniques: (1) Withholding side effects information, (2) Monitoring, (3) General practitioner (GP) endorsement, (4) Idealised consultation, (5) Deceptive placebo pills and (6) Open-label placebo pills. Participants voted on whether they thought each scenario was acceptable in practice and discussed their reasoning. Votes were tallied and discussions transcribed verbatim. Setting Primary care in England. Participants 21 GPs in four nominal groups and 20 'expert patients' in five nominal groups. Results Participants found it hard to decide which practices were acceptable and spoke about needing to weigh potential symptomatic benefits against the potential harms of lost trust eroding the therapeutic relationship. Primary care patients and doctors felt it was acceptable to harness placebo effects in practice by patient self-monitoring (scenario 2), by the GP expressing a strongly positive belief in a therapy (scenario 3) and by conducting patient-centred, empathic consultations (scenario 4). Deceptive placebogenic practices (scenarios 1 and 5) were unacceptable to most groups. Patient and GP groups expressed a diverse range of opinions about open-label placebo pills. Conclusions Attempts to harness placebo effects in UK primary care are more likely to be accepted and implemented if they focus on enhancing positive patient-centred communication and empathic relationships. Using placebos deceptively is likely to be unacceptable to both GPs and patients. Open-label placebos also do not have clear support; they might be acceptable to some doctors and patients in very limited circumstances-but further evidence, clear information and guidance would be needed.

One-year stability of the measure of processes of care	CHILD CARE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						childhood disability; family-centred service; Measure of Processes of Care; parental satisfaction; rehabilitation	PEDIATRIC HOME-CARE; CHILDREN; PARENTS; HEALTH; VALIDATION; SATISFACTION; PERCEPTIONS; QUALITY	Background The Measure of Processes of Care ( MPOC) is a 56- item self- administered measure designed to examine what parents of a child with a chronic health problem think of the services they and their child receive, and to measure the extent to which these services are family- centred. Reliability and validity of the MPOC were established in prior studies. The aim of the present study was to assess the 1- year stability of the MPOC to justify its use as an evaluative tool. Methods Nine paediatric rehabilitation centres in the Netherlands participated in this short longitudinal survey study. Subjects were 205 parents ( response rate 74.8%) of children aged 1 - 18 years who received care in one of the participating paediatric rehabilitation centres. All subjects filled out two MPOCs with a 1- year interval. Results All correlations between the scale scores of the MPOC at the first and second administration were relatively high and significant ( range: 0.443 - 0.609, all P < 0.001), demonstrating high inter- individual stability. However, all mean scale scores, except for Providing General Information, significantly reduced after 1 year. Conclusions The MPOC has a moderate 1- year stability. However, because of its tendency to score lower when repeated after 1 year, its use as an evaluative follow- up instrument to assess the effectiveness of a programme intervention is restricted.

This paper describes an evaluation study of the effectiveness of a hybrid basic genetics course for healthcare professionals combining web-based learning with traditional face-to-face instructional techniques. A multidisciplinary group from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created "Basic Genetics Education for Healthcare Providers" (BGEHCP). This program combined 7 web-based self-education modules with monthly traditional face-to-face lectures by genetics experts. The course was pilot tested by 186 healthcare providers from various disciplines with 69% (n = 129) of the class registrants enrolling in a pre-post evaluation trial. Outcome measures included critical thinking knowledge items and a Web-based Learning Environment Inventory (WEBLEI). Results indicated a significant (p < 0.001) change in knowledge scores. WEBLEI scores indicated program effectiveness particularly in the area of convenience, access and the course structure and design. Although significant increases in overall knowledge scores were achieved, scores in content areas surrounding genetic risk identification and ethical issues regarding genetic testing reflected continued gaps in knowledge. Web-based genetics education may help overcome genetics knowledge deficits by providing access for health professionals with diverse schedules in a variety of national and international settings.

However, its underlying mechanisms, its connection with Alzheimer disease and vascular cognitive impairment, and effects of therapy remain unclear. Objective: To test the hypothesis that DM promotes specific neuropathologic processes that contribute to dementia and that these processes may be suppressed by antidiabetic therapy. Design: A comprehensive neuropathologic assessment of all cases from a community-based study of incident dementia (Adult Changes in Thought Study) that underwent autopsies (n = 259) and had information on DM status (n = 196). Biochemical analysis was conducted on a subset of these cases with rapidly frozen brain tissue (n = 57). Participants: Autopsy cases were divided into 4 groups: no DM/no dementia (DM-/dementia-), DM/no dementia (DM+/dementia-), no DM/dementia (DM-/dementia+), and DM/dementia (DM+/dementia+). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) diagnosis of dementia was assigned through a consensus of experts following biennial cognitive and physical evaluations. Diabetes was diagnosed based on information obtained from participants' extensive medical records. Results: In cases without dementia (n = 125), neuropathologic and biochemical end points did not differ significantly by DM status. However, we observed 2 patterns of injury in patients with dementia (n = 71) by their DM status. Individuals without DM but with dementia (DM-/dementia+) had a greater amyloid-beta peptide load and increased levels of F-2-isoprostanes in the cerebral cortex, while DM+/dementia+ patients had more microvascular infarcts and an increased cortical IL-6 (interleukin 6) concentration. The number of microvascular infarcts was greater in deep cerebral structures in patients with dementia whose diabetes was treated, whereas amyloid plaque load tended to be greater for untreated diabetic patients with dementia. Conclusions: These novel characterizations of 2 different patterns of cerebral injury in patients with dementia depending on DM status may have etiologic and therapeutic implications.

J	Kaur, G; Smyth, RL; Powell, CVE; Williamson, P				Kaur, Geetinder; Smyth, Rosalind L.; Powell, Colin V. E.; Williamson, Paula			A survey of facilitators and barriers to recruitment to the MAGNETIC trial	TRIALS			English	Article						Recruitment; Children; Clinical trials; RCT (randomised controlled trial); Survey	CHILDREN	Background: Recruitment to randomised controlled trials with children is challenging. It is imperative to understand the factors that boost or hinder recruitment of children to clinical trials. We conducted a survey of facilitators and barriers to recruitment to the MAGNETIC trial, using a previously developed web-based tool. Methods: MAGNETIC is a multicentre randomised trial of nebulised magnesium in acute severe asthma, recruiting 508 children from 30 UK sites. Recruiters were asked to grade a list of factors from -3 to +3 depending on whether the factor was perceived as a strong, intermediate or weak barrier (-3 to -1) or facilitator (+1 to +3), and using (0) if it was thought to be not applicable. Free text responses were invited on strategies applied to counter the identified barriers. Results: The commonly identified facilitators were motivation and experience of study teams, effective communication and coordination between teams at site and between sites and the Clinical Trials Unit, the presence of designated research nurses, good trial management, clinical trial publicity, simple inclusion criteria, effective communication with parents and presentation of trial information in a simple and clear manner. The commonly identified barriers were heavy clinical workload, shift patterns of work, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training, inadequate number of trained staff, time and setting of consent seeking, non-availability of research staff out of hours and parents' concerns about their child taking an experimental medicine. Having a designated research nurse, arranging GCP training and trial-related training sessions for staff were the most commonly reported interventions. Conclusions: This study highlights important generic and trial-specific facilitators and barriers to recruitment to a paediatric trial in the acute setting and provides information on the recruitment strategies or interventions that were applied to overcome these barriers. This information can be very useful in informing the design and conduct of future clinical trials with children, particularly in the acute or emergency setting.

However, there is variation in delivery and outcomes. This study aims to understand processes that influence implementation using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to inform the design and delivery of services. Design An ethnographic study using observations and interviews with staff involved in service delivery. Data were analysed using a thematic analysis, followed by an abductive approach whereby themes were mapped onto the 31 constructs and 5 domains of the CFIR. Setting Four hospital sites in the UK delivering ERAS services for hip and knee replacement. Participants 38 staff participated including orthopaedic surgeons, nurses and physiotherapists. Results Results showed 17 CFIR constructs influenced implementation in all five domains. Within 'intervention characteristics', participants thought ERAS afforded advantages over alternative solutions and guidance was adaptable. In the 'outer setting', it was felt ERAS should be tailored to patients and education used to empower them in their recovery. However, there were concerns about postdischarge support and tensions with primary care. Within the 'inner setting', effective multidisciplinary collaboration was achieved by transferring knowledge about patients along the care pathway and multidisciplinary working practices. ERAS was viewed as a 'message' that had to be communicated consistently. There were concerns about resources and high volumes of patients. Staff access to information varied. At the domain 'characteristics of individuals', knowledge and beliefs impacted on implementation. Within 'process', involving opinion leaders in development and 'champions' who acted as a central point of contact, helped to engage staff. Formal and informal feedback helped to develop services. Conclusions Findings demonstrate successful implementation involves empowering patients to work towards recovery, providing postdischarge support and promoting successful multidisciplinary team working.

Successful recruitment and follow-up of PWID in cohort studies may require formative assessment of barriers PWID are faced with in participation and retention in cohort studies and factors they think may facilitate their engagement in such studies. Using a focus group discussion (FGD) format, we conducted a consultation with PWID in southeast Iran to recognize those barriers and motivators. Methods Using targeted sampling and through snowball referrals, we recruited PWID (aged >= 18, injected in last 6 months) from community-based drop-in centers (DICs), homeless shelters, and through outreach efforts to participate in four FGDs (one women-only). Socio-demographic characteristics, injection behaviors and self-reported HCV/HIV testing and diagnosis history were obtained. Then, a semi-structured FGD guide was applied to explore barriers and motivators to participation and retention in cohort studies among study participants. All FGD sessions were recorded and transcribed verbatim, removing any identifying information. The content of FGDs were analyzed by thematic analysis using an inductive approach. Results In total, 30 individuals (10 women) participated in the study. The median age of participants was 35 (IQR 31-40), with majority (73.3%) reporting injecting drug use within the last month. Only 40.0% reported ever being tested for HCV whereas a larger proportion (63.4%) reported ever being tested for HIV. While the majority were willing to participate in cohort studies, breach of confidentiality, fear of positive test results, perceived required commitment, and marginalization were reported as barriers to participation and retention in such studies. Monetary incentive, the thought of a better life, protection from police interventions and trust between health workers and PWID were addressed as motivators of engagement in cohort studies among PWID. Conclusions Strategies to enhance data security and reduce stigma associated with injecting drug use along with involving peer workers in research, providing pre and post-test counselling and education and addressing the needs of more marginalized groups potentially through integrated healthcare programs and housing support are among few approaches that may help address barriers and strengthen the motivators for successful cohort studies among this population.

An Evaluation of By <i>My Side</i>: Peer Support in Written Form is Acceptable and Useful for Parents Bereaved by Childhood Cancer	JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bereavement; child mortality; neoplasm/mortality; peer group; psychosocial support systems; parents	SOCIAL SUPPORT; DEATH; GRIEF; EXPERIENCES; ONCOLOGY; CARE; PARTICIPATION; NATIONWIDE; PROGRAM; ILLNESS	Context. Cancer is the leading cause of nonaccidental death in childhood, with the death of a child representing a devastating loss for families. Peer support offers a valuable way to support parents' adjustment in bereavement. The By My Side book provides written peer support by sharing bereaved parents' stories to normalize grief experiences and reduce parents' isolation. It is available free of charge. Objectives. This project evaluated the acceptability, relevance, emotional impact, and usefulness of By My Side. Design. Bereaved parents and health care professionals (HCPs) provided feedback via a questionnaire. We used descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis of open-ended responses to analyze the data. Setting/Participants. We mailed a study invitation and evaluation questionnaire to parents and HCPs who ordered a copy of By My Side. Results. About 24 bereaved parents and seven HCPs provided feedback. Parents thought the book's length (91.7%) and amount of information (83.3%) was just right. About 75% of parents reported that the book made them feel that their reactions to their child's death were normal and/or appropriate. Parents reported positive and negative emotional reactions to the book (e.g., 87.5% felt comforted, 87.5% felt sadness). All parents and HCPs reported that the book provided useful information about grief. About 83.4% of parents and 85.7% of HCPs would recommend it to others. Conclusion. By My Side was acceptable and useful to bereaved parents and HCPs. Results suggest that peer support in written form may help normalize aspects of grief and comfort parents bereaved by childhood cancer. (C) 2020 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

According to our previous work, it is known that a BCN under ASDC can be transformed into a switched Boolean network (SBN), and further global stability of the BCN under ASDC can be obtained by studying the global stability of the transformed SBN. Unfortunately, since the major idea of our previous work is to use stable subsystems to offset the state divergence caused by unstable subsystems, the SBN considered has at least one stable subsystem. The central thought in this paper is that switching behavior also has good stabilization; i.e., the SBN can also be stable with appropriate switching laws designed, even if all subsystems are unstable. This is completely different from that in our previous work. Specifically, for this case, the dwell time (DT) should be limited within a pair of upper and lower bounds. By means of the discretized Lyapunov function and DT, a sufficient condition for global stability is obtained. Finally, the above results are demonstrated by a biological example.

Here, we report a GPE in the single-crystalline MgB2 bilayers (S'/S), where the S' is the damaged MgB2 layer by cobalt (Co)-ion irradiation and the S is the undamaged MgB2 layer. Superconducting properties of the S' is remarkably degraded by the irradiation, whereas those of the S is uninfluenced by the irradiation. The degraded superconductivity in the S' is fully recovered similar to 95 nm of S' than the superconducting coherence length.ab(0) similar to 8.5 nm of the S, indicating a presence of GPE in the S'/S MgB2 bilayers. A diffusion of electrons in the S' into the S can reduce a pair breaking scattering in the S', and the similar electronic structures of S' and S layers and a finite attractive electron-electron interaction in the S' are thought to be origins of unpredicted GPE between the same superconducting materials. Both upper critical field (mu(0)Hc(2)) and in-field critical current density (Jc) of S'/S bilayers show a significant enhancement, representing a strong correlation between S' and S. These discoveries provide the blue print to the design of the superconducting multilayers for fundamental researches on the mechanism of the GPE as well as their technological applications.

Most original descriptions are based on empty shells and the high levels of variation in shape, color and pattern in some groups can make the shell a poor proxy for species-level identification. The deep-sea gastropod turbinid genus Bolma is one such example, where species-level identification based on shell characters alone is challenging. Here, we show that in Bolma both traditional and molecular taxonomic treatments are associated with a number of pitfalls that can lead to biased inferences about species diversity. Challenges derive from the few phylogenetically informative characters of shells, insufficient information provided in original descriptions and sampling artefacts, which at the molecular level in spatially fragmented organisms can blur distinctions between genetically divergent populations and separate species. Based on a comprehensive dataset combining molecular, morphological and distributional data, this study identified several cases of shell-morphological plasticity and convergence. Results also suggest that what was thought to be a set of distinct, range-restricted species corresponds instead to a smaller number of more widespread species. Overall, using an appropriate sampling design, including type localities, allowed us to assign available names to evolutionarily significant units.

J	Xu, G; Huang, J; Yang, Y; Yao, YA				Xu, Gang; Huang, Jian; Yang, Yong; Yao, Yin-an			Transcriptome Analysis of Flower Sex Differentiation in <i>Jatropha curcas</i> L. Using RNA Sequencing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PENTATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT PROTEIN; SMALL AUXIN; MICROARRAY ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL-ANALYSIS; CELL-PROLIFERATION; NEGATIVE REGULATOR; GENE-EXPRESSION; CRABS-CLAW; ARABIDOPSIS; MERISTEM	Background Jatropha curcas is thought to be a promising biofuel material, but its yield is restricted by a low ratio of instaminate / staminate flowers (1/10-1/30). Furthermore, valuable information about flower sex differentiation in this plant is scarce. To explore the mechanism of this process in J. curcas, transcriptome profiling of flower development was carried out, and certain genes related with sex differentiation were obtained through digital gene expression analysis of flower buds from different phases of floral development. Results After Illumina sequencing and clustering, 57,962 unigenes were identified. A total of 47,423 unigenes were annotated, with 85 being related to carpel and stamen differentiation, 126 involved in carpel and stamen development, and 592 functioning in the later development stage for the maturation of staminate or instaminate flowers. Annotation of these genes provided comprehensive information regarding the sex differentiation of flowers, including the signaling system, hormone biosynthesis and regulation, transcription regulation and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. A further expression pattern analysis of 15 sex-related genes using quantitative real-time PCR revealed that gibberellin-regulated protein 4-like protein and AMP-activated protein kinase are associated with stamen differentiation, whereas auxin response factor 6-like protein, AGAMOUS-like 20 protein, CLAVATA1, RING-H2 finger protein ATL3J, auxin-induced protein 22D, and r2r3-myb transcription factor contribute to embryo sac development in the instaminate flower. Cytokinin oxidase, Unigene28, auxin repressed-like protein ARP1, gibberellin receptor protein GID1 and auxin-induced protein X10A are involved in both stages mentioned above. In addition to its function in the differentiation and development of the stamens, the gibberellin signaling pathway also functions in embryo sac development for the instaminate flower. The auxin signaling pathway also participates in both stamen development and embryo sac development. Conclusions Our transcriptome data provide a comprehensive gene expression profile for flower sex differentiation in Jatropha curcas, as well as new clues and information for further study in this field.

J	Jepson, R; Weller, D; Alexander, F; Walker, J				Jepson, R; Weller, D; Alexander, F; Walker, J			Impact of UK Colorectal Cancer Screening Pilot on primary care	BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE			English	Article						cancer screening; primary health care; workload; evaluation	OCCULT-BLOOD-TEST; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL; SIGMOIDOSCOPY; MORTALITY	Background The UK Colorectal Cancer Screening Pilot has recently been completed to evaluate the feasibility of screening using the faecal occult blood test. Screening will be phased in over the next several years, and it is important to consider the impact on the NHS workforce. Aim To determine the impact of the UK Colorectal Cancer Screening Pilot on primary care workload. Design of study A retrospective survey and prospective audit of general practice staff. Setting General practice. Method Workload impact was assessed using a postal questionnaire and a prospective audit of activity in participating practices. Questionnaires were sent to practices that had been involved in the Pilot between 6 weeks and 1 year previously. They were sent to a random sample of 59 practices in Scotland and 60 practices in England between February 2001 and March 2002. Audit forms were sent prospectively to 60 practices involved in the Pilot between May 2001 and September 2002. Results Sixty-seven per cent of GPs, 82% of practice managers, 69% of practice nurses, and 70% of receptionists responded to the questionnaire. Of 60 practices contacted to take part in the workload audit, 38 returned completed 'workload impact audit' forms. Most practice staff indicated they spent 2% or less of their time during the screening period on Pilot-related activities. Forty per cent of GPs thought that a national colorectal cancer screening programme would substantially impact on the workload in primary care. However, there were variations by country: practice staff in Scotland were more likely to think that it would substantially impact on workload than practice staff in England (44.7% versus 26.6%). Conclusions The surveys and audit demonstrate that the Pilot has had a discernible, albeit modest, impact on workload in primary care. Workload of particular significance to primary care personnel includes increases in paperwork, administration, and information provision to patients. The majority of primary care staff support the introduction of a colorectal cancer screening programme. However, there is a strong perception, particularly among GPs, that a national programme of faecal occult blood test screening will impact significantly on workload in primary care, and that primary care-based activities generated through screening should be adequately resourced and remunerated.

Although this direction has attracted intensive attention, most of the literature in this area ignore the following three issues: (1) they think little of the underlying abstract hierarchical latent information existing in examples, even if extracting these abstract hierarchical latent representations is useful to better predict the class labels of examples; (2) the idea of preassigned model on unseen datapoints is not suitable for modeling streaming data with evolving probability distribution. This challenge is referred as "model flexibility". And so, with this in minds, the online deep learning model we need to design should have a variable underlying structure; (3) moreover, it is of utmost importance to fusion these abstract hierarchical latent representations to achieve better classification performance, and we should give different weights to different levels of implicit representation information when dealing with the data streaming where the data distribution changes. To address these issues, we propose a two-phase Online Deep Learning based on Auto-Encoder (ODLAE). Based on auto-encoder, considering reconstruction loss, we extract abstract hierarchical latent representations of instances; Based on predictive loss, we devise two fusion strategies: the output-level fusion strategy, which is obtained by fusing the classification results of encoder's each hidden layer; and feature-level fusion strategy, which is leveraged self-attention mechanism to fusion the every hidden layer's output. Finally, in order to improve the robustness of the algorithm, we also try to utilize the denoising auto-encoder to yield hierarchical latent representations. Experimental results on different datasets are presented to verify the validity of our proposed algorithm (ODLAE) outperforms several baselines.

Motivators and Barriers for Older People Participating in Resistance Training: A Systematic Review	JOURNAL OF AGING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY			English	Review						aging; ageing; strength training; weight training; motivators; barriers; systematic review	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; STRENGTH; EXERCISE; BENEFITS; ADULTS; WOMEN; PERCEPTIONS; BEHAVIOR; BELIEFS	Regular participation in resistance training is important for older people to maintain their health and independence, yet participation rates are low. The study aimed to identify motivators and barriers to older people participating in resistance training. A systematic review was conducted including quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies. Searches generated 15,920 citations from six databases, with 14 studies (n = 1,937 participants) included. In total, 92 motivators and 24 barriers were identified. Motivators specific to participating in resistance training included preventing deterioration (disability), reducing risk of falls, building (toning) muscles, feeling more alert, and better concentration. Looking too muscular and thinking participation increased the risk of having a heart attack, stroke, or death, despite the minimal likelihood of these occurring, were barriers. The analysis indicates that increasing participation in resistance training among older people should focus on the specific benefits valued by older people and the dissemination of accurate information to counter misperceptions.

Emergency contraception in Albania: a multimethods qualitative study of awareness, knowledge, attitudes and practices	CONTRACEPTION			English	Article						Eastern Europe; Emergency contraception; Provider training; Qualitative research; Reproductive health		Objectives: Contraceptive prevalence is relatively low in Albania, and abortion is the mainstay of family planning. Although levonorgestrel-only emergency contraceptive pills are available, uptake of this method is minimal. Emergency contraception (EC) could play a significant role in addressing women's need for an effective and discreet pregnancy prevention method. However, information about the dynamics surrounding EC is limited. Study design: In 2016-2017, we conducted a multimethods qualitative study that aimed to explore awareness, knowledge, attitudes and practices toward EC in Albania. This project comprised four components: a community-based survey with 115 respondents, six focus group discussions with women of reproductive age, 19 semistructured key informant interviews, and 16 structured interviews with retail pharmacists. We analyzed our data using descriptive statistics and for content and themes. Results: Our findings suggest that EC is widely available in pharmacies in Albania. However, a quarter of our survey participants did not know whether EC was available, and more than a third did not think EC was safe to use. Women face numerous barriers to accessing this form of contraception. Misconceptions about hormonal contraceptives, in general, and about progestin-only EC in particular, lack of training among providers, and stigma and fear of judgment were common obstacles identified by participants. Conclusions: Misinformation and lack of knowledge about EC among women and providers in Albania appears common. Training health service providers, raising awareness among women, and developing linguistically and culturally resonant materials for distribution could be keys to improving access to and use of EC. Implications: Although the availability of progestin-only EC is widespread in Albania, our findings suggest that more work needs to be done to align national regulatory policies with international standards, facilitate evidence-based service delivery, and increase access to medically accurate information in Albanian.

We aimed to assess the mental health burden of Chinese public during the outbreak, and to explore the potential influence factors. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. The overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality of the public were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Younger people reported a significantly higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people. Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers were more likely to have poor sleep quality. Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (< 35 years) and time spent focusing on the COVID-19 (>= 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were at high risk for poor sleep quality. Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during the COVID-19 outbreak. Younger people, people spending too much time thinking about the outbreak, and healthcare workers were at high risk of mental illness. Continuous surveillance of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide.

However, little is known about how rehabilitation professionals motivate stroke patients during rehabilitation. The primary objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive and quantitative list of motivational strategies for stroke rehabilitation. In addition, we aimed to examine (1) whether professionals with more clinical experience used a higher number of motivational strategies, (2) the purpose for using each strategy, and (3) the information considered when choosing strategies. Methods:This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted using a web survey with a convenience sample of 407 rehabilitation professionals including physicians, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language-hearing therapists. Results:We received data for 362 participants. Fifteen strategies were found to be used by more than 75% of the respondents to motivate their patients. Almost all of the respondents reported that they actively listened to and praised their patients to increase patient adherence to rehabilitation programs. Respondents with more clinical experience tended to use a higher number of motivational strategies (rho = 0.208,p< 0.001). For 11 of the 15 strategies selected by more than 75% of the respondents, the highest percentage of respondents reported that they used the strategies to make rehabilitation worthwhile for their patients. The majority of respondents reported that they decided which motivational strategy to use by considering comprehensive information regarding the patient health condition, environmental factors, and personal factors. Conclusions:The comprehensive list of motivational strategies obtained may be useful for increasing patient adherence to rehabilitation, especially for professionals with less clinical experience. Furthermore, our findings regarding the purpose for using each strategy and the information considered when choose strategies might help rehabilitation professionals to optimally utilize the motivational strategy list.

When the nose knows: ontogenetic changes in detection dogs' (<i>Canis familiaris</i>) responsiveness to social and olfactory cues	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						Canis familiaris; detection dog; domestic dog; object-choice task; olfaction; social cognition	EXPERIMENTER-GIVEN CUES; HUMAN POINTING GESTURES; BREED DIFFERENCES; HUMAN-COMMUNICATION; COMPREHENSION; CHOICE; DOMESTICATION; SENSITIVITY; PERFORMANCE; PET	Domestic dogs, Canis familiaris, are highly responsive to human communicative cues and can utilize gestures, such as pointing, to locate hidden rewards. This ability is thought to be the product of both genetic and behavioural selection, allowing dogs to adapt to life with humans. Dogs' responsiveness to human gestures can also lead to suboptimal choices when dogs readily follow misleading cues despite directly contradicting perceptual information such as odour cues. However, this bias likely reflects pet dogs' enculturation with humans and thus may not be representative of other populations of dogs. We investigated the ability of young dogs in training for explosives detection (N = 77) to locate a hidden reward using olfactory cues when presented in conflict with a deceptive communicative gesture in an object-choice task. We assessed performance at 3, 6 and 11 months of age using both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. We found that, contrary to previous findings with pet dogs, responsiveness to human pointing decreased with age, whereas the ability to locate the reward by scent increased. Furthermore, a lack of susceptibility to deceptive social cues was predictive of future success as a detection dog. These findings further indicate the influence of ontogenetic effects on canine social cognition and demonstrate potential applications for the identification of suitable detection dogs.

Does Chronic Unpredictable Stress during Adolescence Affect Spatial Cognition in Adulthood?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; BLACK-CAPPED CHICKADEES; CHRONIC SOCIAL STRESS; WORKING-MEMORY; WATER-MAZE; LEARNING-DEFICITS; NEUROGENESIS; YOUNG; LIFE; RATS	Spatial abilities allow animals to retain and cognitively manipulate information about their spatial environment and are dependent upon neural structures that mature during adolescence. Exposure to stress in adolescence is thought to disrupt neural maturation, possibly compromising cognitive processes later in life. We examined whether exposure to chronic unpredictable stress in adolescence affects spatial ability in late adulthood. We evaluated spatial learning, reference and working memory, as well as long-term retention of visuo-spatial cues using a radial arm water maze. We found that stress in adolescence decreased the rate of improvement in spatial learning in adulthood. However, we found no overall performance impairments in adult reference memory, working memory, or retention caused by adolescent-stress. Together, these findings suggest that adolescent-stress may alter the strategy used to solve spatial challenges, resulting in performance that is more consistent but is not refined by incorporating available spatial information. Interestingly, we also found that adolescent-stressed rats showed a shorter latency to begin the water maze task when re-exposed to the maze after an overnight delay compared with control rats. This suggests that adolescent exposure to reoccurring stressors may prepare animals for subsequent reoccurring challenges. Overall, our results show that stress in adolescence does not affect all cognitive processes, but may affect cognition in a context-dependent manner.

Quantitative genetics of plumage color: lifetime effects of early nest environment on a colorful sexual signal	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Animal model; barn swallow; developmental plasticity; heritability; melanin plumage color	AMERICAN BARN SWALLOWS; TAIL STREAMER LENGTH; MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; DEVELOPMENTAL STRESS; HONEST SIGNAL; SONG; BIRDS; EVOLUTION; SELECTION; AGE	Phenotypic differences among individuals are often linked to differential survival and mating success. Quantifying the relative influence of genetic and environmental variation on phenotype allows evolutionary biologists to make predictions about the potential for a given trait to respond to selection and various aspects of environmental variation. In particular, the environment individuals experience during early development can have lasting effects on phenotype later in life. Here, we used a natural full-sib/half-sib design as well as within-individual longitudinal analyses to examine genetic and various environmental influences on plumage color. We find that variation in melanin-based plumage color - a trait known to influence mating success in adult North American barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) - is influenced by both genetics and aspects of the developmental environment, including variation due to the maternal phenotype and the nest environment. Within individuals, nestling color is predictive of adult color. Accordingly, these early environmental influences are relevant to the sexually selected plumage color variation in adults. Early environmental conditions appear to have important lifelong implications for individual reproductive performance through sexual signal development in barn swallows. Our results indicate that feather color variation conveys information about developmental conditions and maternal care alleles to potential mates in North American barn swallows. Melanin-based colors are used for sexual signaling in many organisms, and our study suggests that these signals may be more sensitive to environmental variation than previously thought.

Managing Downy Brome (<i>Bromus tectorum</i>) in the Central Rockies: Land Manager Perspectives	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Human dimensions of invasive plants; cheatgrass; integrated pest management	INVASIVE PLANTS; SOIL BIOTA; IMPACTS; RANGE; PERCEPTIONS; CHEATGRASS; ATTITUDES; WEEDS	Successful management of downy brome (also known as cheatgrass) requires understanding land managers' perceptions and decisions about whether to invest in its control. We investigated ranchers' and natural resource professionals' (NRPs) perceptions and knowledge about downy brome ecology and its impacts, their current downy brome management practices and satisfaction with those practices, and their information and technical needs using focus groups and a mail survey of ranchers and NRPs in Colorado and Wyoming. Both groups thought downy brome was a problem, and perception of the severity of downy brome corresponded to the level of infestation in the respondent's region.,NRPs identified downy brome as a bigger problem than did ranchers from the same area in all but one region. Ranchers were most likely to use early spring grazing to control downy brome, and NRPs were most likely to use seeding, imazapic herbicide, or a combination of methods. Both groups reported that the primary constraint to controlling downy brome was that other weeds were a higher priority. Ranchers and NRPs wanted more information about the control methods they were already likely to use as well as other downy brome control methods. Our findings suggest that (1) listing a species as a noxious weed may provide an important incentive to control it, but trade-offs among control efforts for different species must be carefully considered; (2) managers need to know more about low-cost, low-labor strategies for managing downy brome; and (3) some managers need to be informed about how to identify downy brome, its potential negative effects, and how to prevent its spread. Better quantification of the economic and ecological impacts of downy brome in the Central Rocky Mountains, continued development of effective and economically viable management methods, and improvement in the dissemination of that information to land managers are necessary for successful control of downy brome.

Crown-of-thorns starfish have true image forming vision	FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Acanthaster planci; Sensory biology; Eyes; Orientation	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; URCHIN TUBE FEET; SEA-URCHIN; ACANTHASTER-PLANCI; OPHEODESOMA-SPECTABILIS; PHOTORECEPTOR SYSTEM; ASTERIAS-FORBESI; SPATIAL VISION; FINE-STRUCTURE; VISUAL-SYSTEM	Background: Photoreceptors have evolved numerous times giving organisms the ability to detect light and respond to specific visual stimuli. Studies into the visual abilities of the Asteroidea (Echinodermata) have recently shown that species within this class have a more developed visual sense than previously thought and it has been demonstrated that starfish use visual information for orientation within their habitat. Whereas image forming eyes have been suggested for starfish, direct experimental proof of true spatial vision has not yet been obtained. Results: The behavioural response of the coral reef inhabiting crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) was tested in controlled aquarium experiments using an array of stimuli to examine their visual performance. We presented starfish with various black-and-white shapes against a mid-intensity grey background, designed such that the animals would need to possess true spatial vision to detect these shapes. Starfish responded to black-and-white rectangles, but no directional response was found to black-and-white circles, despite equal areas of black and white. Additionally, we confirmed that starfish were attracted to black circles on a white background when the visual angle is larger than 14 degrees. When changing the grey tone of the largest circle from black to white, we found responses to contrasts of 0.5 and up. The starfish were attracted to the dark area's of the visual stimuli and were found to be both attracted and repelled by the visual targets. Conclusions: For crown-of-thorns starfish, visual cues are essential for close range orientation towards objects, such as coral boulders, in the wild. These visually guided behaviours can be replicated in aquarium conditions. Our observation that crown-of-thorns starfish respond to black-and-white shapes on a mid-intensity grey background is the first direct proof of true spatial vision in starfish and in the phylum Echinodermata.

This review summarizes available evidence on the effectiveness, economics, and satisfaction of peer support intervention on perinatal depression. Methods: Multiple electronic databases were searched in five English databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Psyc INFO, and CINAHL) and three Chinese databases (Wang Fang, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database) from inception to April 2019. Hand searching of references was also performed. Randomized controlled trials reporting peer support intervention targeting on perinatal depression were included. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: Ten randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Peer support intervention reduced standardized mean depressive scores (-0.37, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.08) and reduced risk ratio (0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.96) of depression. Limitations: Clinical heterogeneity was observed among the included studies in peer support intervention, suggesting the existence of potential mediators, such as intensity, frequency, or type of peer support intervention. Conclusion: Peer support intervention may have the potential to effectively prevent perinatal depression or reduce the harm of perinatal depression. Future studies with better design/execution and larger sample size are needed to investigate potential mediators associated with the beneficial effects of peer support intervention on perinatal depression.

Given a reference model, the objective is to design a controller that forces the measured system output to track the reference model output with bounded error. The components of the so called pseudocontrol, thought on a superposition effects principle, are the following: 1) the output of reference model, 2) the output of a Kalman type stabilizing compensator of the pair of systems composed by a) an output dynamics of a set of integrators of order tantamount to the assumed known relative degree r of the controlled system and b) an internal model, of order r - 1, oriented to the tracking error decreasing in the presence of step input signals, and 3) the adaptive control designed to approximately cancel the error of approximate dynamic inversion by virtue of whom the real control is hereby determined from pseudocontrol. A single hidden layer neural network is used to counteract this dynamic inversion error. The classical approach of pseudocontrol design based on tracking error dynamics estimation is evaded. A proof of stable working of this intelligent type controller is sketched. The mathematical model for the longitudinal dynamics of an experimental helicopter is used as framework of synthesis and validation by numerical simulations.

Recently, even higher piezoelectricity is observed in alternating current electric-field-poled (AC-poled) crystals. This poling technique may benefit many piezoelectric materials and corresponding applications. The scaling effect is quite important for piezoelectric applications, since the operational frequency of devices is associated with the dimension of piezoelectric elements. Here, we investigated the thickness dependence of dielectric and piezoelectric properties for AC-poled relaxor-PbTiO3 crystals. Compared with the traditional poling method, the piezoelectric coefficient (d(33)) and dielectric permittivity (epsilon(T)(33)/epsilon(0)) were found to be increased by 20%-30% via alternating current electric field poling (AC-poling). A weak scaling effect was observed for the samples with thickness above 200 mu m. While, for 100-mu m samples, the dielectric permittivity was only enhanced by 6%, and a clear degradation of properties was observed when the cycle of alternating current electric field is beyond three. These features are thought to be associated with the impacts of surface damages for thin samples. Of particular interest is that the coercive field was found to decrease during AC-poling, which should be considered for the design of piezoelectric devices. This work provides important information for AC-poled relaxor-PbTiO3 crystals and will benefit the piezoelectric applications using these crystals. Published under license by AIP Publishing.

The closure of schools has therefore been proposed as an efficient mitigation strategy. Such measures come however with high associated social and economic costs, making alternative, less disruptive interventions highly desirable. The recent availability of high-resolution contact network data from school environments provides an opportunity to design models of micro-interventions and compare the outcomes of alternative mitigation measures. Methods and results: We model mitigation measures that involve the targeted closure of school classes or grades based on readily available information such as the number of symptomatic infectious children in a class. We focus on the specific case of a primary school for which we have high-resolution data on the close-range interactions of children and teachers. We simulate the spread of an influenza-like illness in this population by using an SEIR model with asymptomatics, and compare the outcomes of different mitigation strategies. We find that targeted class closure affords strong mitigation effects: closing a class for a fixed period of time - equal to the sum of the average infectious and latent durations - whenever two infectious individuals are detected in that class decreases the attack rate by almost 70% and significantly decreases the probability of a severe outbreak. The closure of all classes of the same grade mitigates the spread almost as much as closing the whole school. Conclusions: Our model of targeted class closure strategies based on readily available information on symptomatic subjects and on limited information on mixing patterns, such as the grade structure of the school, shows that these strategies might be almost as effective as whole-school closure, at a much lower cost. This may inform public health policies for the management and mitigation of influenza-like outbreaks in the community.

A Systematic Review of Cognition in Chiari I Malformation	NEUROPSYCHOLOGY REVIEW			English	Review						Arnold Chiarimalformation; Cognition; Neuropsychological test; Systematic review	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; ANXIETY DISORDER; CEREBELLAR; HEALTH; ASSOCIATION; IMPAIRMENT; CHILDREN; THOUGHT; MOTOR; POPULATION	Displacement of the cerebellar tonsils in Chiari type I malformation (CMI) can affect functions controlled by the cerebellum and brainstem. While playing an integral role in the control of movement, the cerebellum also has widespread cortical connections, influencing a range of cognitive process. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the relationship between cognition and CMI, assessing evidence for general or domain-specific cognitive change. The search protocol examined the AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases. Articles meeting the following criteria were included in this review (i) examined children or adults with a clinically defined diagnosis of CMI, (ii) assessed cognitive function with a prospective examination, (iii) included at least one standardized instrument designed to measure general or specific domains of cognitive function, and (iv) were published in English in a peer-reviewed journal. Twelve articles were identified, including 783 cases aged 3 months to 64 years. General cognition, processing speed, and learning and memory appeared less affected, while language deficits appeared to diminish with age. Executive dysfunction was the most commonly reported cognitive impairment, while attention and working memory, and visuospatial and perceptual skills also appeared vulnerable. Numerous methodological limitations were identified that should be considered in interpreting the impact of CMI and planning future investigations. Overall, there is currently insufficient evidence to describe a valid and reliable profile of cognitive impairment in CMI. Further research is required to confirm these preliminary psychometric results and integrate them with pathophysiological models.

This Other Race Categorization Advantage (ORCA) is thought to reflect an enhanced sensitivity to the visual race signals of other race faces, leading to faster response times. The current study investigated this sensitivity in a cross-cultural sample of Swiss and Japanese observers with a race categorization task using faces that had been parametrically degraded of visual structure, with normalized luminance and contrast. While Swiss observers exhibited an increasingly strong ORCA in both reaction time and accuracy as the face images were visually degraded up to 20% structural coherence, the Japanese observers manifested this pattern most distinctly when the faces were fully structurally-intact. Critically, for both observer groups, there was a clear accuracy effect at the 20% structural coherence level, indicating that the enhanced sensitivity to other race visual signals persists in significantly degraded stimuli. These results suggest that different cultural groups may rely on and extract distinct types of visual race signals during categorization, which may depend on the available visual information. Nevertheless, heavily degraded stimuli specifically favor the perception of other race faces, indicating that the visual system is tuned by experience and is sensitive to the detection of unfamiliar signals.

Here, utilizing the control groups' data from three 1-week intervention studies in which young healthy adult subjects underwent a wide range of cognitive tests and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after the intervention period, we investigated how regional gray matter (GM) density (rGMD) of the subjects changed through voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Statistically significant increases in rGMD were observed in the anatomical cluster that mainly spread around the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the right superior frontal gyrus (rSFG). Moreover, mean rGMD within this cluster changes were significantly and positively correlated with performance changes in the Stroop task, and tended to positively correlate with performance changes in a divergent thinking task. Affected regions are considered to be associated with performance monitoring (dACC) and manipulation of the maintained information including generating associations (rSFG), and both are relevant to the cognitive functions measured in the cognitive tests. Thus, the results suggest that even in the groups of the typical "control group" in intervention studies including those of the passive one, experimental or non-experimental factors can result in an increase in the regional GM structure and form the association between such neural changes and improvements related to these cognitive tests. These results suggest caution toward the experimental study designs without control groups.

Access to Dry Season Agricultural Content in the Broadcast Media and Dry Season Irrigation Farming among Smallholder Farmers in Nigeria	AGRICULTURE-BASEL			English	Article						agricultural content; broadcast media; dry season agriculture; food security; irrigation farming; smallholder farmers; Nigeria		Inaccessibility to information could hinder the adoption of dry season agriculture which is very significant to ending the spate of food insecurity in Nigeria. This cross-sectional survey examined access to broadcast media agricultural content and the effect of such information on dry season agriculture practice among smallholder farmers in Nigeria's Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Participants consisted of 381 smallholder farmers selected from rural settlements in Kuje and Kwali Area councils, through a multi-stage sampling procedure. Data for the study was generated via a self-designed questionnaire. The findings of this study show that access to the broadcast media agricultural content is high (94.2%) in the FCT and the majority (83.1%) of the farmers are particularly exposed to agricultural programmes on dry season farming. However, the regularity of exposure to such programmes is considered rare/occasional by a sizable proportion (44.8%) of the selected farmers. The research further confirms the general acceptability of the broadcast programmes on dry season agriculture but the major snag is that the majority (>50%) of the farmers think that the time at which the information is broadcast is inappropriate. In terms of the practical implications of the programmes, findings also revealed that <50% of the respondents believe that exposure to broadcast media content on dry season farming has helped them to improve their knowledge of dry season farming practices. Nonetheless, most respondents (>50%) remain adamant that dry-season farming is not achievable and productive; therefore, they have not engaged in dry season irrigation agriculture. We concluded that the knowledge gained from the dry season agricultural programmes in the broadcast media is not sufficient for farmers to successfully engage in dry season irrigation farming. The study recommends a long-term and sustained media campaign on dry season farming, the use of interactive programme content, and rescheduling agricultural programmes to farmers' preferred time could yield the desired impact on dry season irrigation farming and food security in Nigeria.

Discussions revealed a low concern about SWQ in general, and in particular about microbial contamination. Participants identified behaviours that threaten SWQ, barriers to changing behaviour and suggestions for inducing change. A strong desire was expressed for water quality information to be interpreted and communicated in terms of how SWQ may impact human health and how their actions should be altered in response to test results. The information can be used to inform communication strategies and possibly impact policies associated with water quality testing and implementation of new tests. More broadly, awareness of the public's understanding and beliefs about source water can be used in working with the public to adopt water-friendly behaviours, influence the content and methods of communicating with the public about water issues and water quality, and could contribute to the direction of future research and investment into water technologies to align with the public's priorities.

Neuromorphic vision: From sensors to event-based algorithms	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Review						localization and mapping; object recognition; tracking; silicon retina	DRIVEN; PIXEL; ODOMETRY; TRACKING; TIME	Regardless of the marvels brought by the conventional frame-based cameras, they have significant drawbacks due to their redundancy in data and temporal latency. This causes problem in applications where low-latency transmission and high-speed processing are mandatory. Proceeding along this line of thought, the neurobiological principles of the biological retina have been adapted to accomplish data sparsity and high dynamic range at the pixel level. These bio-inspired neuromorphic vision sensors alleviate the more serious bottleneck of data redundancy by responding to changes in illumination rather than to illumination itself. This paper reviews in brief one such representative of neuromorphic sensors, the activity-driven event-based vision sensor, which mimics human eyes. Spatio-temporal encoding of event data permits incorporation of time correlation in addition to spatial correlation in vision processing, which enables more robustness. Henceforth, the conventional vision algorithms have to be reformulated to adapt to this new generation vision sensor data. It involves design of algorithms for sparse, asynchronous, and accurately timed information. Theories and new researches have begun emerging recently in the domain of event-based vision. The necessity to compile the vision research carried out in this sensor domain has turned out to be considerably more essential. Towards this, this paper reviews the state-of-the-art event-based vision algorithms by categorizing them into three major vision applications, object detection/recognition, object tracking, localization and mapping.

Pakistan is the world's sixth most populous country with a stroke-vulnerable population and is without a single dedicated chronic care center. In order to provide evidence for a viable solution responsive to this health care gap, and leveraging the existing >70 % mobile phone density, we thought it rational to test the effectiveness of a mobile phone-based video intervention of short 5-minute movies to educate and support stroke survivors and their primary caregivers. Methods: Movies4Stroke will be a randomized control, outcome assessor blinded, parallel group, single center superiority trial. Participants with an acute stroke, medically stable, with mild to moderate disability and having a stable primary caregiver will be included. After obtaining informed consent the stroke survivor-caregiver dyad will be randomized. Intervention participants will have the movie program software installed in their phone, desktop, or Android device which will allow them to receive, view and repeat 5-minute videos on stroke-related topics at admission, discharge and first and third months after enrollment. The control arm will receive standard of care at an internationally accredited center with defined protocols. The primary outcome measure is medication adherence as ascertained by a locally validated Morisky Medication Adherence Scale and control of major risk factors such as blood pressure, blood sugar and blood cholesterol at 12 months post discharge. Secondary outcome measures are post-stroke complications and mortality, caregiver knowledge and change in functional outcomes after acute stroke at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Movies4Stroke is designed to enroll 300 participant dyads after inflating 10 % to incorporate attrition and noncompliance and has been powered at 95 % to detect a 15 % difference between intervention and usual care arm. Analysis will be done by the intention-to-treat principle. Discussion: Movies4Stroke is a randomized trial testing an application aimed at supporting caregivers and stroke survivors in a LMIC with no rehabilitation or chronic support systems.

The steepness of this 'roll-off' is approximated by the spectral exponent, which in invasively recorded neural populations reflects the balance of excitatory to inhibitory neural activity (E:I balance). Here, we first establish that the spectral exponent of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) recordings is highly sensitive to general (i.e., anaesthesia-driven) changes in E:I balance. Building on the EEG spectral exponent as a viable marker of E:I, we then demonstrate its sensitivity to the focus of selective attention in an EEG experiment during which participants detected targets in simultaneous audio-visual noise. In addition to these endogenous changes in E:I balance, EEG spectral exponents over auditory and visual sensory cortices also tracked auditory and visual stimulus spectral exponents, respectively. Individuals' degree of this selective stimulus-brain coupling in spectral exponents predicted behavioural performance. Our results highlight the rich information contained in 1/f-like neural activity, providing a window into diverse neural processes previously thought to be inaccessible in non-invasive human recordings.

J	Singer, MA				Singer, Michael A.			Insights into Biomedicine from Animal Adaptations	COMPREHENSIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							LEFT-VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY; BLOOD-PRESSURE; HONEY-BEE; GENE-EXPRESSION; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS; APIS-MELLIFERA; SOCIAL-ROLE; SENESCENCE	Evolution represents a natural experimental process for testing animal design features. Driven by environmental pressures, animals have evolved adaptations which can give valuable insights into human biomedical conditions. The giraffe by virtue of its extremely long neck has a mean arterial pressure much higher than other mammals. However, the giraffe does not develop vascular damage or heart failure despite its high mean arterial pressure. The giraffe's cardiovascular physiology challenges a number of current concepts concerning the genesis of hypertensive vascular damage in the human. All animals senesce, and, in general, the manifestations of this senescence are similar to the aging features observed in humans. The characteristics of aging in natural animals strongly suggest that the so-called chronic degenerative diseases of humans are not really diseases but actually manifestations of the aging phenotype. Glucose regulation in birds and the naked mole rat has features which mimic the characteristics of the diabetic state, yet these animals do not develop the complications occurring in humans with diabetes. Disruptions in the functioning of the circadian molecular clock are thought to underlie certain neuropsychiatric disorders. The honeybee and the zebrafish have emerged as natural animal models for studying the regulation of molecular clocks and the mechanisms underlying plasticity of circadian rhythms. These examples underscore the valuable insights that natural animals can furnish with respect to biomedical disorders. Yet, this information data base remains a largely untapped resource.

Zika virus disease entered the Caribbean in 2013 with increased reporting of cases across the region in 2016, affecting more than 50 countries. This study aimed to ascertain the knowledge of, attitudes and practices towards Zika virus disease among antenatal clinic attenders in Trinidad and Tobago during the 2016 outbreak. Study design: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was undertaken. Methods: A knowledge attitudes and practices survey was conducted among antenatal clinic attenders at publicly funded primary care health centres. All counties of Trinidad (except St Patrick, Caroni and Victoria) and Tobago were included in the study. Within each county, three health centres were selected at random. At the antenatal clinic of each selected health centre, antenatal clients were selected by randomly selecting their patient file from that days antenatal clinic patient files. Data collection occurred from September to November 2016. The knowledge, attitudes and practice survey was administered by an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The World Health Organization Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice surveys Zika virus disease and potential complications Resource pack was adapted for use as the data collection tool. All data collected were analysed using SPSS software, version 23. Tests with P-values less than 0.05 were deemed significant. Results: Seventy-four percent (74%) of responders did not think there was a link between sexual transmission and Zika. About 19% stated that abstaining could prevent Zika but only 6.6% actually practiced this. Seventy-six percent knew the risk of microcephaly, and this knowledge of the risk of microcephaly was found to be significantly associated with the number of weeks gestation. Less than 40% knew the risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Doctors at health centres followed by private doctors were the top two trusted information sources for responders. Responders thought that the government could spray insecticide, clean drains, educate community members and clean overgrown vacant lots of land. Conclusion: The government and healthcare workers need to reach specific target groups with accurate messages to minimize the associated morbidity and thereby safeguarding national and global health security.

J	Farr, WM; Fishbach, M; Ye, J; Holz, D				Farr, Will M.; Fishbach, Maya; Ye, Jiani; Holz, Daniel			A Future Percent-level Measurement of the Hubble Expansion at Redshift 0.8 with Advanced LIGO	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article							STARS	Simultaneous measurements of distance and redshift can be used to constrain the expansion history of the universe and associated cosmological parameters. Merging binary black hole (BBH) systems are standard sirens-their gravitational waveform provides direct information about the luminosity distance to the source. There is, however, a perfect degeneracy between the source masses and redshift; some nongravitational information is necessary to break the degeneracy and determine the redshift of the source. Here we suggest that the pair instability supernova (PISN) process, thought to be the source of the observed upper limit on the black hole mass in merging BBH systems at similar to 45 M-circle dot, imprints a mass scale in the population of BBH mergers and permits a measurement of the redshift-luminosity-distance relation with these sources. We simulate five years of BBH detections in the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors with a realistic BBH merger rate, mass distribution with smooth PISN cutoff, and measurement uncertainty. We show that after one year of operation at design sensitivity the BBH population can constrain H(z) to 6.1% at a pivot redshift z similar or equal to 0.8. After five years the constraint improves to 2.9%. If the PISN cutoff is sharp, the uncertainty is smaller by about a factor of two. This measurement relies only on general relativity and the presence of a mass scale that is approximately fixed or calibrated across cosmic time; it is independent of any distance ladder. Observations by future "third-generation" gravitational wave detectors, which can see BBH mergers throughout the universe, would permit subpercent cosmographical measurements to z greater than or similar to 4 within one month of observation.

J	Hayward, RSA; Guyatt, GH; Moore, KA; McKibbon, A; Carter, AO				Hayward, RSA; Guyatt, GH; Moore, KA; McKibbon, A; Carter, AO			Canadian physicians' attitudes about and preferences regarding clinical practice guidelines	CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL			English	Article							INTERNISTS	Objective: To assess Canadian physicians' confidence in, attitudes about and p Design: Cross-sectional, self-administered mailed survey. Participants: Stratified random sample of 3000 Canadian physicians; 1878 (62.6%) responded. Setting: Canada. Outcome measures: Physicians' use of various information sources; familiarity with and confidence in guidelines; attitudes about guidelines and their effect on medical care; rating of importance of guidelines and other sources of information in clinical decision-making; rating of importance of various considerations in deciding whether to adopt a set of guidelines; and rating of usefulness of different formats for presenting guidelines. Main results: In all, 52% of the respondents reported using guidelines at least monthly, substantially less frequently than traditional information sources. Most of the respondents expressed confidence in guidelines issued by various physician organizations, but 51% to 77% were not confident in guidelines issued by federal or provincial health ministries or by health insurance plans. The respondents were;generally positive about guidelines (e.g., over 50% strongly agreed that they are a convenient source of advice and good educational tools); however, 22% to 26% had concerns about loss of autonomy, the rigidity of guidelines and decreased satisfaction with medical practice. Endorsement by respected colleagues or major organizations was identified as very important by 78% and 62% of the respondents respectively in deciding whether to adopt a set of guidelines in their practice. User friendliness of the guidelines format was thought to be very important by 62%; short pamphlets, manuals summarizing a number of guidelines, journal articles and pocket cards summarizing guidelines were the preferred formats (identified as most useful by 50% to 62% of the respondents). Conclusions: Canadian physicians, although generally positive about guidelines and confident in those developed by clinicians, have not yet integrated the use of guidelines into; their practices to a large extent. Our results suggest that respected organizations and opinion leaders should be involved in the development of guidelines and that the acceptability of any proposed format and medium for guidelines presentation should be pretested.

J	Isidorov, V; Szoka, L; Nazaruk, J				Isidorov, Valery; Szoka, Lukasz; Nazaruk, Jolanta			Cytotoxicity of white birch bud extracts: Perspectives for therapy of tumours	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MEDICINAL-PLANTS; ANTICANCER; PRECURSORS; PROPOLIS	Birch buds (Gemmae Betulae) are widely used in Russian and Chinese traditional medicine mainly as a diuretic and diaphoretic agent but also as an antiseptic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic. Despite the long history of therapeutic use of birch buds in folk medicine, the existing information on their chemical composition and pharmacological effects is insufficient. This circumstance warrants further study of the chemistry and pharmacology of birch buds. The present study was designed to investigate (a) the chemical composition of buds from two species of white birch and (b) the in vitro cytotoxic effect of extracts from these sources on selected tumour cells. Extracts from Betula pubescens Ehrh. and Betula pendula Roth. buds were obtained using three different methods: carbon dioxide supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), washing of exudate covering whole buds, and extraction of milled buds with diethyl ether. The chemical composition of extracts was investigated by GC-MS. Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay, and cell proliferation was determined by [H-3]thymidine uptake in cancer cells and normal skin fibroblasts. The GC-MS investigation identified a total of 150 substances of different classes. The chemical composition of B. pubescens and B. pendula buds differed, with bud extracts from the former containing a relatively high quantity of sesquiterpenoids and flavonoids, while the main components of extracts from the latter were triterpenoids. The results of the biological assay indicated that birch bud extracts demonstrated time-and concentration-dependent and differential cytotoxicity. The highest cytotoxic activity demonstrated bud exudates and SFE extracts obtained from both Betula species. The rich chemical composition of birch buds suggests the possibility of a wider spectrum of biological activity than previously thought. Birch bud extracts could be a promising source of compounds with cytotoxic activity against various cancers.

In situ video monitoring reveals diel shifts in inter- and intra-specific predation on the American lobster	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article							HOMARUS-AMERICANUS; TETHERING EXPERIMENTS; BENTHIC RECRUITMENT; CANCER-MAGISTER; DUNGENESS CRAB; BLUE CRABS; FOOD WEBS; BODY-SIZE; ECOLOGY; HABITAT	We conducted tethering experiments in the field to evaluate day-night differences in the identity and frequency of predators encountered by the American lobster (Homarus americanus) in coastal Maine, USA. Separate daytime and nighttime deployments were conducted using tethered lobsters under infrared-illuminated video surveillance. Supplemental tethering trials without video surveillance provided further quantitative information on diel and size-specific predation patterns. We found crabs to be the most common predators during the day, whereas lobsters prevailed at night. Contrary to expectations, we measured higher predation rates at night than during the day, suggesting that nocturnal interactions with conspecifics may play a more important role in lobster population regulation than previously thought when lobster population densities are high and large predatory fish are rare. As large predatory groundfish have been depleted in the Gulf of Maine, lobster populations have reached historic highs, making density-dependent feedbacks such as cannibalism more likely.

J	White, MS; Maher, BA; Manschreck, TC				White, MS; Maher, BA; Manschreck, TC			Hemispheric specialization in schizophrenics with perceptual aberration	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						cerebral asymmetry; hemisphere specialization; perceptual aberration; schizophrenia	THOUGHT-DISORDER; SCHIZOTYPY; LATERALITY; ASYMMETRY; SYMPTOMS; STIMULI; MEMORY; TIME	Higher rates of left-handedness and atypical lateralization in schizophrenics paired with findings of morphological abnormalities in cerebral asymmetry suggest that the normal patterns of hemisphere specialization for processing verbal and spatial information may be anomalous in schizophrenics. The small number of studies that have addressed this question have produced inconsistent findings and varied with subtype diagnosis, gender, type of task employed, task difficulty; and control of handedness. Conflicting research findings also may be due to confounding from the heterogeneity of the schizophrenic construct and variability in clinical symptoms across patients, The present study was designed to control for factors that may have confounded earlier studies. Because the study used perceptual measures, the relationship between symptoms of perceptual aberration and hemisphere advantages was examined using Chapman et al.'s (1978) Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS). Fifteen male schizophrenic patients and 14 male controls were administered tachistoscopic letter and facial recognition go/no-go reaction time tasks, Left hemisphere advantages were found for both controls and schizophrenics on the letter task. Right hemisphere advantages were found for controls on the facial task but not schizophrenics. Instead, a strong negative correlation was found between schizophrenics' PAS scores and hemisphere advantages (r = -0.685, p<0.007). Further analysis identified a subgroup of schizophrenics with perceptual aberration who exhibited reversed left hemisphere advantages that increased as the PAS scores increased. Additional research is needed to determine whether this subgroup of schizophrenics constitutes a meaningful subtype with a distinct disease process that disrupts the development of normal cerebral lateralization. The findings provide further evidence for the importance of examining relationships between schizophrenics' performance on cognitive measures and their symptom patterns.

Temperature Effects on Pea Plants Probed by Simultaneous Measurements of the Kinetics of Prompt Fluorescence, Delayed Fluorescence and Modulated 820 nm Reflection	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CHLOROPHYLL-A FLUORESCENCE; CHLOROPLAST THYLAKOID MEMBRANES; PHOTOSYSTEM-II; IN-VIVO; BARLEY LEAVES; CHARGE ACCUMULATION; ELECTRON-TRANSPORT; THERMAL-STABILITY; LIGHT-EMISSION; INDUCTION	Simultaneous in vivo measurements of prompt fluorescence (PF), delayed fluorescence (DF) and 820-nm reflection (MR) were made to probe response of pea leaves to 40 s incubation at high temperatures (25-50 degrees C). We interpret our observation to suggest that heat treatment provokes an inhibition of electron donation by the oxygen evolving complex. DF, in a time range from several microseconds to milliseconds, has been thought to reflect recombination, in the dark, between the reduced primary electron acceptor Q(A)(-) and the oxidized donor (P680(+)) of photosystem II (PSII). The lower electron transport rate through PSII after 45 and 50 degrees C incubation also changed DF induction. We observed a decrease in the amplitude of the DF curve and a change in its shape and in its decay. Acceleration of P700(+) and PC+ re-reduction was induced by 45 degrees C treatment but after 50 degrees C its reduction was slower, indicating inhibition of photosystem I. We suggest that simultaneous PF, MR and DF might provide useful information on assessing the degree of plant tolerance to different environmental stresses.

They are here applied to support the review of (1) political and management instruments and (2) elements that characterize the Bahia de Cadiz Nature Park (Spain). The latter objective is sustained by the DPSIR (Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) framework. A first DPSI conceptual map offers a broader view of the park capturing a range of elements that act at global, national and regional levels. Next, through expert consultation, prioritized DPSI issues describing the current situation of Bahia de Cadiz Nature Park are highlighted. A second DPSI map is designed to explore specific land-use and land-cover changes and their effects on the park's ecological integrity, offering a greater level of detail. 'Responses' are discussed separately, through a review of most recent response actions that have originated at various levels, and future ones proposed by the park's management. The framework proves to be appropriate to identify elements from both social and environmental dimensions, but excludes global-scale elements that do not fit the scope of this analysis. The review hopes to support future integrated research initiatives, involving in-depth analysis though the use of tools as are indicators or models.

However it remains unclear whether antagonistic mechanisms differentially modulate processing of spatial information within the hippocampus. We used fMRI and a virtual reality 3D paradigm to study encoding and retrieval of spatial memory during active visuospatial navigation, requiring positional encoding and retrieval of object landmarks during the path. Both encoding and retrieval elicited BOLD activation of the posterior most portion of hippocampus, while concurrent deactivations (recently shown to reflect decreases in neural responses) were found in the most anterior regions. Encoding elicited stronger activity in the posterior right than the left hippocampus. The former structure also showed significantly stronger activity for allocentric vs. egocentric processing during retrieval. The anterior vs. posterior pattern mimics, from a functional point, although at much distinct temporal scales, the previous anatomical findings in London taxi drivers, whereby posterior enlargement was found at the cost of an anterior decrease, and the mirror symmetric findings observed in blind people, in whom the right anterior hippocampus was found to be larger, at the cost of a smaller posterior hippocampus, as compared with sighted people. In sum, we found a functional dichotomy whereby the anterior/posterior hippocampus shows antagonistic processing patterns for spatial encoding and retrieval of 3D spatial information. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting such a dynamical pattern in a functional study, which suggests that differential modulation of neural responses within the human hippocampus reflects distinct roles in spatial memory processing.

And type II kinase inhibitors that target inactive conformation of kinases have attracted particular attention since their potency and selectivity are thought to be easier to achieve compared with their counterpart type I inhibitors that target active conformation of kinases. Although mechanisms underlying the interactions between type II inhibitors and their targeting kinases have been widely studied, there are still some challenging problems, for example, how type II inhibitors associate with or dissociate from their targeting kinases. In this investigation, steered molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out to explore the possible dissociation pathways of typical type II inhibitor imatinib from its targeting protein kinases c-Kit and Abl. The simulation results indicate that the most favorable pathway for imatinib dissociation corresponds to the ATP-channel rather than the relatively wider allosteric-pocket-channel, which is mainly due to the different van der Waals interaction that the ligand suffers during dissociation. Nevertheless, the direct reason comes from the fact that the residues composing the ATP-channel are more flexible than that forming the allosteric-pocket-channel.

J	Fujimi, T; Fujimura, K				Fujimi, Toshio; Fujimura, Kodai			Testing public interventions for flash flood evacuation through environmental and social cues: The merit of virtual reality experiments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Evacuation; Virtual reality; Flood; Experiment; Behavioral intervention	DECISION-MAKING; RISK PERCEPTION; PROTECTION MOTIVATION; TUNNEL EVACUATION; FIRE EMERGENCY; HUMAN-BEHAVIOR; FEAR APPEALS; EXIT SIGNS; INFORMATION; CHOICE	People often hesitate to evacuate their homes even when facing imminent danger from natural disasters. In particular, flash flood is one of most difficult disasters for people to evacuate because of its rapid onset and destructive features. This study proposed two public interventions to encourage early evacuation decisions from flash floods by changing environmental or social situations at the time recommended for evacuation. The first intervention involves designing a river cross section for signaling flash flood risk in the landscape. The second intervention requires predetermined members of the community to initiate an evacuation at a recommended time when in danger of a flash flood. These interventions were designed to rely on people's intuitive judgement rather than deliberative thinking. To examine the effects of these interventions, we conducted randomized controlled trials using virtual reality (VR) where each participant was randomly assigned to one of the five scenarios: two control scenarios and three treatment scenarios that include the first, second, and combined interventions, respectively. In the VR experiment, time of evacuation decision was measured under each scenario. The participants of this study were 103 students recruited from Kumamoto University in Japan. The results revealed that the participants reacted to the environmental and social cues provided using VR. The interventions were effective in promoting early evacuation decisions. These findings suggest that effective interventions can be designed and empirically examined using VR experiments to promote evacuation during natural disasters.

In control theory, Bayesian estimators are usually implemented using high-level representations. In this work, we designed a new spike-based computational model of a Bayesian estimator. The state estimator receives spiking activity from two neural populations encoding the sensory feedback and the cerebellar prediction, and it continuously computes the spike variability within each population as a reliability index of the signal these populations encode. The state estimator output encodes the current state estimate. We simulated a reaching task at different stages of cerebellar learning. The activity of the sensory feedback neurons encoded a noisy version of the trajectory after actual movement, with an almost constant intrapopulation spiking variability. Conversely, the activity of the cerebellar output neurons depended on the phase of the learning process. Before learning, they fired at their baseline not encoding any relevant information, and the variability was set to be higher than that of the sensory feedback (more reliable, albeit delayed). When learning was complete, their activity encoded the trajectory before the actual execution, providing an accurate sensory prediction; in this case, the variability was set to be lower than that of the sensory feedback. The state estimator model optimally integrated the neural activities of the afferent populations, so that the output state estimate was primarily driven by sensory feedback in prelearning and by the cerebellar prediction in postlearning. It was able to deal even with more complex scenarios, for example, by shifting the dominant source during the movement execution if information availability suddenly changed. The proposed tool will be a critical block within integrated spiking, brain-inspired control systems for simulations of sensorimotor tasks.

J	Lee, DT; Bruck, J				Lee, David T.; Bruck, Jehoshua			Algorithms for Generating Probabilities with Multivalued Stochastic Relay Circuits	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS			English	Article						Multiple valued logics; random number generation; stochastic relays		The problem of random number generation dates back to Von Neumann's work in 1951. Since then, many algorithms have been developed for generating unbiased bits from complex correlated sources as well as for generating arbitrary distributions from unbiased bits. An equally interesting, but less studied aspect is the structural component of random number generation. That is, given a set of primitive sources of randomness, and given composition rules induced by a device or nature, how can we build networks that generate arbitrary probability distributions? In this paper, we study the generation of arbitrary probability distributions in multivalued relay circuits, a generalization in which relays can take on any of N states and the logical 'and' and 'or' are replaced with 'min' and 'max' respectively. These circuits can be thought of as modeling the timing of events which depend on other event occurences. We describe a duality property and give algorithms that synthesize arbitrary rational probability distributions. We prove that these networks are robust to errors and design a universal probability generator which takes input bits and outputs any desired binary probability distribution.

J	Zhang, C; Wang, H; Wang, H; Wu, MH				Zhang, Chi; Wang, Hong; Wang, Hong; Wu, Mian-Hong			EEG-based expert system using complexity measures and probability density function control in alpha sub-band	INTEGRATED COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING			English	Article						Expert system; EEG; sample entropy; Lempel-Ziv complexity; PDF control	STOCHASTIC-SYSTEMS; OUTPUT PDFS; BRAIN; DIAGNOSIS; DESIGN; OSCILLATIONS; METHODOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; LEVEL; TASK	This paper presents a novel expert system based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and demonstrates the process of knowledge acquisition and inference. As we known, the problem-solving mode of expert brains is: They judge the current situation (learn about the problem), and then generate operational decisions to solve problems. However, the experts have difficulty in explaining what they know and how they gain the knowledge. Their perfect performance may be difficult to replicate. The EEG signal may be one of the most predictive and reliable measurements to acquire the expert knowledge as it reflects directly human brain activity. It is supposed that EEG is a manifestation of the experts' thinking. By the analysis of EEG, we found the regularity of EEG features of the experts in a well-defined problem domain and used the features to reflect the learning and decision-making information of the expert brains to establish the EEG-based expert system. The knowledge base of the EEG-based expert system stores the features that reflect the learning and decision-making activities of the expert brains respectively. Based on the relationship between the two kinds of the EEG features, inference engine of the EEG-based expert system makes an inference to obtain the features that reflect the decisions of the experts. When we encounter the same problem, the brains make the same judgement (learning). After the EEG data acquisition, through the EEG-based expert system, we can get the expert decisions (operations). If we interpret the decisions into actual operations or control, we can solve the problem with the expert performance or control machines more intelligently. In this paper, game experiments have been designed. We used the solution to the operation problem of a game as the basis to establish the model of the EEG-based expert system. The inputs of the system are the collected EEG signals of the users. The outputs are the operations (decisions) of the experts. The results of the EEG analysis show that the activity appeared in the corresponding brain regions and the probability density function (PDF) of the EEG features is concentrated when the experts performed the task (playing the game). By using the sample entropy (SampEn) and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) algorithm, the EEG features of the experts' learning activities and operating activities were extracted respectively. Then, with applying the probability density functions of the features to output PDF control, the mathematical model of the EEG-based expert system was established. In the EEG-based expert system, inference means controlling the feature vectors which reflect the users' learning information from the current situation to get the feature vectors which reflect the operating information of the experts. Finally, the expert system model has been tested on a simulated example and encouraging results have been obtained. The EEG-based expert system can forecast the operating features of the experts. The output of the EEG-based expert system is in accord with the expert mode and the operating curve represented by the physiological signal features can reflect the actual operating information.

There is little guidance about how to use surveys in decision-making. This article provides guidance for how to appraise and use a survey to answer health care questions. Study Design and Setting: A guidance article about the use a survey of a selected sample of people, who completed a self-report tool about their knowledge, beliefs and opinions, behaviors and experiences, or personal attributes. We use survey examples, one scenario, and a specific survey for illustration. Results: Decision makers should consider the credibility and applicability of the results of a survey. Key threats to credibility depend on the representativeness of the population and likelihood that it provides an accurate picture of the population's knowledge, attitudes, or self reported practices. If survey investigators do not use rigorous strategies to develop or pretest questions, there is a greater risk that results will be misleading. Decision makers may want to consider the precision of estimates and whether it would change their decisions. Finally, they need to decide how similar the surveyed population is to their specific population before applying results. Conclusions: Decision makers can follow this guidance to critically appraise, interpret, and apply the results of surveys to health care questions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Nurses are the main users of alarms in health care and their behaviors for alarm management influence the occurrence of alarm fatigue. Objectives: This qualitative research aimed to explore strategies used by nurses in dealing with nurses' alarm fatigue in the intensive care unit (ICU). Design: Qualitative research was carried out. Eighteen nurses working in ICUs were selected purposefully and were invited to take part in individual semi-structured interviews. Collected data were analyzed using content analysis for developing categories and subcategories. Setting: Twelve ICUs in ten hospitals in four urban areas of Iran. Results: The research's main category was "smart care " consisting of two categories of "technologic actions " and "non-technologic actions. " Also, six subcategories were developed: "identifying the cause and taking timely actions ", "personalized alarm settings ", "reducing the number of unnecessary alarms ", "effective teamwork ", "improving the physical environment and ward arrangement ", and "self-calmness ". Conclusion: Smart care by nurses included a set of active and proactive interventions developed through thinking and reflection and the use of information, skills, and experiences in order to manage exposure to alarm fatigue. Strategies used by nurses to prevent alarm fatigue can reduce the physical and psychological burden caused by frequent exposure to alarms in the ICU and consequently can have direct impacts on the quality and safety of nursing care.

Reducing P pollution risk in agricultural catchments is challenging due to the complexity of biophysical drivers along the source-mobilisation-delivery-impact continuum. While there is a need for place-specific interventions, the evidence supporting the likely effectiveness of mitigation measures and their spatial targeting is uncertain. We developed a decision-support tool using a Bayesian Belief Network that facilitates system-level thinking about P pollution and brings together academic and stakeholder communities to co-construct a model appropriate to the region of interest. The expert-based causal model simulates the probability of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration falling into the WFD high/good or moderate/poor status classifications along with the effectiveness of three mitigation measures including buffer strips, fertiliser input reduction and septic tank management. In addition, critical source areas of pollution are simulated on 100 x 100 m raster grids for seven catchments (12-134 km(2)) representative of the hydroclimatic and land use intensity gradients in Scotland. Sensitivity analysis revealed the importance of fertiliser inputs, soil Morgan P, eroded SRP delivery rate, presence/absence of artificial drainage and soil erosion for SRP losses from diffuse sources, while the presence/absence of septic tanks, farmyards and the design size of sewage treatment works were influential variables related to point sources. Model validation confirmed plausible model performance as a "fit for purpose " decision support tool. When compared to observed water quality data, the expert-based causal model simulated a plausible probability of GES, with some differences between study catchments. Reducing fertiliser inputs below optimal agronomic levels increased the probability of GES by 5%, while management of septic tanks increased the probability of GES by 8%. Conversely, implementation of riparian buffers did not have an observable effect on the probability of GES at the catchment outlet. The main benefit of the approach was the ability to integrate diverse, and often sparse, information; account for uncertainty and easily integrate new data and knowledge.

Weather Warning Uncertainty: High Severity Influences Judgment Bias	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY			English	Article							INTENSITY; FORECASTS; TRACK; RISK	Information about hurricanes changes as the storm approaches land. Additionally, people tend to think that severe events are more likely to occur even if the probability of that event occurring is the same as a less severe event. Thus, holding probability constant, this research tested the influence of severity on storm judgments in the context of updates about the approaching storm's severity. In two studies, participants watched one of four (experiment 1) or one of five (experiment 2) sequences of updating hurricane warnings. The position of category 1 and category 5 hurricane warnings in the sequences varied (e.g., category 1 first and category 5 last, or category 5 first and category 1 last). After the videos, participants made judgments about the approaching storm. In experiment 1, participants generally overestimated the threat of the storm if they saw a category 5 hurricane warning in any position. Experiment 2, designed to test whether experiment 1 results were due to a contrast effect, revealed a similar pattern to experiment 1. Overall, when participants saw a category 5 hurricane warning, they anchored to severity regardless of updates that the storm had decreased in severity. Importantly, however, the extent of anchoring to severity depended on the type of judgment participants made. In terms of policy, the study proposes that weather warning agencies focus on message content at least as much as they focus on message accuracy.

J	Lee, J; Napadow, V; Park, K				Lee, Jeungchan; Napadow, Vitaly; Park, Kyungmo			Pain and sensory detection threshold response to acupuncture is modulated by coping strategy and acupuncture sensation	BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						Coping strategy; Acupuncture; Acupuncture sensation; Pain; Sensory threshold	OPIOID-INDUCED HYPERALGESIA; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; NEEDLING SENSATION; ANALGESIA; FMRI; ELECTROACUPUNCTURE; STIMULATION; VOLUNTEERS; PERCEPTION; PREDICTOR	Background: Acupuncture has been shown to reduce pain, and acupuncture-induced sensation may be important for this analgesia. In addition, cognitive coping strategies can influence sensory perception. However, the role of coping strategy on acupuncture modulation of pain and sensory thresholds, and the association between acupuncture sensation and these modulatory effects, is currently unknown. Methods: Electroacupuncture (EA) was applied at acupoints ST36 and GB39 of 61 healthy adults. Different coping conditions were experimentally designed to form an active coping strategy group (AC group), who thought they could control EA stimulation intensity, and a passive coping strategy group (PC group), who did not think they had such control. Importantly, neither group was actually able to control EA stimulus intensity. Quantitative sensory testing was performed before and after EA, and consisted of vibration (VDT), mechanical (MDT), warm (WDT), and cold (CDT) detection thresholds, and pressure (PPT), mechanical (MPT), heat (HPT) and cold (CPT) pain thresholds. Autonomic measures (e. g. skin conductance response, SCR) were also acquired to quantify physiological response to EA under different coping conditions. Subjects also reported the intensity of any acupuncture-induced sensations. Results: Coping strategy was induced with successful blinding in 58% of AC subjects. Compared to PC, AC showed greater SCR to EA. Under AC, EA reduced PPT and CPT. In the AC group, improved pain and sensory thresholds were correlated with acupuncture sensation (VDTchange vs. MI: r=0.58, CDTchange vs. tingling: r=0.53, CPTchange vs. tingling; r=0.55, CPTchange vs. dull; r=0.55). However, in the PC group, improved sensory thresholds were negatively correlated with acupuncture sensation (CDTchange vs. intensity sensitization: r=-0.52, WDTchange vs. fullness: r=-0.57). Conclusions: Our novel approach was able to successfully induce AC and PC strategies to EA stimulation. The interaction between psychological coping strategy and acupuncture sensation intensity can differentially modulate pain and sensory detection threshold response to EA. In a clinical context, our findings suggest that instructions given to the patient can significantly affect therapeutic outcomes and the relationship between acupuncture intensity and clinical response. Specifically, acupuncture analgesia can be enhanced by matching physical stimulation intensity with psychological coping strategy to acupuncture contexts.

We investigated implicit regularity extraction for acoustically intact versus disrupted six-tone sound patterns via event-related potentials (ERPs). In an exact-repetition condition, identical patterns were repeated; in two distorted-repetition conditions, one randomly chosen segment in each sound pattern was replaced either by white noise or by a wrong pitch. In a roving-standard paradigm, sound patterns were repeated 1-12 times (standards) in a row before a new pattern (deviant) occurred. The participants were not informed about the roving rule and had to detect rarely occurring loudness changes. Behavioral detectability of pattern changes was assessed in a subsequent behavioral task. Pattern changes (standard vs. deviant) elicited mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a, and were behaviorally detected above the chance level in all conditions, suggesting that the auditory system extracts regularities despite distortions in the acoustic input. However, MMN and P3a amplitude were decreased by distortions. At the level of MMN, both types of distortions caused similar impairments, suggesting that auditory regularity extraction is largely determined by the stimulus statistics of matching information. At the level of P3a, wrong-pitch distortions caused larger decreases than white-noise distortions. Wrong-pitch distortions likely prevented the engagement of restoration mechanisms and the segregation of disrupted from true pattern segments, causing stronger informational interference with the relevant pattern information.

We focus on auditory perception of temporal order and address the following questions: (1) do subjects' age, gender, hearing status and cognitive functioning influence temporal ordering abilities; (2) are there any differences between Polish and German subjects on these abilities? Methods: 86 Polish and 82 German subjects aged from 20 to 69 years were classified into 5 age groups. Subjects identified the order of two 1-ms clicks presented monaurally in rapid succession. The temporal order threshold (i.e. the minimum temporal gap required to report the stimulus order at 75% correctness) was assessed for each individual. Results: There were no differences between Polish and German subjects on temporal ordering. In both samples, a significant prolongation of temporal-order threshold was observed in subjects older than 60 years of age. Temporal processing was relatively resistant to subjects' hearing status, but it depended on cognitive competence. Thus, it is not chronological age as such but cognitive competence that may explain age-related decreases of temporal acuity. Furthermore, potential effects of age or gender are robust against the language background as no differences were observed between Polish and German subjects. Conclusions: We propose the existence of a neural mechanism underlying the perception of rapid changes in non-verbal acoustic features which constitute a frame for speech perception in many languages. This finding may be important with respect to future applications of temporal training in speech therapy programs designed for patients with receptive language disorders of different etiologies.

A Comprehensive Reflective Journal-Writing Framework for Pharmacy Students to Increase Self-Awareness and Develop Actionable Goals	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						reflection; student experiences; assessment; self-awareness; co-curriculum	CRITICAL THINKING	Objective. To develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a structured model for reflective journal writing (RJW) and a grading rubric as part of a student portfolio designed to help Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students create actionable goals. Methods. A structured, eight-domain format was developed to engage students in prioritization, identification, exploration, recollection, evaluation, and challenging/solidifying their own knowledge, while assembling an action plan for development (abbreviated using the acronym PIE-RECAP). After completing RJW using this model, students self-identified domains established by the Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Education (CAPE) that corresponded to their entries. A grading rubric was designed and normalized to require minimal training for use. RJW and other elements of student portfolios were implemented simultaneously across three cohorts (N5296). Twenty-one faculty and staff graders each evaluated 10 to 15 student journal entries. Results. Of 771 journal entries, 648 (84%) met expectations, while 123 (16%) needed to be rewritten. Students identified experiences that were meaningful to them and shared in their RJW entry the knowledge and/or information that they did not know prior to the experience. Common themes identified in the students' RJWs included: curricular experiences (12.7%), cocurricular experiences (18.4%), and experiential training (68.6%). Conclusion. The PIE-RECAP method can be used to guide students in RJW and identify CAPE domains in their personal and professional experiences in pharmacy school. The associated grading rubric can be used to evaluate students' RJW entries and assess their growth in curricular, cocurricular and affective domains relative to their progression.

Objectives This study aimed to further our understanding of leisure horse owners' perceptions of equine health and awareness of excess fat in order to clarify our understanding of successful strategies for managing equine weight. Study design This study used a qualitative research methodology. Methods Data comprised 16 threads from online UK equine discussion fora, 28 individual interviews with leisure horse owners, 19 interviews with equine professionals such as vets and nutritionists, and two focus groups with a further 21 horse owners. Data were anonymised and analysed using a grounded theory approach. Results Awareness of excess fat was a complex issue, with owners finding it difficult to differentiate equine obesity from the shape they thought the horse was "meant to be", particularly if the horse was a heavier breed such as a native pony or cob. Owners were not necessarily "aware" or "unaware" of fat, but instead equine body fat was constructed as an integral part of the equine body. For example, owners might say that they thought their horse was an ideal weight yet describe their horse's overall body shape as "like a Thelwell". When owners became aware of fat as a changeable part of the horse's body, and/or a threat to health, the presence of fat was articulated as a strong-willed adversary, and weight management was considered a "battle" or "war". Owners found weight management difficult because they perceived that it had immediate negative welfare implications for the horse, and this therefore interfered with their preferred ownership practices and the horse-human relationship. Main limitations Interview data are self-reported, and people may not always do what they say they do. Conclusions This study has provided valuable insight into how owners conceptualise weight and weight management, yielding important information about communicating with owners about weight, tailoring weight management strategies, and promoting positive welfare.

The effects of four types of enrichment on feather-pecking behaviour in laying hens housed in barren environments	ANIMAL WELFARE			English	Article						animal welfare; chicken; enrichment; feather pecking; motivation; stereotypic behaviour	WOOD SHAVINGS; CANNIBALISM; EXPERIENCE; ACCESS; DAMAGE; FORM	Severe feather pecking, a potentially stereotypic behaviour in chickens (Gallus gallus), can be reduced by providing enrichment. However, there is little comparative information available on the effectiveness of different types of enrichment. Providing forages to birds is likely to decrease feather-pecking behaviour the most, as it is generally thought that feather pecking stems from re-directed foraging motivation. Yet, other types of enrichment, such as dustbaths and novel objects, have also been shown to reduce feather pecking. In order to develop a practical and effective enrichment, these different possibilities must be examined. Using a Latin Square Design, 14-week old birds were given each of four treatments: i) forages; ii) novel objects; iii) dustbaths; or iv) no enrichment. The amount of feather-pecking behaviour and the number of pecks to the enrichments were recorded. Results showed feather pecking to be highest when no enrichment was present and lowest when the forages were present, with the other two enrichments intermediate. This was despite the fact that the numbers of pecks birds gave to the forages and dustbaths were not significantly different, suggesting that they were similarly used. Thus, we suggest here that forage enrichments are most effective at alleviating feather pecking at least in the short term and attempts should be made to develop poultry housing that allows for natural foraging behaviour. Following this, providing any kind of enrichment will increase bird welfare and is therefore still beneficial.	[Dixon, L.

J	Uomoto, T; Mutsuyoshi, H; Katsuki, F; Misra, S				Uomoto, T; Mutsuyoshi, H; Katsuki, F; Misra, S			Use of fiber reinforced polymer composites as reinforcing material for concrete	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						fiber reinforced materials; concrete, reinforced; polymers; construction materials		Although the potential of continuous fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) was recognized more than 50 years ago, bottlenecks such as vulnerability to static fatigue, ultraviolet radiation, alkaline environment, etc., continued to restrict their use as a construction material. Extensive research across the world during approximately the last 25 years has led to a better understanding of properties and behavior of the FRPs under different conditions. Given their lightweight, noncorrosive, and nonmagnetic nature and their high tensile strength, FRP composites are being used as reinforcement in concrete, especially in prestressed concrete construction, anchors for slope stabilization, and use in special structures such as high-speed linear motor railway tracks, MRI units of hospitals, and repair and rehabilitation works. An attempt has been made in this paper to comprehensively put together the various aspects of FRPs, including their structural and durability characteristics, the ongoing research in the areas related to their utilization as a reinforcing material for concrete structures, and the application of FRP sheets in rehabilitation of deteriorated concrete structures. Though issues related to the manufacture of FRP composites and design procedures have not been considered in detail, they have been included for information and completeness. The paper also presents the current thinking on the design and construction procedures using FRP material in conjunction with concrete and provides a brief discussion of some of the documented applications of FRP composites-rods and sheets-as reinforcement in concrete construction. It may also be mentioned that the paper is largely based on the case studies and research work carried out in Japan; appropriate references to related work in other parts of the world are also included, though in principle there is very little difference in the approaches being adopted across the world.

J	Chen, C; Vanclay, F				Chen, Chen; Vanclay, Frank			Transnational universities, host communities and local residents: social impacts, university social responsibility and campus sustainability	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Corporate social responsibility; Campus sustainability; Social impact assessment; University social responsibility; Social license to operate; University-community engagement	PROJECT-INDUCED DISPLACEMENT; HIGHER-EDUCATION; HUMAN-RIGHTS; ENGAGEMENT; LICENSE; OPERATE; FRAMEWORK; PARTICIPATION; MOTIVATIONS; CHALLENGES	Purpose This paper aims to discuss how transnational universities create negative and positive social impacts on their host communities and what this means for campus sustainability and the expectation that universities contribute to sustainable development and to their local communities. Design/methodology/approach Using mixed methods, a multiple case study approach and qualitative meta-analysis, this study considers six transnational university campuses in China in terms of their relationship with local communities. Findings Because of the good reputation of universities generally, local residents tended to accord a social licence to operate (i.e. approval) to new university campuses. However, universities generally do not manage their social impacts, as well as many other industries and generally fail to consider the corporate social responsibility issues and the environmental, social and governance aspects of their activities. To improve their social licence to operate and grow and to meet expectations around "university social responsibility", campus developments should observe key international principles and human rights standards: full disclosure of information; effective community engagement; appropriate resettlement and livelihood restoration; effective harm reduction procedures; provision of local benefits (benefit sharing); monitoring and adaptive management and implement a grievance redress mechanism. Originality/value This paper encourages broader thinking about sustainability in a higher education context and about what university social responsibility entails. Specifically, this study argues that the relationship between universities and their host communities also needs to be considered, especially during campus construction.

The underlying legal framework supports the achievement of ecological, social and economic objectives, but a national policy to fast track the oceans economy provides a challenge for ecosystem-based approaches to MSP. During the 2018 International Marine Conservation Congress, we convened a session to present particular challenges that will likely apply to any developing country seeking to increase profits from existing, or proposed, marine activities. Here we present six multi-disciplinary research projects that support ecosystem-based approaches to MSP in South Africa, by addressing the following knowledge gaps and specific key challenges: (1) the lack of data-derived measurements of ecosystem condition (and the need to validate commonly-used proxy measures); (2) the need to develop models to better understand the potential impacts of climate change on food webs and fisheries; (3) the slow implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management, and the need to implement existing legal instruments that can support such an approach; (4) the paucity of evidence supporting dynamic ocean management strategies; (5) the requirement to manage conflicting objectives in growing marine tourism industries; and (6) the need to adopt systems thinking approaches to support integrated ocean management. We provide examples of specific research projects designed to address these challenges. The ultimate goal of this research is to advance a more integrated approach to ocean management in South Africa, using tools that can be applied in countries with similar socio-political and environmental contexts.

Effect of In-Person vs Video Training and Access to All Functions vs a Limited Subset of Functions on Portal Use Among Inpatients A Randomized Clinical Trial	JAMA NETWORK OPEN			English	Article							SELF-MANAGEMENT; CHRONIC DISEASE; HOSPITALIZED-PATIENTS; PATIENT; INFORMATION; TECHNOLOGY; PROGRAMS; DELIVERY	IMPORTANCE Inpatient portals provide patients with clinical data and information about their care and have the potential to influence patient engagement and experience. Although significant resources have been devoted to implementing these portals, evaluation of their effects has been limited. OBJECTIVE To assess the effects of patient training and portal functionality on use of an inpatient portal and on patient satisfaction and involvement with care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial was conducted from December 15, 2016, to August 31, 2019, at 6 noncancer hospitals that were part of a single health care system. Patients who were at least 18 years of age, identified English as their preferred language, were not involuntarily confined or detained, and agreed to be provided a tablet to access the inpatient portal during their stay were eligible for participation. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2019, to March 15, 2021. INTERVENTIONS A 2 x 2 factorial intervention design was used to compare 2 levels of a training intervention (touch intervention, consisting of in-person training vs built-in video tutorial) and 2 levels of portal function availability (tech intervention) within an inpatient portal (all functions operational vs a limited subset of functions). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were inpatient portal use, measured by frequency and comprehensiveness of use, and patients' satisfaction and involvement with their care. RESULTS Of 2892 participants, 1641 were women (56.7%) with a median age of 47.0 (95% CI, 46.0-48.0) years. Most patients were White (2221 [76.8%]). The median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 1(95% CI, 1-1) and the median length of stay was 6 (95% CI, 6-7) days. Notably, the in-person training intervention was found to significantly increase inpatient portal use (incidence rate ratio, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.25-1.44]) compared with the video tutorial. Patients who received in-person training had significantly higher odds of being comprehensive portal users than those who received the video tutorial (odds ratio, 20.75 [95% CI. 16.49-26.10]). Among patients who received the full-tech intervention, those who also received the in-person intervention used the portal more frequently (incidence rate ratio, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.25-1.48]) and more comprehensively (odds ratio, 22.52; [95% CI, 17.13-29.62]) than those who received the video tutorial. Patients who received in-person training had higher odds (OR, 2.01[95% CI. 1.16-3.50]) of reporting being satisfied in the 6-month postdischarge survey. Similarly, patients who received the full-tech intervention had higher odds (OR, 2.06 [95%CI, 1.42-2.99]) of reporting being satisfied in the 6-month postdischarge survey. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Providing in-person training or robust portal functionality increased inpatient engagement with the portal during the hospital stay. The effects of the training intervention suggest that providing personalized training to support use of this health information technology can be a powerful approach to increase patient engagement via portals.

We sought to determine the food allergy perceptions and education needs of parents, students and school staff, with the goal of enhancing food allergy education in schools. Methods: With ethics approval from the University of Manitoba and participating school divisions, elementary school principals emailed SurveyMonkey (R) Questionnaire Links to their parent/caregiver contact list and school staff. We compared anonymous responses of parents of children with and without food allergy, students with and without food allergy, and parents and school staff using chi-squared tests. Results: Participants included 561 parents of school-age children (ages 7-12 years, 19% with food allergy), 61 students (23% with food allergy), and 203 school staff (62% teachers, 88% with experience managing food allergies in the classroom). Parents of children with and without food allergy considered food allergy when sending food to school (98% vs. 96%, p = 0.39). More parents of children with food allergy thought that greater information and awareness about food allergy was needed (74% vs. 44%, p <0.0001). Students with food allergy were most interested (100%) in having other students learn not to bully and how to help during a reaction. Students without food allergy were most interested in learning how to prevent a reaction (70%). Fewer parents than school staff thought that food allergies in the classroom impacted teachers'time (2.1% vs. 21%, p <0.0001) and that teachers knew how to treat allergic reactions to foods (34% vs. 94%, p < 0.0001). More parents than school staff thought that banning foods from classrooms kept allergic students safe (65% vs. 34%, p = 0.006) and that having a Food Allergy Educator speak at school would be helpful (99% vs. 67%, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Food allergy education is necessary for the entire school community and should include parents of school-aged children with and without food allergy, students with and without food allergy, and teachers and school staff. These members of the school community recognized their own and others' needs for increased food allergy education and awareness in the school setting.

Educational SMS text messages can reach large numbers of people, and studies suggest SNAP participants appreciate nutrition education and have access to mobile phones. Objective: Using a pre-post intervention design, we assessed the feasibility of, and program satisfaction and outcomes resulting from, the San Diego County, California SNAP agency sending monthly food and nutrition education SMS text messages to all SNAP participants to increase fruit and vegetable purchasing and consumption. Methods: We developed and sent 5 behavioral science-informed SMS text messages with links to a project website in English and Spanish with information about selecting, storing, and preparing seasonal fruits and vegetables. The San Diego County SNAP agency sent monthly texts to similar to 170,000 SNAP households from October 2020 to February 2021. SNAP participants completed web-based surveys in response to a text invitation from the SNAP agency in September 2020 (baseline, n=12,036) and April 2021 (follow-up, n=4927). Descriptive frequencies were generated, and adjusted multiple linear mixed models were run on a matched data set of participants that completed both baseline and follow-up surveys (n=875) assessing pre-or postattitudes, behaviors, knowledge, and self-efficacy. We used adjusted logistic regression models to assess differences between the matched (n=875) and nonmatched (n=4052) participants related to experiences with the intervention (questions asked only at follow-up). Results: After the intervention, matched participants reported significant increase in knowing where to get information about selecting, storing, and preparing fruits and vegetables (3.76 vs 4.02 on a 5-point Likert scale with 5=strongly agree, P<.001); feeling good about participating in SNAP (4.35 vs 4.43, P=.03); and thinking the CalFresh program helps them eat healthy (4.38 vs 4.48, P=.006). No significant pre-or postdifferences were found in fruit or vegetable consumption, though most participants at follow-up (n=1556, 64%) reported their consumption had increased. Among the sample that completed the follow-up survey only (n=4052, not including 875 participants who completed follow-up and baseline), 1583 (65%) and 1556 (64%) reported purchasing and eating more California-grown fruits and vegetables, respectively. Nearly all respondents appreciated the intervention (n=2203, 90%) and wanted it to continue (n=2037, 83%). Conclusions: SNAP can feasibly provide food and nutrition messages via text to participants. A monthly text campaign was well received by responding participants and improved some measures of their self-reported knowledge, self-efficacy, produce consumption, and perceptions of SNAP participation. Participants expressed interest in continuing to receive texts. While educational messages will not solve the complex food and nutrition challenges confronting SNAP participants, further work should employ rigorous methods to expand and test this intervention in other SNAP programs before considering to implement it at scale.

Aplanar transformer is thought to be particularly effective in a high-frequency switching power supply because an ideal primary-secondary interleave structure can be formed by the multi-layer structure, and the alternating-current (AC) resistance can be reduced. Based on these facts, we investigated the use of planar transformers in LLC converters. However, high-frequency oscillation, which is not observed in a normal winding transformer, appears in the secondary side current, and the power supply loss is also higher. Our investigation found that the current oscillation and an increase in loss were caused by a primary-secondary capacitance of the transformer. This paper presents countermeasures used to reduce the capacitance between the primary and secondary windings, and a new layer structure for the transformer that reduces the capacitance. The loss is calculated through a simulation and experimentally, and good agreement is obtained. The proposed transformer offers the high efficiency of 98.1% in a 200 W, 12 V output power supply.

Rethinking people's conceptions of mental life	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						mind perception; folk theories; animacy; agency; social cognition	MIND PERCEPTION; DEHUMANIZATION	How do people make sense of the emotions, sensations, and cognitive abilities that make up mental life? Pioneering work on the dimensions of mind perception has been interpreted as evidence that people consider mental life to have two core components-experience (e.g., hunger, joy) and agency (e.g., planning, self-control) [Gray HM, et al. (2007) Science 315: 619]. We argue that this conclusion is premature: The experience-agency framework may capture people's understanding of the differences among different beings (e.g., dogs, humans, robots, God) but not how people parse mental life itself. Inspired by Gray et al.'s bottom-up approach, we conducted four large-scale studies designed to assess people's conceptions of mental life more directly. This led to the discovery of an organization that differs strikingly from the experience-agency framework: Instead of a broad distinction between experience and agency, our studies consistently revealed three fundamental components of mental life-suites of capacities related to the body, the heart, and the mind-with each component encompassing related aspects of both experience and agency. This body-heart-mind framework distinguishes itself from Gray et al.'s experience-agency framework by its clear and importantly different implications for dehumanization, moral reasoning, and other important social phenomena.

Behavioral and neural evidence for masked conceptual priming of recollection	CORTEX			English	Article						Recollection; Familiarity; fMRI; Conceptual priming; Repetition priming	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; RECOGNITION MEMORY; FALSE RECOGNITION; PROCESSING FLUENCY; DECISION-PROCESSES; EPISODIC MEMORY; FAMILIARITY; RETRIEVAL; HIPPOCAMPUS; DISSOCIATIONS	Previous research has found that masked repetition primes, presented immediately prior to the test item in a recognition memory test, increase the likelihood that participants think that the item was present in a previous study phase, even if it was not. This memory illusion is normally associated with a feeling of familiarity, rather than recollection (e.g., as indexed by Remember/Know judgments), and has been explained in terms of an increased fluency of processing the test item, which, in the absence of awareness of the cause of that fluency (i.e., the masked prime), is attributed instead to prior exposure in the study phase. Recently however, we have found that masked conceptual primes (semantically rather than associatively related to the test item) have the opposite effect of increasing Remember but not Know judgments. This result appears difficult to explain in terms of existing theories of recollection and familiarity. Here we report data from a functional magnetic resonance imaging study using the same design, in which we replicate our previous behavioral findings, and find converging evidence for increased activity following conceptual primes in brain regions associated with recollection. This neural evidence supports an account in terms of "true" recollection (for example, conceptual primes reactivating semantically related information that was generated at encoding), rather than an artifact of the mutually-exclusive nature of the Remember/Know procedure.

Optical flow balance perturbations alter gait kinematics and variability in chronic ankle instability patients	GAIT & POSTURE			English	Article						Sensory reweighting; Vision; Dynamic postural control; CAI	POSTURAL CONTROL; RELIANCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; EXPERTISE; INJURIES; DEFICITS; WALKING; TRAUMA; STANCE	Background: Individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) have known balance impairments thought to be the result of an inability to reweight sensory information. CAI patients place greater emphasis on visual information during single-limb stance than healthy controls but this evidence is based on removing visual information during static conditions. Research question: Does perturbed optical flow effect step kinematics and variability in those with CAI differently than healthy controls? What is the relationship among ankle laxity, plantar cutaneous sensation, and susceptibility to perturbed optical flow in those with CAI? Methods: 17 CAI patients and 17 healthy individuals participated in a crossover experimental study. Participants walked on a treadmill at 1.25 m/s while watching a speed-matched virtual hallway with and without continuous mediolateral (ML) optical flow perturbations. Three-dimensional pelvic and foot kinematics were recorded at 100 Hz for at least 300 consecutive steps in each condition. Step width (SW) and step length (SL) values were calculated from consecutive heel positions. Gait variability was characterized as the standard deviation of step width (SWV), step length (SLV), and ML sacrum motion (SMV) across all steps performed in each condition. Results: The CAI group exhibited a greater change in SWV (p = 0.037), SLV (p = 0.040), and ML SMV (p = 0.047) from the perturbed to unperturbed conditions relative to the healthy controls. A condition main effect was also noted for SW (p < 0.001) and SL (p < 0.001) as ML optical flow perturbations resulted in significant changes in SW and SL relative to the normal walking condition. Significance: Walking with ML optical flow perturbations induced greater variability changes in those with CAI relative to controls. When combined with the existing literature, this finding suggests that CAI individuals have a greater reliance on visual information in both static and dynamic (i.e. walking gait) conditions relative to healthy individuals.

J	Kamila, S; Hasanuzzaman, M; Ekbal, A; Bhattacharyya, P				Kamila, Sabyasachi; Hasanuzzaman, Mohammad; Ekbal, Asif; Bhattacharyya, Pushpak			Resolution of grammatical tense into actual time, and its application in Time Perspective study in the tweet space	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TEMPORAL ORIENTATION; FUTURE ORIENTATION; PERSONALITY; INVENTORY; EMOTIONS; SMOKING	Time Perspective (TP) is an important area of research within the 'psychological time' paradigm. TP, or the manner in which individuals conduct themselves as a reflection of their cogitation of the past, the present, and the future, is considered as a basic facet of human functioning. These perceptions of time have an influence on our actions, perceptions, and emotions. Assessment of TP based on human language on Twitter opens up a new avenue for research on subjective view of time at a large scale. In order to assess TP of users' from their tweets, the foremost task is to resolve grammatical tense into the underlying temporal orientation of tweets as for many tweets the tense information, and their temporal orientations are not the same. In this article, we first resolve grammatical tense of users' tweets to identify their underlying temporal orientation: past, present, or future. We develop a minimally supervised classification framework for temporal orientation task that enables incorporating linguistic knowledge into a deep neural network. The temporal orientation model achieves an accuracy of 78.7% when tested on a manually annotated test set. This method performs better when compared to the state-of-the-art technique. Secondly, we apply the classification model to classify the users' tweets in either of the past, present or future categories. Tweets classified this way are then grouped for each user which gives rise to unidimensional TP. The valence (positive, negative, and neutral) is added to the temporal orientation dimension to produce the bidimensional TP. We finally investigate the association between the Twitter users' unidimensional and bidimensional TP and their age, education and six basic emotions in a large-scale empirical manner. Our analysis shows that people tend to think more about the past as well as more positive about the future when they age. We also observe that future-negative people are less joyful, more sad, more disgusted, and more angry while past-negative people have more fear.

LRRTM1 underlies synaptic convergence in visual thalamus	ELIFE			English	Article							LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; REPEAT TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEINS; RELAY CELLS; MOUSE; AXON; CPG15; GROWTH; NEUROLIGINS; MATURATION	It has long been thought that the mammalian visual system is organized into parallel pathways, with incoming visual signals being parsed in the retina based on feature (e.g. color, contrast and motion) and then transmitted to the brain in unmixed, feature-specific channels. To faithfully convey feature-specific information from retina to cortex, thalamic relay cells must receive inputs from only a small number of functionally similar retinal ganglion cells. However, recent studies challenged this by revealing substantial levels of retinal convergence onto relay cells. Here, we sought to identify mechanisms responsible for the assembly of such convergence. Using an unbiased transcriptomics approach and targeted mutant mice, we discovered a critical role for the synaptic adhesion molecule Leucine Rich Repeat Transmembrane Neuronal 1 (LRRTM1) in the emergence of retinothalamic convergence. Importantly, LRRTM1 mutant mice display impairment in visual behaviors, suggesting a functional role of retinothalamic convergence in vision.

Methods This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on two neonatal intensive care units of two hospitals over 3 months. Demographic information, drug information and total number of prescriptions for each neonate were extracted from medical records and assessed. Results A total of 688 prescriptions for 44 types of drugs were checked for the assessment of medical records of 155 neonates. There were 509 medication errors, averaging (SD) 3.38 (+/- 5.49) errors per patient. Collectively, 116 neonates (74.8%) experienced at least one medication error. Term neonates and preterm neonates experienced 125 and 384 medication errors, respectively. The most frequent medication errors were wrong dosage by physicians in prescription phase [WU1] (142 errors; 28%) and not administering medication by nurse in administration phase (146 errors; 29%). Of total 688 prescriptions, 127 errors were recorded. In this regard, lack of time and/or date of order were the most common errors. Conclusions The most frequent medication errors were wrong dosage and not administering the medication to patient, and on the quality of prescribing, lack of time and/or date of order was the most frequent one. Medication errors happened more frequently in preterm neonates (P < 0.001). We think that using computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system and increasing the nurse-to-patient ratio can reduce the possibility of medication errors.

Design/methodology/approach - This study takes the core companies that invest in the P2P platform as the research background and uses data for Chinese companies and the systematic Generalised Method of Moments (the systematic GMM) to explore the relationship between the improvement of supply chain efficiency, research and development (R&D) investment, and innovation efficiency. Findings - This study indicates that core enterprise investment in P2P can cause a significant improvement in the efficiency of the supply chain and that this improvement can significantly motivate enterprises to increase R&D investment. Although the improvement of supply chain efficiency has no significant effect on improving companies' innovation efficiency, it can have a positive impact on innovation efficiency through the regulating role of R&D investment. Research limitations/implications - This research shows several limitations such as single industry and few companies involved, but it analyses the impact of P2P supply chain financing on R&D investment, and companies' innovation efficiency and broadens the research field of P2P supply chain financing. Practical implications - This article provides a theoretical direction for listed companies to invest in P2P platforms and achieve supply chain management. The research on the regulating role of this article provides a new way of thinking for the study of enterprise innovation. Originality/value - This paper analyses the impact of the core enterprise investment in P2P on R&D investment and its subsequent impact on the companies' innovation efficiency, thus broadening the research field of P2P supply chain financing.

We assessed whether processing attributes of destinations would improve destination memory in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this cross-sectional study, we tested the destination memory of 24 patients with TBI and 25 control participants in two conditions. On the first one (control condition), we invited participants to tell proverbs to celebrities' faces in order to decide, on a subsequent recognition test, whether they previously told that proverb to that celebrity or not. On the second condition (experimental introspection condition), the same procedures were repeated. However, after telling the proverbs, we invited participants to introspect about what the destination might believe about the proverbs (e.g., "What do you think that the celebrities would think about the proverbs?"). Group comparisons demonstrated better destination memory after the introspection than when no introspection was implemented in control participants, but there were no significant differences between the two conditions in patients with TBI. However, analyses of individual profiles demonstrated that more than half (n = 13) of the patients with TBI demonstrated better destination memory after introspection. While these results demonstrate a beneficial effect of introspection on destination memory for some cases of patients with TBI, more research is needed to reveal how introspection may influence patients' memory in social interactions.

Circadian Rhythm and the Immune Response: A Review	INTERNATIONAL REVIEWS OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review						neuroendocrine; circadian rhythm; immune response; immunity	SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; GENE-EXPRESSION; SLEEP; MELATONIN; CLOCK; LIGHT; TIME; PROLIFERATION; MECHANISMS; CORTISOL	For long, the immune system has been thought of as an effector mechanism reacting to antigenic challenge with defensive responses designed to eliminate 'foreign' material and return to a standby or surveillance mode. However, the recent concept now supported by substantial evidence suggests that immunity is not effector biased but is also a sensory organ and forms part of an integrated homeostatic network. The bidirectional information flow between the neuroendocrine and immune systems functions to maintain and protect the internal homeostasis of the organism. The paradox of this interwined function is that homeostasis may require the neuroendocrine system to work for or against the immune system, as is the case in infection. Potential dangers necessitate activation of the immune system, and such a response may pose risks to the integrity of the host. This occurs when an overly vigorous response may be detrimental and kill the host, as is the case of toxic shock syndrome. Therefore, the constant monitoring role of the neuroendocrine system to control and, when necessary, regulate the function of the immune system is crucial for the homeostatic integrity of the host. This reciprocity of functional need determines the mode of action to determine the context of a perceived threat and the best way to respond. Any breakdown in this two-way communication may manifest itself in problems such as autoimmunity, septic shock, or chronic infection. In this article, we review our current knowledge of circadian rhythm and its relation to the immune response.	[Habbal, O.

Ask the parents: Testing the acceptability and usability of a hypospadias decision aid	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC UROLOGY			English	Article						Decision making; Pediatrics; Hypospadias; Qualitative research	ENTERTAINMENT EDUCATION; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL	Introduction In previous work, we engaged key stakeholders to create a web-based decision aid (DA) prototype to facilitate shared decision making about hypospadias. Objective The study's objective was to use a human-centered design approach to assess the DA's acceptability and usability and revise it prior to pilot testing. Methods We recruited English-speaking parents (>= 18 years old) of sons with hypospadias (<= 5 years) for a twophase process of semi-structured phone/video interviews to obtain feedback about our DA prototype. DA webpages included: "Hypospadias," "Surgery Basics," "No Surgery," "Family Stories," "Help Me Decide," and "FAQs." In both phases, participants viewed the DA using the "think aloud" technique and completed several validated scales to evaluate its acceptability and usability. In phase 1, we collected feedback about the "Homepage" organization, values clarification methods (VCM), and webpage content. In phase 2, participants searched the DA for answers to hypospadias-related questions, provided feedback on testimonial videos and VCM, and shared their preferences about data visualizations. All interviews were audio recorded. After each phase, transcripts were qualitatively analyzed to identify key areas for revision. Revisions were made between phase 1 and 2 to improve the DA's acceptability and usability. Results We interviewed 20 participants (10/phase): median age 33.7 years, 60% female, 80% White. Mean score on the Preparation for Decision Making Scale: 86.8 (out of 100). We revised: 1) VCM, focusing on pros/ cons of surgery and question prompts, 2) "Homepage," adding webpage descriptions (Extended Summary Figure), 3) menu organization, 4) "Surgery Day" webpage, adding general anesthesia risk information, and 5) "Hypospadias" webpage, adding an icon bar graph to help participants visualize statistics. Participants thought the testimonial videos were relatable and the VCM5 would prepare them for their visit with their child's urologist. Discussion Ours is the first parent-centered DA developed and pre-tested for hypospadias. Using validated usability and acceptability scales, participants highly rated the DA in helping them arrive at a decision about surgery. Study limitations include the sample's lack of diversity (i.e., educated, health literate) and participants already decided about their son's hypospadias management before enrolling. To learn more about the DA's usability and acceptability, we plan to pilot test it in a clinical setting. Conclusions Participants found our DA informative in understanding hypospadias. There was a high perceived level of preparation for hypospadias decision making. Participatory research methods, such as "think aloud," may be helpful when testing DAs as they privilege the patient's experience.

Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of colorectal cancer (CRC). MicroRNAs are thought to be potential biomarkers of CRC. Many researchers have focused on the expression pattern of miRNAs in CRC. However, previous studies did not pay particular attention to the effects of the degree of differentiation of the cancer with respect to the miRNA expression profile. First, this study compared the expression level of 1547 miRNAs by qRT-PCR in Colorectal adenocarcinoma tissues to that in paired normal tissues. In all, 93 miRNAs were identified that were significantly dysregulated in Colorectal adenocarcinoma relative to normal tissues (P<0.05). Then, we analyzed their potential as cancer biomarkers by ROC analysis, and the result revealed that three miRNAs with high sensitivity and specificity are suitable as biomarkers for the diagnosis of CRC (the value of the AUC was greater than 0.7). Interestingly, previous reports of 23 of these miRNAs have been scarce. Furthermore, we wanted to analyze the difference between well- and moderately differentiated cancers, and as expected, 58 miRNAs showed significant dysregulation. Importantly, 32 miRNAs were able to not only distinguish cancer tissues from normal tissues, but they were also able to identify well- and moderately differentiated cancers. In conclusion, the degree of differentiation has an important influence on the miRNA expression pattern. To avoid misdiagnoses and missed diagnoses, tumors of different degrees of differentiation should be treated differently when miRNAs are used as cancer biomarkers.

Standard two-dimensional (2D) cell migration assays do not provide.. information about vertical invasion processes, which are critical for melanoma information about. progression. We provide information about three-dimensional (3D) melanoma cell. migration, proliferation and invasion in a 3D melanoma skin equivalent (MSE) model. In particular, we pay careful attention to compare the structure of the tissues in the MSE with similarly-prepared 3D human skin equivalent (HSE) models. The HSE model is identically prepared to the MSE model except that melanoma cells are omitted. Using the MSE model, we examine melanoma migration, proliferation and invasion from two different human melanoma cell lines. One cell line, WM35, is associated with the early phase of the disease where spreading is thought to be confined to the epidermis. The other cell line, SK-MEL-28, lis associated with the later phase of the disease where spreading into the dermis is expected. Methods. 3D MSE and HSE models are constructed using human de-epidermised dermis (DED) prepared from skin tissue. Primary fibroblasts and primary keratinocytes are used in the MSE and HSE models to ensure the formation of a stratified epidermis, with a well-defined basement membrane. Radial spreading of cells across the surface of the HSE downward and MSE models is observed. Vertical invasion of melanoma cells rough the skin is observed and measured using immunohistochemistry. All measurements of invasion are made at day 0, 9, 15 and 20, providing detailed time course data. Results. Both HSE and MSE models are similar to native skin in vivo, with a well-defined stratification of the epidermis that is separated from the dermis by a basement membrane. In the HSE and MSE we find fibroblast cells confined to the dermis, and differentiated keratinocytes in the epidermis. In the MSE, melanoma cells form colonies in the epidermis during the early part of the experiment. In the later stage of the experiment, the melanoma cells in the MSE invade deeper into the tissues. Interestingly, both the WM35 and SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells lead to a breakdown of the basement membrane and eventually enter the dermis. However, these two cell lines invade at different rates, with the SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells invading faster than the WM35 cells. Discussion. The MSE and HSE models are a reliable platform for studying melanoma invasion in a 3D tissue that is similar to native human skin. Interestingly, we find that the WM35 cell line that is thought to be associated with radial spreading only is able to invade into region appears Presenting our measurements the dermis. The vertical invasion of melanoma cells into the dermal to be associated with a localised disruption of the basement membrane. results in terms of time course data along with images and quantitative of the depth of invasion extends previous 3D work that has often been reported without these details.

Workforce planning has identified the need to train more general practitioners as an urgent priority. Exposure of medical students to general practice as part of the formal and hidden curriculum, the use of longitudinal integrated clerkships, and positive experiences and role models in general practice are all thought to be contributing factors to doctors choosing careers in general practice. Aim The aim of this study was to identify career destinations of medical school graduates in a medical school with an 18-week longitudinal integrated clerkship in general practice. Design and setting This study was conducted in a single graduate entry medical school at the University of Limerick, Ireland. Participants Medical school alumni 6-8 years after graduation. Method A survey of graduating cohorts of the medical school from 2011 to 2013 was conducted through email and telephone. Results There were a total of 175 alumni for the period 2011 to 2013. Data was collected on 92% (161/175) through an online survey, follow-up email and telephone interview, and was triangulated with searches of professional registration databases and information from key informants. Between 6 and 8 years after graduation, a total of 43% of alumni were engaged in general practice as a career. Conclusion The reform of the delivery of general practice within medical school curricula should be considered by medical schools, curriculum designers and policy-makers as part of an overall strategy to address the recruitment and retention of general practitioners as part of the global healthcare workforce.

Integration of seismic attributes and production data for infill drilling strategies - A virtual intelligence approach	JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						neural networks; artificial intelligence; seismic attributes; production; development		Field development strategies are at the forefront of common engineering practices in the oil and gas industry. Reservoir simulation is the most commonly applied methodology to generate an optimum field development plan. However, reservoir simulation can be an energy and cost intensive method that often relies on rather subjective assumption of input parameters, due to lack of accurate field data. In this paper, a new approach using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technology is proposed to predict individual well performances and accordingly develop infill drilling strategies. Due to its predictive capabilities, ANN is used as a tool to construct a correlation for production prediction. Seismic attributes, which capture heterogeneity of the reservoir geology. and completion information are used as network inputs. In calculating the interference effects, the geometry of the flow system under consideration was used together with the geometric location and the starting production schedule of each well within the system. The method was successfully implemented on a case study of the 19N 94W Township of the Wamsutter field in Wyoming using actual seismic attributes, completion information, well configuration, and production data. Production predictions were generated by the network for all locations at which seismic attributes were available. More promising locations were then selected for infill drilling purposes based on predicted productions at these locations. The predicted initial rite and 10-yr cumulative production were considered in the selection of infill drilling locations with high productivity potential. Results from this work show that the ANN was able to map the relationship between production, completion information, interference effects, and reservoir characteristics captured in seismic attributes. The proposed methodology allowed the construction of spatial maps of gas production, revealing new sweet spots which could not be identified from the existing production history alone. The production maps derived from the ANN predictions contain important heterogeneous features associated with reservoir properties reflected in seismic data. Even though well interference was initially thought to have a limited effect on well performance for the case study presented, the incorporation of well interference parameters in the network design improved production predictions, suggesting that well interference has a more significant impact on well performance than originally anticipated.

Given the intricate mechanisms of BESs, the application of artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have been proposed to enhance the performance of BESs due to their capability to identify patterns and gain insights through data analysis. This review focuses on the analysis and comparison of AI algorithms commonly used in BESs, including artificial neural network (ANN), genetic programming (GP), fuzzy logic (FL), support vector regression (SVR), and adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). These algorithms have different features, such as ANN's simple network structure, GP's use in the training process, FL's human-like thought process, SVR's high prediction accuracy and robustness, and ANFIS's combination of ANN and FL features. The AI-based methods have been applied in BESs to predict microbial communities, products or substrates, and reactor performance, which can provide valuable information and improve system efficiency. Limitations of AI-based methods for predicting and optimizing BESs and recommendations for future development are also discussed. This review demonstrates the potential of AI-based methods in optimizing BESs and provides valuable information for the future development of this field.

Provider Experiences with Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy Systems	ADVANCES IN SKIN & WOUND CARE			English	Article						negative-pressure wound therapy; wound care; medical device reports; wound management		OBJECTIVE: MedWatch, the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) nationwide adverse event reporting system, serves to monitor device performance after a medical device is approved or cleared for market. Through the MedWatch adverse event reporting system, the FDA receives Medical Device Reports of deaths and serious injuries with negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) systems, many of which are used in homes and in extended-care facilities. In response to reported events, this study was conducted to obtain additional information about device issues that healthcare professionals face in these settings, as well as challenges that caregivers might encounter using this technology at home. The study was exploratory and descriptive in nature. PARTICIPANTS: The FDA surveyed wound care specialists and professional home healthcare providers to learn about users' experiences with NPWT. DESIGN: In the first phase of the study, a semistructured questionnaire was developed for telephone interviews and self-administration. In the second phase, a web-based survey was adapted from the semistructured instrument. RESULTS: Respondent concerns primarily centered on issues not directly related to the NPWT devices: NPWT prescription, provider education in addition to patient training and appropriate wound management practices, notably ongoing wound assessment, and patient monitoring. CONCLUSION: Overall, respondents thought that there was a definite benefit to NPWT, regardless of the care setting, and that it was a safe therapy when prescribed and administered appropriately.

Target acquired: transcriptional regulators as drug targets for protozoan parasites	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY			English	Review						Transcription factors; Parasite; Drug target; Transcriptional modulation	EUKARYOTIC TRANSCRIPTION; GENE; INHIBITION; IDENTIFICATION; COMPLEX; TBP; DIFFERENTIATION; ENCYSTATION; RECRUITMENT; REPRESSION	Protozoan parasites are single-celled eukaryotic organisms that cause significant human disease and pose a substantial health and socioeconomic burden worldwide. They are responsible for at least 1 million deaths annually. The treatment of such diseases is hindered by the ability of parasites to form latent cysts, develop drug resistance, or be transmitted by insect vectors. Additionally, these pathogens have developed complex mechanisms to alter host gene expression. The prevalence of these diseases is predicted to increase as climate change leads to the augmentation of ambient temperatures, insect ranges, and warm water reservoirs. Therefore, the discovery of novel treatments is necessary. Transcription factors lie at the junction of multiple signalling pathways in eukaryotes and aberrant transcription factor function contributes to the progression of numerous human diseases including cancer, diabetes, inflammatory disorders and cardiovascular disease. Transcription factors were previously thought to be undruggable. However, due to recent advances, transcription factors now represent appealing drug targets. It is conceivable that transcription factors, and the pathways they regulate, may also serve as targets for anti-parasitic drug design. Here, we review transcription factors and transcriptional modulators of protozoan parasites, and discuss how they may be useful in drug discovery. We also provide information on transcription factors that play a role in stage conversion of parasites, TATA box-binding proteins, and transcription factors and cofactors that participate with RNA polymerases I, II and III. We also highlight a significant gap in knowledge in that the transcription factors of some of parasites have been underinvestigated. Understanding parasite transcriptional pathways and how parasites alter host gene expression will be essential in discovering innovative drug targets. (c) 2021 Australian Society for Parasitology.

Studies that evaluate and further develop existing practices are needed. Objectives: This study explores the use of cognitive interviews in the translation and cultural adaptation of observational measures, using the COMFORT behavioral scale as an example, and demonstrates a structured approach to the analysis of data from cognitive interviews. The COMFORT behavioral scale is developed for assessment of distress and pain in a pediatric intensive care setting. Design: Qualitative, descriptive methodological study. Setting: One general public hospital trust in southern Norway. Participants: N=12. Eight nurses, three physicians and one nurse assistant, from different wards and with experience caring for children. Methods: We translated the COMFORT behavior scale into Norwegian before conducting individual cognitive interviews. Participants first read and then used the translated version of the COMFORT behavioral scale to assess pain based on a 3-min film vignette depicting an infant in pain/distress. Two cognitive interview techniques were applied: Thinking Aloud (TA) during the assessment and Verbal Probing (VP) afterwards. In TA the participant verbalized his/her thought process while completing the COMFORT behavioral scale. During VP the participant responded to specific questions related to understanding of the measure, information recall and the decision process. We audio recorded, transcribed and analyzed interviews using a structured qualitative method (cross-case analysis based on predefined categories and development of a results matrix). Results: Our analysis revealed two categories of problems: (1) Scale problems, warranting a change in the wording of the scale, including (a) translation errors, (b) content not understood as intended, and (c) differences between the original COMFORT scale and the revised COMFORT behavioral scale; and (2) Rater-context problems caused by (a) unfamiliarity with the scale, (b) lack of knowledge and experience, and (c) assessments based on a film vignette. Conclusions: Cognitive interviews revealed problems with both the translated and the original versions of the scale and suggested solutions that enhanced the validity of both versions. Cognitive interviews might be seen as a complement to current published best practices for translation and cultural adaptation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Undergraduate Writing Promotes Student's Understanding of International Sustainable Development in Horticulture	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						sustainability; horticultural crop production; writing intensive learning; plant breeding		Promotion of undergraduate student thinking and learning in the realm of sustainable production is a new focus for horticulture curricula. In a writing intensive course, Greenhouse Management (Hort 3002W; University of Minnesota), students focus their learning of sustainability by writing peer-reviewed, 3-phase 'Worldwide Sustainable Horticultural Crop Production Papers' on past, present, and future prospects for sustainability. The USA is used as an in-class example throughout the semester while each student focuses their writing on a specific country of their choosing. Their papers focus on eight goals for each country across the three Phases: I-their choice of a country, definition of sustainability, identification of historical production practices, current production statistics; II-current production practices and integration of historical/current practices (ranked strategies); III-finalized sustainable development strategy, design of a future sustainable, controlled-environment production facility. The last two goals (Phase III) provide plant breeders with potential breeding objectives for country-specific cultivar development within a sustainable production framework. Completed papers are web-published for global availability to enable each country's researchers and policy makers to access sustainable ideas for future development. In 2009-2010, 'Worldwide Sustainable Horticultural Crop Production Papers' were published for 41 countries which were downloaded 3900 times in 19 months through April 2011. This large readership indicates such an assignment can generate interest in either undergraduate writing about developing sustainable horticulture and/or the topic area itself, although the exact purpose of the downloads or the location of the users could not be determined.

Deep learning image segmentation reveals patterns of UV reflectance evolution in passerine birds	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							AVIAN PLUMAGE COLOR; ULTRAVIOLET VISION; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; SIGNALS; RADIATION; SELECTION; PIGMENTATION; DESIGN; MODELS; SYSTEM	Ultraviolet colouration is thought to be an important form of signalling in many bird species, yet broad insights regarding the prevalence of ultraviolet plumage colouration and the factors promoting its evolution are currently lacking. In this paper, we develop a image segmentation pipeline based on deep learning that considerably outperforms classical (i.e. non deep learning) segmentation methods, and use this to extract accurate information on whole-body plumage colouration from photographs of >24,000 museum specimens covering >4500 species of passerine birds. Our results demonstrate that ultraviolet reflectance, particularly as a component of other colours, is widespread across the passerine radiation but is strongly phylogenetically conserved. We also find clear evidence in support of the role of light environment in promoting the evolution of ultraviolet plumage colouration, and a weak trend towards higher ultraviolet plumage reflectance among bird species with ultraviolet rather than violet-sensitive visual systems. Overall, our study provides important broad-scale insight into an enigmatic component of avian colouration, as well as demonstrating that deep learning has considerable promise for allowing new data to be brought to bear on long-standing questions in ecology and evolution. Here, the authors develop software that uses photographs of birds to extract information on plumage UV reflectance. They use these data to show that UV reflectance is phylogenetically conserved and associated with the light environment.	[He, Yichen; Varley, Zoe K.; Nouri, Lara O.; Moody, Christopher J.

J	Saarela, AM				Saarela, Anna-Maria			Change of behaviour when selecting food products in a supermarket environment after reminding consumers about weight management	PUBLIC HEALTH NUTRITION			English	Article						Package labelling; Nutrition quality; Food selection; Time taken; Weight management	NUTRITION INFORMATION; ATTENTION; CHOICES; TIME	Objective The aim was to explore how the behaviour of consumers changed while they selected food in a supermarket environment after they were reminded about weight management. This investigation was carried out from the perspective of selection criteria, reading of package labels, nutritional quality of the products selected and time taken to select a product. Design The subjects, who were actively watching their weight, participated in two consecutive tasks in a supermarket. They were given a shopping list of eleven food categories and asked to think aloud while selecting from each category a product they usually buy and a product they would use for weight management. The data (n 792 selections) were collected through interviews and a verbal analysis protocol combined with wireless audio-visual observation. Subjects Thirty-six consumers were recruited from a sample of 367 supermarket customers. Setting Kuopio, Finland. Results The subjects' behaviour changed radically after they were reminded about weight management. In the first selection, taste and familiarity were the main food selection criteria while in the latter selection the energy/fat content predominated. Consequently, the nutritional quality of products improved greatly because subjects read package labels twice as much in the latter selection. The time taken to select a product increased significantly, on average, from 23 (sd 10) to 60 (sd 51) s/product (P = 0 center dot 000). Conclusions Only by reminding consumers about weight management was there a significant impact on their food selection behaviour. Marketing communication should be developed which quickly and easily promotes consumers' awareness of healthy food in supermarkets.

The drivers of reflection in arts-based coaching	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						critical reflection; art; coaching; self-awareness; transformation; organisational development; creativity	MANAGEMENT; LEADERSHIP; LIFE	Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore the use of art in coaching and to determine how art contributes to the ability of clients/coaches to reflect critically.Design and methodology: This qualitative study used in-depth interviews with coaches who make regular use of a visual art form as a coaching tool. The sample focused on the diversity of coaches and the coaching context. A phenomenological approach was used as the focus was to gather the experiences of the participating coaches on their practices of art in coaching.Findings/results: The views of participant coaches on outcomes have been gathered, which includes better insight (aha-moments), a stronger focus on goals, willingness to use their creativity and changes in perception. Five key drivers of critical reflection have been identified, and it was found that the experience of creating art, as opposed to viewing art, produces these results more often.Practical implications: The findings of this research provide coaches with an additional mechanism to foster critical reflection with their clients, the educators of coaches with food for thought when developing coaching curricular.Originality/value: This study contributes empirical evidence to the body of knowledge on reflective practices, transformation and coaching as well as key drivers that enhance critical reflection in clients.Limitations of the study: Information was gathered from coaches only. For ethical reasons, the coaches could not reveal the identity of their clients. So feedback through the lens of the clients was not gathered.

To evaluate changes in dementia caregivers' depression, anxiety, and stress following CBT. Also to assess quality of life, intervention adherence/satisfaction and therapy effectiveness using different formats, frequencies, and delivery methods. Research Design and Methods: Studies were identified through electronic bibliographic searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library) and from gray literature (Conference Proceedings Citation Index and clinicaltrials. gov). Data were pooled for meta-analysis. Results: Twenty-five studies were included. Depression (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.47 to -0.21; p < .001) and stress (SMD = -0.36; 95% CI: -0.52 to -0.20; p < .001) were significantly reduced after CBT, relative to comparator groups, while anxiety was not (SMD = 0.10; 95% CI: -0.18 to 0.39; p = .47). A subgroup analysis demonstrated that statistically significant reductions in depression and stress were limited to group, but not individual, formats. An additional subgroup analysis revealed that eight CBT sessions or fewer were equally effective as more than eight sessions at significantly reducing depression and stress, relative to comparator groups. Furthermore, analysis with independent samples t-tests demonstrated no statistically significant differences between mean changes in depression (MD = 0.79; 95% CI: -0.45 to 2.03; p = .21) and stress (MD = 0.21; 95% CI: -1.43 to 1.85; p = .80) when directly comparing CBT groups of <= 8 and > 8 sessions. Discussion and Implications: Group CBT provides small but significant benefits to caregivers' depression and stress. Therapy cost-effectiveness may be improved by limiting therapy to group formats and eight sessions.

Whilst their common goal is to reduce the impact of parental mental illness on children, the mechanisms by which they improve outcomes in different systems and settings are less well known. This kind of knowledge can importantly contribute to ensuring that practice programs achieve pre-defined impacts.</p> Methods: The aim of this study was to develop knowledge about relationships between contextual factors, mechanisms and impact that could inform a program theory for developing, implementing, and evaluating family-focused practice. Principles of a realist evaluation approach and complex system thinking were used to conceptualize the design of semi-structured in-depth interviews with individuals who led the implementation of programs. Seventeen individuals from eight countries participated in the study.</p> Results: Interviewees provided rich accounts of the components that programs should include, contextual factors in which they operated, as well as the behavior changes in practitioners that programs needed to achieve. Together with information from the literature, we developed an initial program theory, which illustrates the interconnectedness between changes that need to co-occur in practitioners, parents, and children, many of which related to a more open communication about parental mental health problems. Stigma, risk-focused and fragmented health systems, and a lack of management commitment were the root causes explaining, for example, why conversations about parents' mental illness did not take place, or not in a way that they could help children. Enabling practitioners to focus on parents' strengths was assumed to trigger changes in knowledge, emotions and behaviors in parents that would subsequently benefit children, by reducing feelings of guilt and improving self-esteem.</p> Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first research, which synthesizes knowledge about how family-focused practice programs works in a way that it can inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of programs. Stakeholder, who fund, design, implement or evaluate programs should start co-developing and using program theories like the one presented in this paper to strengthen the design and delivery of family-focused practice.</p>	[Bauer, Annette; Malley, Juliette] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Care Policy & Evaluat Ctr, Dept Hlth Policy, London, England; [Best, Stephanie] Macquarie Univ, Australian Inst Hlth Innovat, N Ryde, NSW, Australia; [Christiansen, Hanna] Philipps Univ, Dept Psychol Clin Child & Adolescent Psychol, Marburg, Germany; [Goodyear, Melinda] Monash Univ, Sch Rural Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Zechmeister-Koss, Ingrid] Austrian Inst Hlth Technol Assessment GmbH, Vienna, Austria; [Paul, Jean] Med Univ Innsbruck, Div Psychiat 1, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Innsbruck, Austria	University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Macquarie University; Philipps University Marburg; Monash University; Medical University of Innsbruck	Bauer, A (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Care Policy & Evaluat Ctr, Dept Hlth Policy, London, England.	a.bauer@lse.ac.uk	Malley, Juliette N/B-5537-2014; Paul, Jean/GYR-3612-2022; Goodyear, Melinda/H-3281-2014; Paul, Jean/AAY-8627-2021	Malley, Juliette N/0000-0001-5759-1647; Goodyear, Melinda/0000-0002-5928-0161; Paul, Jean/0000-0003-0891-7035; Best, Stephanie/0000-0002-1107-8976					51	6	6	0	9	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND	1664-0640			FRONT PSYCHIATRY	Front.

J	Kurumluoglugil, R; Tanriverdi, D				Kurumluoglugil, Rabia; Tanriverdi, Derya			The effects of the psychoeducation on cognitive distortions, negative automatic thoughts and dysfunctional attitudes of patients diagnosed with depression	PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH & MEDICINE			English	Article						Depression; psychoeducation; cognitive distortions; negative automatic thoughts; psychiatric nursing	PROGRAM	There are many studies showing a positive relationship between depression level and cognitive distortions in the literature. The study was carried out to determine the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy-based psychoeducation on cognitive distortions, negative automatic thoughts and dysfunctional attitudes of patients diagnosed with depression. This study was designed as a two-group pre-posttest study. The study sample composed of a total of 60 patients (30 patients in the treatment group and 30 patients in the control group) who met the eligibility criteria. The data have been collected by using The Personal Information Form, Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire, The Dysfunctional Attitude Scale and Interpersonal Cognitive Distortions Scale. Psychoeducation was provided in the form of individual training once a week in total of eight sessions. For the pretest, assumption and schemas that make people predispose to depression, dysfunctional attitudes and cognitive distortions in interpersonal relationships were seen frequently to be above average in all patients. It was determined that patients in the treatment group used significantly less dysfunctional attitudes and to had lower negative automatic thoughts and interpersonal cognitive distortions compared with patients in the control group in posttest (p < 0.05). Consequently, cognitive behavioral therapy-based psychoeducation has become considerably effective in decreasing the use of negative automatic thoughts, interpersonal cognitive distortions and dysfunctional attitudes in patients with depression. cognitive behavioral therapy-based psychoeducation should be thought of as a treatment component due to its effectiveness in nursing care of depressed patients.

However, the origin of this ordinal position effect has remained unclear. It was suggested that the direction of serial order-space interaction is related to the reading/writing experience. An alternative hypothesis is that it originates from the more is right/more is up spatial metaphors we use in daily life. We can adjudicate between the two viewpoints in Chinese readers; they read left-to-right but also have a culturally ancient top-to-bottom reading/writing direction. Thus, the reading/writing viewpoint predicts no or a top-to-bottom effect in serial order-space interaction; whereas the spatial metaphor theory predicts a clear bottom-to-top effect. We designed four experiments to investigate this issue. First, we found a left-to-right ordinal position effect, replicating results obtained in Western populations. However, the vertical ordinal position effect was in the bottom-to-top direction; moreover, it was modulated by hand position (e.g., left hand bottom or up). We suggest that order-space interactions may originate from different sources and are driven by metaphoric comprehension, which itself may ground cognitive processing.

METHODS: The Life Course Intervention Research Network, a collaborative national network of >75 researchers, service providers, community representatives and thought leaders, participated in an iterative review process. Building on the revised Medical Research Council Guidance for Developing and Evaluating Complex Interventions, they identified 12 additional key models with features for inclusion in the LCIRF, then incorporated the 12 characteristics identified by the Life Course Intervention Research Network as actionable features of Life Course Interventions to produce the new LCIRF. RESULTS: The LCIRF sets out a detailed step-wise approach to intervention development: (1) conceptualization and planning, (2) design, (3) implementation, (4) evaluation, and (5) spreading and scaling of interventions. Each step is infused with life course intervention characteristics including a focus on (1) collaborative codesign (2) health optimization, (3) supporting emerging health development capabilities (4) strategic timing, (5) multilevel approaches, and (6) health equity. Key features include a detailed transdisciplinary knowledge synthesis to inform intervention development; formation of strong partnerships with family, community, and youth representatives in intervention codesign; a means of testing the impact of each intervention on biobehavioral processes underlying emerging health trajectories; and close attention to intervention context. CONCLUSIONS: This first iteration of the LCIRF has been largely expert driven. Next steps will involve widespread partner engagement in framework refinement and further development. Implementation will require changes to the way intervention studies are organized and funded.

Describing posterior distributions of variance components: Problems and the use of null distributions to aid interpretation	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article; Early Access						hierarchical models; null distribution; permutation; simulations; squidSim; variance	LINEAR MIXED MODELS; CROSS-VALIDATION; INDIVIDUAL VARIATION; PERMUTATION TESTS; PRACTICAL GUIDE; REPEATABILITY; HERITABILITY; EQUIVALENCE; POPULATIONS; PARAMETERS	1. Assessing the biological relevance of variance components estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based mixed-effects models is not straight-forward. Variance estimates are constrained to be greater than zero and their posterior distributions are often asymmetric. Different measures of central tendency for these distributions can therefore vary widely, and credible intervals cannot overlap zero, making it difficult to assess the size and statistical support for among-group variance. Statistical support is often assessed through visual inspection of the whole posterior distribution and so relies on subjective decisions for interpretation. 2. We use simulations to demonstrate the difficulties of summarizing the posterior distributions of variance estimates from MCMC-based models. We then describe different methods for generating the expected null distribution (i.e. a distribution of effect sizes that would be obtained if there was no among-group variance) that can be used to aid in the interpretation of variance estimates. 3. Through comparing commonly used summary statistics of posterior distributions of variance components, we show that the posterior median is predominantly the least biased. We further show how null distributions can be used to derive a p-value that provides complementary information to the commonly presented measures of central tendency and uncertainty. Finally, we show how these p-values facilitate the implementation of power analyses within an MCMC framework. 4. The use of null distributions for variance components can aid study design and the interpretation of results from MCMC-based models. We hope that this manuscript will make empiricists using mixed models think more carefully about their results, what descriptive statistics they present and what inference they can make.

Displays were found to be highly complex, with variation among species the product of constraints on signal design and adaptations to local social environments. Our findings show why the same system of communication-here, used to advertise territorial ownership-can vary in complexity among closely related species, and helps reveal the origins of complexity more generally. Animal signals are observed to vary widely in complexity among species, but why this should be the case-especially among closely related taxa-is unclear. Identifying the selective forces that drive these differences is important for understanding signal evolution, as well as the origins of communication more generally. We used a measure derived from information theory to quantify the complexity of visual territorial advertisement displays performed by males of closely related taxa of Puerto Rican Anolis lizard. In general, the information potential of visual displays appeared to be high compared with signals of other taxonomic groups (e.g., other lizards, birds). Nevertheless, there was still considerable variation in signal complexity among the Anolis taxa studied. We found a strong relationship between signal complexity and phylogeny for some aspects of the advertisement display traditionally thought to be important in species recognition. Other aspects of the display tended to vary independently of phylogeny, with differences in signal complexity among taxa reflecting the distance over which displays were typically viewed by territorial neighbors, and to some extent the number of sympatric congeners present in the environment. More generally, we highlight a little used, but tractable means of quantifying complexity in different species-and in different aspects of the same signal (the number, timing, and type of components)-that can reveal the evolutionary processes generating increases (or decreases) in communicative complexity.

Self-reported pain or injury from equipment used on military deployment	OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE-OXFORD			English	Article						Australia; cross-sectional studies; military; musculoskeletal; occupational	NECK PAIN; BACK; ARMY	Background Information about pain and injury from equipment on a particular deployment is not disaggregated in the literature; thus, the nature of the issue is unclear. Aims To determine the prevalence of pain or injury during a particular deployment that military personnel attributed to equipment they used on this deployment; and to document the types of equipment they identified, the type of pain or injury and how they thought the pain or injury occurred. Methods This paper analyses data from a deployment and health survey of Australian Defence Force personnel. The participants are 8932 personnel who deployed to Iraq and 6534 who deployed to Afghanistan. Participants indicated whether they experienced pain or injury from equipment they used on deployment and detailed their experiences in response to an open-ended question (n = 563). Results Sixteen per cent of Iraq-deployed and 21% of Afghanistan-deployed participants reported pain or injury from equipment they used on deployment. Body armour was the most common equipment identified; however, a wide range of equipment was related to pain or injury. A new finding is that pain or injury related to armour was attributed to its wear in vehicles and during vehicle ingress or egress. Conclusions Knowledge of the nature of pain or injury related to equipment used on deployment may help inform improved designs and practices to reduce or prevent avoidable harm to serving personnel.

However, information obtained from previous studies was not satisfactory, implying that new direction of studies is in need. Thus, we have tried profiling intracellular free amino acids in normal and cancerous cells to extract some information about such relationship by way of the change in IFAA levels in response to the treatment of three kinase inhibitors. We define two measures such as relative susceptibility (RS) and relative efficacy (RE) to numerically quantify susceptibility of cell line to treatment and efficacy of treatment on cell line, respectively.MethodsWe applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the intracellular free amino acids (IFAAs) of isogenic breast cells with oncogenic mutation in K-Ras or PI3K genes to investigate the change in IFAA levels in response to the treatment of three kinase inhibitors. Two-dimensional plot, which was graphically represented by using the first two principal components (PCs), enabled us to evaluate the treatment efficacy in cancerous cells in terms of the quantitative distance of two IFAA profiles from cancerous and normal cells with the same treatment condition.ResultsThe biggest change in metabolic states in K-Ras mutant cell was caused by REGO for both treatment time (RS=2.31 (24 h) and 1.64 (48 h)). Regarding RE, REGO was the most effective on K-Ras/PI3K mutant cell line for treatment time 24h (RE=1.28) while PI3K inhibitor had good effect on K-Ras mutant cell line for 48h (RE=1.1).ConclusionsNumerical study on the link between amino acid profile and cancer has been done in two different dimensions. We then summarized such link in terms of two new metrics such as RS and RE, which we first define in this work. Although our study based on those metrics seems to work, we think that the usefulness of the metrics in cancer study of this kind need to be further investigated.

J	Valentova, JV; Havlícek, J				Valentova, Jaroslava Varella; Havlicek, Jan			Perceived Sexual Orientation Based on Vocal and Facial Stimuli Is Linked to Self-Rated Sexual Orientation in Czech Men	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GAY; ACCURACY; MASCULINITY; CATEGORIZATION; FEMININITY; PERCEPTION; JUDGMENTS; GENDER	Previous research has shown that lay people can accurately assess male sexual orientation based on limited information, such as face, voice, or behavioral display. Gender-atypical traits are thought to serve as cues to sexual orientation. We investigated the presumed mechanisms of sexual orientation attribution using a standardized set of facial and vocal stimuli of Czech men. Both types of stimuli were rated for sexual orientation and masculinity-femininity by non-student heterosexual women and homosexual men. Our data showed that by evaluating vocal stimuli both women and homosexual men can judge sexual orientation of the target men in agreement with their self-reported sexual orientation. Nevertheless, only homosexual men accurately attributed sexual orientation of the two groups from facial images. Interestingly, facial images of homosexual targets were rated as more masculine than heterosexual targets. This indicates that attributions of sexual orientation are affected by stereotyped association between femininity and male homosexuality; however, reliance on such cues can lead to frequent misjudgments as was the case with the female raters. Although our study is based on a community sample recruited in a non-English speaking country, the results are generally consistent with the previous research and thus corroborate the validity of sexual orientation attributions.

A chemical kinetic basis for measuring translation initiation and elongation rates from ribosome profiling data	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							MESSENGER-RNA TRANSLATION; GENOME-WIDE ANALYSIS; GENE-EXPRESSION; IN-VIVO; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; REVEALS PRINCIPLES; YEAST; DYNAMICS; FOOTPRINT	Analysis methods based on simulations and optimization have been previously developed to estimate relative translation rates from next-generation sequencing data. Translation involves molecules and chemical reactions, hence bioinformatics methods consistent with the laws of chemistry and physics are more likely to produce accurate results. Here, we derive simple equations based on chemical kinetic principles to measure the translation-initiation rate, transcriptome-wide elongation rate, and individual codon translation rates from ribosome profiling experiments. Our methods reproduce the known rates from ribosome profiles generated from detailed simulations of translation. By applying our methods to data from S. cerevisiae and mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that the extracted rates reproduce expected correlations with various molecular properties, and we also find that mouse embryonic stem cells have a global translation speed of 5.2 AA/s, in agreement with previous reports that used other approaches. Our analysis further reveals that a codon can exhibit up to 26-fold variability in its translation rate depending upon its context within a transcript. This broad distribution means that the average translation rate of a codon is not representative of the rate at which most instances of that codon are translated, and it suggests that translational regulation might be used by cells to a greater degree than previously thought. Author summary The process of translating the genetic information encoded in an mRNA molecule to a protein is crucial to cellular life and plays a role in regulating gene expression. The translation initiation rate of a transcript is a direct measure of the rate of protein synthesis and is the key kinetic parameter defining translational control of the gene's expression. Translation rates of individual codons play a considerable role in coordinating co-translational processes like protein folding and protein secretion and thus contribute to the proper functioning of the encoded protein. Direct measurement of these rates in vivo is nontrivial and recent next generation sequencing methods like ribosome profiling offer an opportunity to quantify these rates for the entire translatome. In this study, we develop chemical kinetic models to measure absolute rates and quantify the influence of different molecular factors in shaping the variability of these rates at codon resolution. These new analysis methods are significant because they allow scientists to measure absolute rates of translation from Next-Generation Sequencing data, provide analysis tools rooted in the physical sciences rather than heuristic or ad hoc approaches, and allow for the quantitative, rather than qualitative study of translation kinetics.

J	Kadooka, Y; Asai, A; Bito, S				Kadooka, Yasuhiro; Asai, Atsushi; Bito, Seiji			Can physicians' judgments of futility be accepted by patients?: A comparative survey of Japanese physicians and laypeople	BMC MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article							MEDICAL FUTILITY; CARE; PERCEPTIONS	Back ground: Empirical surveys about medical futility are scarce relative to its theoretical assumptions. We aimed to evaluate the difference of attitudes between laypeople and physicians towards the issue. Methods: A questionnaire survey was designed. Japanese laypeople (via Internet) and physicians with various specialties (via paper-and-pencil questionnaire) were asked about whether they would provide potentially futile treatments for end-of-life patients in vignettes, important factors for judging a certain treatment futile, and threshold of quantitative futility which reflects the numerical probability that an act will produce the desired physiological effect. Also, the physicians were asked about their practical frequency and important reasons for futile treatments. Results: 1134 laypeople and 401 (80%) physicians responded. In all vignettes, the laypeople were more affirmative in providing treatments in question significantly. As the factors for judging futility, medical information and quality of life (QOL) of the patient were rather stressed by the physicians. Treatment wish of the family of the patient and psychological impact on patient side due to the treatment were rather stressed by laypeople. There were wide variations in the threshold of judging quantitative futility in both groups. 88.3% of the physicians had practical experience of providing futile treatment. Important reasons for it were communication problem with patient side and lack of systems regarding futility or foregoing such treatment. Conclusion: Laypeople are more supportive of providing potentially futile treatments than physicians. The difference is explained by the importance of medical information, the patient family's influence to decision-making and QOL of the patient. The threshold of qualitative futility is suggested to be arbitrary.

J	Douglas, I; Napolitano, RK; Garlock, M; Glisic, B				Douglas, Isabella; Napolitano, Rebecca K.; Garlock, Maria; Glisic, Branko			Cuba's National School of Ballet: Redefining a structural icon	ENGINEERING STRUCTURES			English	Article						National Ballet School; Cuba; Thin-tile vaulting; Finite element modeling		The National School of Ballet is one of five art schools designed in Havana, Cuba during the reign of Fidel Castro. While construction of the schools started in the early 1960s, it was halted before the building was completed resulting in the eventual abandonment of the school. Currently, the school is in a state of disrepair and preservation plans are being drafted to restore it. Historically, it was thought that many of the large spans in the ballet complex were constructed using an approach called thin-file vaulting. However, during fieldwork in Havana, the authors found that despite surface-level appearances, the complex is not entirely constructed with thin-file vaulting. In many cases, a surface-level of thin-file vaulting covers reinforced concrete structural systems. The objective of this work is to understand and document the structural systems of the National Ballet School, specifically the main dome. The buildings were documented using terrestrial photography and spherical imaging; structural analysis of the main dome was carried out using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. By combining these methods, it was found that the design of the National Ballet School economically, elegantly, and efficiently blends reinforced concrete with thin-file vaulting to showcase the mastery of the engineers and builders.

AVFs typically require 6 to 8 weeks to "mature" from the time of surgery before they can be cannulated. Patients with end-stage renal disease needing urgent vascular access therefore traditionally require insertion of a tunnelled central venous catheter (TCVC). TCVCs are associated with high infection rates and central venous stenosis. Early cannulation synthetic arteriovenous grafts (ecAVG) provide a novel alternative to TCVCs, permitting rapid access to the bloodstream and immediate needling for haemodialysis. Published rates of infection in small series are low. The aim of this study is to compare whether TCVC +/- AVF or ecAVG +/- AVF provide a better strategy for managing patients requiring immediate vascular access for haemodialysis. Methods/design: This is a prospective randomised controlled trial comparing the strategy of TCVC +/- AVF to ecAVG +/- AVF. Patients requiring urgent vascular access will receive a study information sheet and written consent will be obtained. Patients will be randomised to receive either: (i) TCVC (and native AVF if this is anatomically possible) or (ii) ecAVG (+/- AVF). 118 patients will be recruited. The primary outcome is systemic bacteraemia at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include culture-proven bacteraemia rates at 1 year and 2 years; primary and secondary patency rates at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months; stenoses; re-intervention rates; re-admission rate; mortality and quality of life. Additionally, treatment delays, impact on service provision and cost-effectiveness will be evaluated. Discussion: This is the first randomised controlled trial comparing TCVC to ecAVG for patients requiring urgent vascular access for haemodialysis. The complications of TCVC are considered an unfortunate necessity in patients requiring urgent haemodialysis who do not have autologous vascular access. If this study demonstrates that ecAVGs provide a safe and practical alternative to TCVC, this could instigate a paradigm shift in nephrology thinking and access planning.

Insights into Australian optometrists' knowledge and attitude towards prescribing blue light-blocking ophthalmic devices	OPHTHALMIC AND PHYSIOLOGICAL OPTICS			English	Article						blue light; blue-blocking; computer vision syndrome; CVS; optometry; retina; spectacles; survey	LENSES; SLEEP	Purpose The aim of this cross-sectional study was to survey Australian optometrists regarding their attitudes towards, and knowledge of, blue light-blocking lenses designed to attenuate blue light transmission to the eye. Methods A 29-item survey was distributed at a major national optometry education conference and through professional networks. Respondents provided information regarding their demographics and practice modalities, knowledge about the potential effects of blue light, and attitudes towards prescribing blue light-blocking ophthalmic devices. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the factors that predicted optometrists' prescribing of blue light-blocking lenses. Results Of 372 respondents, 75.3% indicated prescribing blue light-blocking spectacle lenses in their clinical practice. Forty-four per cent of optometrists considered daily environmental exposure to blue light as a potential cause of retinal damage, and approximately half of respondents thought blue light emitted from computer screens was an important factor in causing computer vision syndrome. About half of optometrists considered placebo effects to potentially play a role, at least sometimes, in patients' experiences with blue light-blocking lenses. Most optometrists estimated that they first prescribed a blue light-blocking lens in 2016. The most common reason optometrists prescribed these devices was for patients who were computer or electronic device users (87.9%). The two main sources of information used to guide practitioners' management approaches were conference presentations and manufacturer product information. Practitioners were significantly more likely to prescribe blue light-blocking lenses if they considered blue light to cause either retinal damage (odds ratio, OR 2.28, 95%CI 1.34-3.88, p = 0.002) or computer vision syndrome (OR 2.52, 95%CI 1.41-4.50, p = 0.002) compared with practitioners who did not consider such factors to be relevant. Conclusion Prescribing trends by Australian optometrists in relation to blue light-blocking lenses reflect the inconclusive nature of several aspects of the evidence in this field. Blue light-blocking lens prescribing has increased since 2010, despite practitioners acknowledging the lack of high-quality evidence to support their use and also commonly believing that placebo effects may have a role in patient responses to these lenses. Information from this study will help inform the development of resources to guide evidence-based prescribing of blue light-blocking lens products.

J	von Hippel, E; von Krogh, G				von Hippel, Eric; von Krogh, Georg			Identifying Viable "Need-Solution Pairs": Problem Solving Without Problem Formulation	ORGANIZATION SCIENCE			English	Article						organizational economics; economics and organization; managerial and organizational cognition; organization and management theory; decision making and theory of the firm; knowledge production; innovation; information transfer costs	5 PERSONALITY DIMENSIONS; SERENDIPITY; INFORMATION; KNOWLEDGE; PERFORMANCE; EXPERIENCE; THINKING; DESIGN; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY	Problem-solving research and formal problem-solving practice begin with the assumption that a problem has been identified or formulated for solving. The problem-solving process then involves a search for a satisfactory or optimal solution to that problem. In contrast, we propose that, in informal problem solving, a need and a solution are often discovered together and tested for viability as a "need-solution pair.'' For example, one may serendipitously discover a new solution and assess it to be worth adopting although the "problem" it would address had not previously been in mind as an object of search or even awareness. In such a case, problem identification and formulation, if done at all, come only after the discovery of the need-solution pair. We propose the identification of need-solution pairs as an approach to problem solving in which problem formulation is not required. We argue that discovery of viable need-solution pairs without problem formulation may have advantages over problem-initiated problem-solving methods under some conditions. First, it removes the often considerable costs associated with problem formulation. Second, it eliminates the constraints on possible solutions that any problem formulation will inevitably apply.

BackgroundIn Norway and other European countries, there is an increased focus on ageing at home, which is aided by technology, as well as formal and informal care. The literature reveals that caregivers endure physical and mental burdens. With computer-mediated communication, such as telecare, it is possible for nurses to provide supportive care to caregivers in their homes. DesignAn explorative design using qualitative content analysis. MethodSix nurses and nine caregivers with residential spouses suffering from stroke or dementia were interviewed two times over a six-month period. ResultsThe nurses responded dynamically to the information they received and helped to empower the individual caregivers and to strengthen the interpersonal relationships between the caregivers. While some participants thought that meeting in a virtual room was close and intimate, others wanted to maintain a certain distance. The participants' altered their roles as the masters and receivers of knowledge and experience; this variation was based on a relationship in which mutual respect for one another and an interest in learning from one another allowed them to work together as partners to demonstrate the system and to follow-up with new caregivers. ConclusionsThe flexibility of the service allows the possibility of engaging in a close, or to some extent, a more distant relationship, depending on the participants' attitudes towards using this type of service. Relevance to clinical practiceNurses can provide close care, support and information to caregivers who endeavour to master their everyday lives together with their sick spouses. The support seems to help the caregivers cope with their own physical and emotional problems.

This study aimed to understand the lived experience of acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI), including symptoms and severity, perceived causes, and healthcare seeking behaviors of AGI in the small Inuit community of Rigolet, Canada. A concurrent mixed quantitative and qualitative methods design was used. Two cross-sectional retrospective surveys provided quantitative data to examine self-reported AGI symptoms and the distribution of potential risk factors in the community. Qualitative data from in-depth interviews with one-third of AGI cases were analyzed using a constant-comparative method to describe symptoms and severity, identify perceived risk factors, and explore health seeking behavior of AGI in Rigolet. Of the survey respondents reporting AGI, most reported symptoms of diarrhea without vomiting, followed by diarrhea with vomiting, and vomiting without diarrhea. The most common secondary symptoms included stomach cramps and abdominal pain, nausea, and extreme tiredness. Community members identified potential risk factors for AGI that reflect the epidemiology triad (host, agent, and environmental factors), including hygiene, retail food, tap water, boil water advisories, and personal stress. Risk aversion and healthcare seeking behaviors reflected the core constructs of the Health Belief Model (perceived susceptibility, severity, and benefits and barriers to action). Understanding community experience, perspectives, and beliefs related to AGI is useful for public health practitioners and health care providers. This information is important especially considering the relatively high estimated burden of AGI and the relatively low healthcare seeking behaviors in some Indigenous communities compared to national estimates. Moreover, the mixed-methods approach used to understand the burden of AGI could be extended to other health research in Indigenous contexts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The patient-centred Myeloma Patient Outcome Scale (MyPOS) was developed to assess and monitor symptoms and supportive care factors in routine care. Our aim was to translate and culturally adapt the outcome measure to the German context, and to explore its face and content validity. Methods Translation and cultural adaptation following established guidelines used an exploratory, sequential mixed method study design. Steps included: (1) forward translation to German; (2) backward translation to English; (3) expert review; (4) focus groups with the target population (patients, family members, healthcare professionals) to achieve conceptual equivalence; (5) cognitive interviews using Tourangeau's model with think-aloud technique to evaluate comprehension and acceptability; (6) final review. Results were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Cultural and linguistic differences were noted between the German and English original version. The focus groups (n = 11) and cognitive interviews (n = 9) both highlighted the need for adapting individual items and their answer options to the German healthcare context. Greater individuality regarding need for information with the right to not be informed was elaborated by patients. While the comprehensive nature of the tool was appreciated, item wording regarding satisfaction with healthcare was deemed not appropriate in the German context. Before implementation into routine care, patients' concerns about keeping their MyPOS data confidential need to be addressed as a barrier, whereas the MyPOS itself was perceived as a facilitator/prompt for a patient-centred discussion of QoL issues. Conclusion With adaptations to answer options and certain items, the German version of the MyPOS can help monitor symptoms and problems afflicting myeloma patients over the course of the disease trajectory. It can help promote a model of comprehensive supportive and patient-centred care for these patients.

The campaign ran between October 2021 and June 2022, with 3-months follow-up. The RE-AIM framework was used for process evaluation. Measurements included surveys and interviews, a log of activities (e.g. webinars, social media posts) and engagements (e.g. attendees, reactions to posts), and Google Analytics.ResultsThere were 29,053 interactions with campaign activities. More than three-quarters of professionals (n = 63/81) thought webinars were very or extremely helpful. Professionals and people with dementia and carers reported that the website provided appropriate content, an approachable tone, and was easy to use. Following campaign engagement, professionals planned to (n = 77/80) or had modified (n = 29/44) how they communicated the diagnosis and/or provided post-diagnostic information and referrals. Qualitative data suggested that the campaign may have led to benefits for some people with dementia and carers.ConclusionsForward with Dementia was successful in terms of reach, appropriateness, adoption and maintenance for professionals, however flow-through impacts on people with dementia are not clear. Targeted campaigns can potentially change health professionals' communication and support around chronic diseases such as dementia.

However, the rate of poor mental health outcomes, and in particular suicide, is significantly raised in rural populations. This is thought to be due to lack of early diagnosis, health service access, the distance-decay effect, poor physical health determinants and access to firearms. Research conducted by the National Centre for Farmer Health between 2004 and 2009 reveals that there is a correlation between obesity and psychological distress among the farming community where suicide rates are recognised as high. Chronic stress overstimulates the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that is associated with abdominal obesity. Increasing physical activity may block negative thoughts, increase social contact, positively influence brain chemistry and improve both physical and mental health. This paper describes the design of the Farming Fit study that aims to identify the effect of physical activity on psychological distress, obesity and health behaviours such as diet patterns and smoking in farm men and women. Methods/Design: For this quasi experimental (convenience sample) control intervention study, overweight (Body Mass Index >= 25 kg/m(2)) farm men and women will be recruited from Sustainable Farm Families (TM) (SFF) programs held across Victoria, Australia. Baseline demographic data, health data, depression anxiety stress scale (DASS) scores, dietary information, physical activity data, anthropometric data, blood pressure and biochemical analysis of plasma an salivary cortisol levels will be collected. The intervention group will receive an exercise program and regular phone coaching in order to increase their physical activity. Analysis will evaluate the impact of the intervention by longitudinal data (baseline and post intervention) comparison of intervention and control groups. Discussion: This study is designed to examine the effect of physical activity on psychological health and other co-morbidities such as obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension and dyslipidaemia within a high-risk cohort. The outcomes of this research will be relevant to further research and service delivery programs, in particular those tailored to rural communities.

Although light stimuli accompanied by contrast and strength changes are thought to have an influence on visual system development, little information is available on the effects of dynamic light stimuli such as a strobe light on visual system development. Thus, this study was designed to evaluate changes caused by dynamic light stimuli during retinal development. This study used 80 Sprague-Dawley rats. From eye opening (postnatal day 14), half of the rats were maintained on a daily 12-h light/dark cycle (control group) and the remaining animals were raised under a 12-h strobe light (2 Hz)/dark cycle (strobe light-reared group). Morphological analyses and electroretinogram (ERG) were performed at postnatal weeks 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Among retinal neurons, tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-IR, dopaminergic amacrine cells) cells showed marked plastic changes, such as variations in numbers and soma sizes. In whole-mount preparations at 6, 8, and 10 weeks, type I TH-IR cells showed a decreased number and larger somata, while type II TH-IR cells showed an increased number in strobe-reared animals. Functional assessment by scotopic ERG showed that a-wave and b-wave amplitudes increased at 6 and 8 weeks in strobe-reared animals. These results show that exposure to a strobe light during development causes changes in TH-IR cell number and morphology, leading to a disturbance in normal visual functions.

Effective ecosystem monitoring requires a multi-scaled approach	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS			English	Article						ecosystem monitoring; targeted monitoring; surveillance monitoring; landscape monitoring; ecological questions; environmental change; biodiversity monitoring; research infrastructure; collaboration; environmental monitoring	SAMPLING EFFORT; OBSERVATION NETWORK; VEGETATION COVER; DESIGN ISSUES; FIELD DATA; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; INDICATORS; SATELLITE; FUTURE	Ecosystem monitoring is fundamental to our understanding of how ecosystem change is impacting our natural resources and is vital for developing evidence-based policy and management. However, the different types of ecosystem monitoring, along with their recommended applications, are often poorly understood and contentious. Varying definitions and strict adherence to a specific monitoring type can inhibit effective ecosystem monitoring, leading to poor program development, implementation and outcomes. In an effort to develop a more consistent and clear understanding of ecosystem monitoring programs, we here review the main types of monitoring and recommend the widespread adoption of three classifications of monitoring, namely, targeted, surveillance and landscape monitoring. Landscape monitoring is conducted over large areas, provides spatial data, and enables questions relating to where and when ecosystem change is occurring to be addressed. Surveillance monitoring uses standardised field methods to inform on what is changing in our environments and the direction and magnitude of that change, whilst targeted monitoring is designed around testable hypotheses over defined areas and is the best approach for determining the causes of ecosystem change. The classification system is flexible and can incorporate different interests, objectives, targets and characteristics as well as different spatial scales and temporal frequencies, while also providing valuable structure and consistency across distinct ecosystem monitoring programs. To support our argument, we examine the ability of each monitoring type to inform on six key types of questions that are routinely posed for ecosystem monitoring programs, such as where and when change is occurring, what is the magnitude of change, and how can the change be managed? As we demonstrate, each type of ecosystem monitoring has its own strengths and weaknesses, which should be carefully considered relative to the desired results. Using this scheme, scientists and land managers can design programs best suited to their needs. Finally, we assert that for our most serious environmental challenges, it is essential that we include information from each of these monitoring scales to inform on all facets of ecosystem change, and this is best achieved through close collaboration between the scales. With a renewed understanding of the importance of each monitoring type, along with greater commitment to monitor cooperatively, we will be well placed to address some of our greatest environmental challenges.

Analogous computations in working memory input, output and motor gating: Electrophysiological and computational modeling evidence	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							N-BACK TASK; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BASAL-GANGLIA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FRONTAL-CORTEX; INHIBITORY CONTROL; ACTION SELECTION; DECISION-MAKING; MECHANISMS	Adaptive cognitive-control involves a hierarchical cortico-striatal gating system that supports selective updating, maintenance, and retrieval of useful cognitive and motor information. Here, we developed a task that independently manipulates selective gating operations into working-memory (input gating), from working-memory (output gating), and of responses (motor gating) and tested the neural dynamics and computational principles that support them. Increases in gating demands, captured by gate switches, were expressed by distinct EEG correlates at each gating level that evolved dynamically in partially overlapping time windows. Further, categorical representations of specific maintained items and of motor responses could be decoded from EEG when the corresponding gate was switching, thereby linking gating operations to prioritization. Finally, gate switching at all levels was related to increases in the motor decision threshold as quantified by the drift diffusion model. Together these results support the notion that cognitive gating operations scaffold on top of mechanisms involved in motor gating. Author summary How do humans decide which information is relevant to attend to in memory, which cognitive operation to take, and when? Flexibly updating, maintenance and retrieval of relevant information from working memory (WM) are thought to be managed by gating computations in the frontostriatal network, supporting higher order learning and cognitive flexibility. Using the reference-back-2 task, we tested the key properties of gating. Namely that they are selective ("content-addressable") and that principles of cognitive "actions" (including input gating of WM, output gating from WM) are scaffold on top of the motor gating operations. Using trial-by-trial EEG indexing and quantitative computational modeling (the hierarchical drift-diffusion model) we showed that action selection at all three levels of gating have separable neural signatures but they operate partly in parallel, such that decisions about a response are processed to some degree even while the identity of the cognitive rule were uncertain. Furthermore, we showed analogous computations across levels of gating as selection of WM representation and of motor action lead to increase in the estimated decision threshold and to enhanced neural coding of the selected information thereby providing a novel link between WM gating and WM prioritization.

J	Lu, LM; Zeng, JC				Lu, Liming; Zeng, Jingchun			Evaluation of <i>K-ras</i> and <i>p53</i> expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma using the cancer genome atlas	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MUTATIONS; SURVIVAL; BIOMARKERS; PROTEIN	Genetic alterations in K-ras and p53 are thought to be critical in pancreatic cancer development and progression. However, K-ras and p53 expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma have not been systematically examined in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Data Portal. Information regarding K-ras and p53 alterations, mRNA expression data, and protein/protein phosphorylation abundance was retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases, and analyses were performed by the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. The mutual exclusivity analysis showed that events in K-ras and p53 were likely to co-occur in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Log odds ratio = 1.599, P = 0.006). The graphical summary of the mutations showed that there were hotspots for protein activation. In the network analysis, no solid association between K-ras and p53 was observed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In the survival analysis, neither K-ras nor p53 were associated with both survival events. As in the data mining study in the TCGA databases, our study provides a new perspective to understand the genetic features of K-ras and p53 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

We document the experience of Future Health Systems (FHS) Consortium research teams in Bangladesh, India and Uganda with using ToC. We seek to understand how and why ToCs were applied and to clarify how they facilitate the implementation of iterative intervention designs and stakeholder engagement in health systems research and strengthening. Methods: This paper combines literature on ToC, with a summary of reflections by FHS research members on the motivation, development, revision and use of the ToC, as well as on the benefits and challenges of the process. We describe three FHS teams' experiences along four potential uses of ToCs, namely planning, communication, learning and. accountability. Results: The three teams developed ToCs for planning and. evaluation purposes as required for their initial plans for FHS in 2011 and. revised, them half-way through the project, based on assumptions informed, by and adjusted, through the teams' experiences during the previous 2 years of implementation. All teams found that the revised ToCs and their accompanying narratives recognised greater feedback among intervention components and among key stakeholders. The ToC development and. revision fostered, channels for both internal and external communication, among research team members and. with key stakeholders, respectively. The process of revising the ToCs challenged the teams' initial assumptions based on new evidence and experience. In contrast, the ToCs were only minimally used for accountability purposes. Conclusions: The ToC development and revision process helped FHS research teams, and occasionally key local stakeholders, to reflect on and make their assumptions and mental models about their respective interventions explicit. Other projects using the ToC should allow time for revising and reflecting upon the ToCs, to recognise and document the adaptive nature of health systems, and to foster the time, space and flexibility that health systems strengthening programmes must have to learn from implementation and stakeholder engagement.

One problem is how to achieve equitable risk governance and management where there is low consensus on priorities, poor inclusion and coordination of risk assessment procedures, and a weak emphasis placed on cross-scale and sectoral interactions over time. Participatory system dynamics modeling processes and analyses are promising approaches for such challenges but are currently underutilized in nexus research and policy. This paper shares our experience implementing one such analysis in the Mekong river basin, a paradigmatic example for international nexus research. Our transdisciplinary research design combined participatory causal loop diagramming processes, scenario modeling, and a new resilience analysis method to identify and test anticipated water-energy-food risks in Kratie and Stung Treng provinces in northeastern Cambodia. Our process generated new understanding of potential cross-sectoral and cross-level risks from major hydropower development in the region. The results showed expected trade-offs between national level infrastructure programs and local level food security, but also some new insights into the effects local population increases may have on local food production and consumption even before hydropower developments are built. The analysis shows the benefit of evaluating risks in the nexus at different system levels and over time because of how system dynamics and inflection points are taken into account. Additionally, our case illustrates the contribution participatory system-thinking processes can make to risk assessment procedures for complex systems transitions. We originally anticipated that any new capacity reported by partners and participants would come from our modeling results produced at the end of the process. However, participants in the modeling procedures also found the experience powerful the information sharing, rapid risk assessment, and personal learning it enabled. A lesson from our experience reinforces a message from the transdisciplinary research field that has not yet been absorbed into the nexus research and policy field wholeheartedly: we do not have to wait for perfect data and incontestable results before making a positive contribution to anticipating and responding to risks that emerge from nexus relations if we apply participatory and systems-thinking informed approaches.

This work sought to understand the process involved in collective implementation of a health-related local action plan developed by multiple stakeholders. Methods Communities, government departments and non-government stakeholders convened in three iterative phases of a participatory action research (PAR) learning cycle. Stakeholders were involved in problem identification, development, and implementation of a local action plan, reflection on action, and reiteration of the process. Participants engaged in reflective exercises, exploring how factors such as power and interest impacted success or failure. Results The local action plan was partially successful, with three out of seven action items achieved. High levels of both power and interest were key factors in the achievement of action items. For the achieved items, stakeholders reported that continuous interactions with one another created a shift in both power and interest through ownership of implementation processes. Participants who possessed significant power and influence were able to leverage resources and connections to overcome obstacles and barriers to progress the plan. Lack of financial support, shifting priorities and insufficient buy-in from stakeholders hindered implementation. Conclusion The process offered new ways of thinking and stakeholders were supported to generate local evidence for action and learning. The process also enabled exploration of how different stakeholders with different levels of power and interest coalesce to design, plan, and act on evidence. Creation of safe spaces was achievable, meanwhile changing stakeholders' level of power and interest was possible but challenging. This study suggests that when researchers, service providers and communities are connected as legitimate participants in a learning platform with access to information and decision-making, a shift in power and interest may be feasible.

Methodology/Principal Findings: In the case of International HapMap Project, Epstein-Barr various immortalized cell lines were preferably used over blood in order to get a larger number of genomic DNA. However, genomic aberration stemming from immortalization process, biased representation of the donor tissue, and culture process may influence the accuracy of SNP genotypes. In order to identify chromosome aberrations including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), large-scale and small-scale copy number variations, we used Illumina HumanHap500 BeadChip (555,352 markers) on Korean HapMap individuals (n = 90) to obtain Log R ratio and B allele frequency information, and then utilized the data with various programs including Illumina ChromoZone, cnvParition and PennCNV. As a result, we identified 28 LOHs (>3 mb) and 35 large-scale CNVs (>1 mb), with 4 samples having completely duplicated chromosome. In addition, after checking the sample quality (standard deviation of log R ratio <0.30), we selected 79 samples and used both signal intensity and B allele frequency simultaneously for identification of small-scale CNVs (<1 mb) to discover 4,989 small-scale CNVs. Identified CNVs in this study were successfully validated using visual examination of the genoplot images, overlapping analysis with previously reported CNVs in DGV, and quantitative PCR. Conclusion/Significance: In this study, we describe the result of the identified chromosome aberrations in Korean HapMap individuals, and expect that these findings will provide more meaningful information on the human genome.

Design-Retrospective case series. Animals-176 dogs with epistaxis. Procedures-Medical records were reviewed for information related to signalment, clinical features, diagnosis, and outcome. Results-132 (75%) dogs were initially examined by the hospital's emergency service; prevalence of epistaxis was 0.3%. Dogs with epistaxis were more likely to be old ( ! 6 years), male, and large (>= 26 kg [58.5 lb]) than were dogs in a reference population. In 109 (62%) dogs with epistaxis, an underlying cause was identified; 115 underlying disorders were identified, with 90 classified as local and 25 classified as systemic. Local causes of epistaxis included nasal neoplasia (n = 35), trauma (33), idiopathic rhinitis (20), and periapical abscess (2). Systemic causes included thrombocytopenia (12), thrombocytopathia (7), coagulopathy (3), hypertension (2), and vasculitis (1). Dogs with local causes were more likely to have unilateral than bilateral epistaxis, but 11 of 21 (52%) dogs with systemic disorders also had unilateral epistaxis. Dogs with systemic disorders were more likely to have clinical signs of systemic disease. Duration of epistaxis (acute vs chronic), severity, and duration of hospitalization were similar for dogs with local versus systemic disorders. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results suggested that epistaxis was a common disorder in dogs and frequently regarded as an emergency. Local causes of epistaxis were predominant, but clinical features traditionally thought to be helpful in distinguishing local versus systemic causes could not be reliably used for this purpose.

A.; Curioni, Arianna; Constable, Merryn D.; Knoblich, Gunther; Charbonneau, Mathieu			Evaluating the relative contributions of copying and reconstruction processes in cultural transmission episodes	PLOS ONE			English	Article							JOINT ACTION; IMITATION; STABILITY	The ability to transmit information between individuals through social learning is a foundational component of cultural evolution. However, how this transmission occurs is still debated. On the one hand, the copying account draws parallels with biological mechanisms for genetic inheritance, arguing that learners copy what they observe and novel variations occur through random copying errors. On the other hand, the reconstruction account claims that, rather than directly copying behaviour, learners reconstruct the information that they believe to be most relevant on the basis of pragmatic inference, environmental and contextual cues. Distinguishing these two accounts empirically is difficult based on data from typical transmission chain studies because the predictions they generate frequently overlap. In this study we present a methodological approach that generates different predictions of these accounts by manipulating the task context between model and learner in a transmission episode. We then report an empirical proof-of-concept that applies this approach. The results show that, when a model introduces context-dependent embedded signals to their actions that are not intended to be transmitted, it is possible to empirically distinguish between competing predictions made by these two accounts. Our approach can therefore serve to understand the underlying cognitive mechanisms at play in cultural transmission and can make important contributions to the debate between preservative and reconstructive schools of thought.

Evidence for a Causal Role for Escherichia coli Strains Identified as Adherent-Invasive (AIEC) in Intestinal Inflammation	MSPHERE			English	Article; Early Access						inflammatory bowel disease; adherent-invasive E; coli; macrophages; epithelial cells; gnotobiotic mice	CROHNS-DISEASE PATIENTS; ILEAL MUCOSA; HIGH PREVALENCE; GUT MICROBIOTA; E. COLI; FIMH; MACROPHAGES; DIVERSITY; VIRULENCE; ABILITY	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an altered gut microbiota composition, including expansion of Proteobacteria. Many species in this phylum are thought to contribute to disease under certain conditions, including adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) strains, which are enriched in some patients. Enrichment of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) has been consistently detected in subsets of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Although some AIEC strains cause colitis in animal models, these studies did not systematically compare AIEC with non-AIEC strains, and causal links between AIEC and disease are still disputed. Specifically, it remains unclear whether AIEC shows enhanced pathogenicity compared to that of commensal E. coli found in the same ecological microhabitat and if the in vitro phenotypes used to classify strains as AIEC are pathologically relevant. Here, we utilized in vitro phenotyping and a murine model of intestinal inflammation to systematically compare strains identified as AIEC with those identified as non-AIEC and relate AIEC phenotypes to pathogenicity. Strains identified as AIEC caused, on average, more severe intestinal inflammation. Intracellular survival/replication phenotypes routinely used to classify AIEC positively correlated with disease, while adherence to epithelial cells and tumor necrosis factor alpha production by macrophages did not. This knowledge was then applied to design and test a strategy to prevent inflammation by selecting E. coli strains that adhered to epithelial cells but poorly survived/replicated intracellularly. Two E. coli strains that ameliorated AIEC-mediated disease were subsequently identified. In summary, our results show a relationship between intracellular survival/replication in E. coli and pathology in murine colitis, suggesting that strains possessing these phenotypes might not only become enriched in human IBD but also contribute to disease. We provide new evidence that specific AIEC phenotypes are pathologically relevant and proof of principle that such mechanistic information can be therapeutically exploited to alleviate intestinal inflammation.IMPORTANCE Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an altered gut microbiota composition, including expansion of Proteobacteria. Many species in this phylum are thought to contribute to disease under certain conditions, including adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) strains, which are enriched in some patients. However, whether this bloom contributes to disease or is just a response to IBD-associated physiological changes is unknown. Although assigning causality is challenging, appropriate animal models can test the hypothesis that AIEC strains have an enhanced ability to cause colitis in comparison to other gut commensal E. coli strains and to identify bacterial traits contributing to virulence. We observed that AIEC strains are generally more pathogenic than commensal E. coli and that bacterial intracellular survival/replication phenotypes contributed to disease.

There is still, however, a limited amount of information related to their sensory ecology and their subsequent ability to navigate through topographically complex landscapes, such as intertidal rocky shores, despite the documented role of substrate spatial structure in the movement rates and directionality of gastropods. Responses to gravity and visual cues have been documented in a range of intertidal gastropods, but often led to contradictory conclusions. We examined the response of the gastropod Littorina littorea, a keystone grazer on most temperate intertidal ecosystems of the northern hemisphere, to substrate slope, topographic discontinuities and light using purpose-designed experimental set-ups under laboratory-controlled conditions. In contrast to previous results, we showed that L. littorea did not exhibit a strict geotactic behaviour. Instead, they were predominantly thigmotactic following an encounter with a topographic discontinuity, and we suggest that the observed seemingly negative geotactic responses are only a by-product of thigmotaxis, i.e. a thigmotactically-induced negative geotactic response. L. littorea also showed a strong preference for dark areas and shapes. Taken together, our results suggest that thigmotaxis and scototaxis are evolutionary advantageous to navigate through topographically complex and thermally stressful environments, and that the behavioural repertoire of gastropod may be much wider than previously thought.

Strategy Selection Versus Flexibility: Using Eye-Trackers to Investigate Strategy Use During Mental Rotation	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION			English	Article						cognitive; sex differences; spatial; eye-movement; changepoint analysis	LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SPATIAL ABILITY; VISUAL WORLD; COMPREHENSION; METAANALYSIS; INFORMATION; COMPONENTS; MOVEMENTS	Spatial researchers have been arguing over the optimum cognitive strategy for spatial problem-solving for several decades. The current article aims to shift this debate from strategy dichotomies to strategy flexibility-a cognitive process, which although alluded to in spatial research, presents practical methodological challenges to empirical testing. In the current study, participants' eye movements were tracked during a mental rotation task (MRT) using the Tobii x60 eye-tracker. Results of a latent profile analysis, combining different eye movement parameters, indicated two distinct eye-patterns-fixating and switching patterns. The switching eye-pattern was associated with high mental rotation performance. There were no sex differences in eye-patterns. To investigate strategy flexibility, we used a novel application of the changepoint detection algorithm on eye movement data. Strategy flexibility significantly predicted mental rotation performance. Male participants demonstrated higher strategy flexibility than did female participants. Our findings highlight the importance of strategy flexibility in spatial thinking and have implications for designing spatial training techniques. The novel approaches to analyzing eye movement data in the current paper can be extended to research beyond the spatial domain.

Menus serve as communication tools between restaurants and their guests, representing the culinary philosophy of the chefs and proprietors involved. The purpose of this experimental lab study is to compare differences of attention paid to textual and pictorial elements of menus with metaphorical and/or metonymic names. Eye movement technology was applied in a 2 x 3 between-subject experiment (n = 40), comparing the strength of visual metaphors (e.g., images of menu items on the menu) and direct textual names in Chinese and English with regard to guests' willingness to purchase the dishes in question. Post-test questionnaires were also employed to assess participants' attitudes toward menu designs. Study results suggest that visual metaphors are more efficient when reflecting a product's strength. Images are shown to positively influence consumers' expectations of taste and enjoyment, garnering the most attention under all six conditions studied here, and constitute the most effective format when Chinese alone names are present. The textual claim increases perception of the strength of menu items along with purchase intention. Metaphorical dish names with bilingual (i.e., Chinese and English) names hold the greatest appeal. This result can be interpreted from the perspective of grounded cognition theory, which suggests that situated simulations and re-enactment of perceptual, motor, and affective processes can support abstract thought. The lab results and survey provide specific theoretical and managerial implications with regard to translating names of Chinese dishes to attract customers' attention to specific menu items.

Discovering drug targets through the web	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Experimental-Biology	JUL 11-15, 2005	Barcelona, SPAIN	Soc Expt Biol		drug; disease; drug target; bioinformatics; sequence comparison; text mining	RELATIONAL DATABASE; GENOME ANNOTATION; INFORMATION; BIOINFORMATICS; RESOURCES; SYSTEM; GENES	Traditionally, drug-target discovery is a "wet-bench" experimental process, depending on carefully designed genetic screens, biochemical tests and cellular assays to identify proteins and genes that are associated with a particular disease or condition. However, recent advances in DNA sequencing, transcript profiling, protein identification and protein quantification are leading to a flood of genomic and proteomic data that is, or potentially could be, linked to disease data. The quantity of data generated by these high throughput methods is forcing scientists to re-think the way they do traditional drug-target discovery. In particular it is leading them more and more towards identifying potential drug targets using computers. In fact, drug-target identification is now being done as much on the desk-top as on the bench-top. This review focuses on describing how drug-target discovery can be done in silico (i.e. via computer) using a variety of bioinformatic resources that are freely available on the web. Specifically, it highlights a number of web-accessible sequence databases, automated genome annotation tools, text mining tools; and integrated drug/sequence databases that can be used to identify drug targets for both endogenous (genetic and epigenctic) diseases as well as exogenous (infectious) diseases.

Modelling the Impact of Media-Induced Social Distancing on the Containment of COVID-19 in Beijing	DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY			English	Article							OUTBREAK; PHASE	With the multiple waves of COVID-19 in China and other countries, there is an urgent need to design effective containment, especially nonpharmaceutical interventions, to combat the transmission. Media reports on COVID-19-which can induce precautionary behaviour such as social distancing, by providing disease-related information to the public-are thought to be effective in containing the spread. We include the media-reporting data collected from authoritative and popular websites, along with the corresponding IP-visiting data, to study the effects of media reports in curbing the outbreak of COVID-19 in Beijing. To quantify how social distancing affects the spread of COVID-19, we differentiate the fully susceptible from those susceptibles who are media aware and practice social distancing or are quarantined. We propose a discrete compartment model with the fully susceptible, the media-aware susceptible, and the quarantined susceptible as three separate classes. We adopt functions dependent on the media reports and the contacts of media-aware susceptibles to describe the progression rate of susceptibles to media-aware susceptibles. By fitting the targeted model to data on the two Beijing outbreaks, we estimated the reproduction numbers for the two outbreaks as R0=1.6818 and R0=1.3251, respectively. Cross-correlation analysis on our collected data suggests a strong correlation between the media reporting and epidemic case data. Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis show that even with the intensified interventions in force, reducing either the social distancing uptake rate or the average duration of social distancing for media-aware susceptibles could aggravate the severity of the two outbreaks in Beijing by magnifying the final confirmed cases and lengthening the end time of the pandemic. Our findings demonstrate that enhancing social distancing and media reporting alone, if done in sufficient measures, are enough to alleviate the COVID-19 epidemic.

Development of a rapid matrix digestion technique for ultrastructural analysis of elastic fibers in the intervertebral disc	JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS			English	Article						Annulus fibrosus; Elastic fibers; Digestion; Scanning electron microscopy; Architecture; Ultra-structure	LUMBAR ANULUS FIBROSUS; ANNULUS FIBROSUS; MECHANICAL FUNCTION; COLLAGEN-FIBERS; ARCHITECTURE; NETWORKS; LIGAMENT; TISSUE	Collagen and elastic fibers are two major fibrous constituents of the annulus fibrosus (AF) in the disc that contribute to its mechanical and viscoelastic properties. It was thought that elastic fibers play no substantial role in the function and properties of the disc as these fibers were irregularly distributed. Studies that have revealed highly organized elastic fibers with different regional orientation and distribution, while being strongly crosslinked with matrix, suggesting their contribution to disc structure-function properties. These studies that were performed by light microscopic analysis of histologically prepared samples, have not been able to reveal the fine-scale architectural details of the elastic fiber network. Since elastic fibers are intermingled with other fibrous components of the disc and mostly obscured by the extracellular matrix, it is difficult to demonstrate their ultra-structural organization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Therefore the aim of this study was to develop a rapid matrix digestion technique for ultrastructural analysis of the disc elastic fibers. This study provides a new method for fundamental visualization of elastic fibers and their architecture in the disc. Through the ultra-structural analysis, the relationship between structure and function, as well as the role of elastic fibers on AF mechanical properties can be studied. This method may be used to develop a three-dimensional map of elastic fibers distribution within the disc, which would provide valuable information for designing tissue engineered scaffolds for AF repair and replacement.

The expansion of MINDSET added goal setting and strategy selection to improve self-management (S-M) in PWE. The previous study tested the feasibility of English MINDSET, which was designed to facilitate the identification and discussion of S-M issues between the patient and healthcare provider (HCP) during a regular clinic visit. Results indicate MINDSET feasibility for use in the following: 1) identifying S-M issues across several domains; 2) selecting and assessing confidence in tailored S-M goals/strategies for improvement; 3) discussing S-M issues/ goals/strategies/confidence with a HCP: and 4) creating an action plan (AP) and tracking achievement during regular clinic visits. Across two visits, 80-90% of patients agreed that the revised version of MINDSET was helpful, understandable, trustworthy, promoted careful thinking about management, was of appropriate duration, and would be helpful in future management and communication with HCP. Participating HCPs agreed that MINDSET improved the ease, thoroughness, and accuracy in identifying patient S-M issues and establishing a plan for improvement. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Current practice often relies on the proband to inform relatives about the possibility of predictive DNA testing, but not all relatives are informed adequately. To enable informed decision-making concerning predictive DNA testing, the approach used to inform at-risk relatives needs to be optimized. This study investigated the preferences of patients, relatives, and the general population from the Netherlands on how to inform relatives at risk of autosomal dominant diseases. Online surveys were sent to people with autosomal dominant neuro-, onco-, or cardiogenetic diseases and their relatives via patient organizations (n = 379), and to members of the general population via a commercial panel (n = 1,000). Attitudes of the patient and population samples generally corresponded. A majority believed that initially only first-degree relatives should be informed, following the principles of a cascade screening approach. Most participants also thought that probands and healthcare professionals (HCPs) should be involved in informing relatives, and a large proportion believed that HCPs should contact relatives directly in cases where patients are unwilling to inform, both for untreatable and treatable conditions. Participants from the patient sample were of the opinion that HCPs should actively offer support. Our findings show that both patients and HCPs should be involved in informing at-risk relatives of autosomal dominant diseases and suggest that relatives' 'right to know' was considered a dominant issue by the majority of participants. Further research is needed on how to increase proactive support in informing of at-risk relatives.

Evaluating co-created patient-facing materials to increase understanding of genetic test results	JOURNAL OF GENETIC COUNSELING			English	Article						genetic testing; health literacy; patient education; patient&#8208; centered care; reading comprehension	CONGENITAL HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM; LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY; ERA	Patients often have difficulty understanding genetic test reports. Technical language and jargon can impede comprehension and limit patients using results to act on findings. One potential way to improve patient understanding of genetic test reports is to provide patient-facing materials. This study aimed to examine understandability and actionability of co-created patient-facing materials for genetic test results in a research context. We combined interprofessional perspectives and patient engagement to co-create patient-facing materials for patients undergoing research genetic testing for congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Kallmann syndrome). The iterative development process was guided by principles of health literacy and human-centered design (i.e., design thinking). Readability was assessed using eight validated algorithms. Patients and parents evaluated materials using a web-based survey. The gold standard Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for print materials (PEMAT-P) was employed to measure understandability (content, style, use of numbers, organization, design, use of visual aids) and actionability. PEMAT-P scores >80% were considered high quality. Results were analyzed descriptively and correlations performed to identify relationships between education/health literacy and PEMAT-P ratings. A consensus score of eight algorithms indicated the materials were an 8(th)-9th grade reading level. Our findings are consistent with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 'average difficulty' classification (i.e., 7th-9th grade). In total, 61 patients/parents evaluated the materials. 'Visual Aids' received the lowest mean PEMAT-P rating (89%). All other parameters scored 90%-97%. PEMAT-P scores did not differ according to educational attainment (less than college vs. college or more, p = 0.28). Participants with adequate health literacy were more likely to approve of the 'organization' of information (p < 0.05). Respondents with low health literacy had more favorable views of 'visual aids' (p < 0.01). Involving patients in a co-creation process can produce high-quality patient-facing materials that are easier to understand.

That work takes up and applies specialized disciplinary and practice-based language (e.g., planning and engineering) and concepts that are used to describe, measure, and design the built environment. In this paper, we explore dif-ferences in how parents think about the built environment and school transport and the ways in which the built environment and transport are conceptualized in planning. The presence of conceptual asymmetry between a scholar's "model" and the "lived experience" of parents and children may have implications for the efficacy of school travel-related policy and planning. We use Bronfenbrenner's social ecological model to guide a thematic analysis of 37 interviews with parents about school travel behaviour in Toronto, Canada. We found that parents' experiences of the built environment are complex and varied, with different features influencing individual parents differently, and at varying levels of the ecological model. For example, mixed-use development, often held up as a necessary condition for tackling automobility, was cited as a desirable aesthetic background for driving. We were able to locate examples of conceptual asymmetry but also agreement - particularly about traffic around schools. For example, parents expressed divergent views on the impact of heavy traffic on walking, with some describing traffic and traffic safety as barriers to walking, while others indicated that resistance to driving in traffic motivated a choice to walk. Our study serves as a call to planners and geographers to better attend to the lay, everyday onto-epistemologies that shape parents' lived experiences of travel to school.

J	Akinoso, SO				Akinoso, Sabainah Oyebola			Mathematics Teachers Awareness of Teachable Moments in Nigerian Classroom	EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						teachable moments; mathematics classroom; awareness; management; use		Mathematics, being the core subject that has its application in every other subject should be given special attention. Despite the importance of mathematics, students are not performing in the subject. Students view mathematics in abstract form. Ways of improving the teaching and learning of mathematics should be the concern of the stakeholders. A lot of research work were reported on teaching strategies, but the problem of poor performance has not been reduced to minimal level. Students thinking and error made in class can be used to create teachable moments. This study investigated whether the teachers of mathematics in Nigeria are aware, managing and using teachable moments when occur in mathematics class. The study is a descriptive research of the survey type. The sample consisted of 98 mathematics teachers randomly selected from thirty secondary schools from both Lagos and Oyo states of Nigeria. A researcher-designed of effective management of Teachable Moments which consists of 3 parts was used to collect data from the respondents. The first section of the questionnaire was used to elicit general information on teachers' demographical data. The 3 parts of the second section include awareness of teachable moment (ATM), Management of Teachable Moment with resources (MTM) and Use of Teachable Moments (UTM). All instruments were validated. The reliability coefficient of ATM, MTM and UTM using Cronbach alpha were 0.72, 0.78 and 0.69 respectively. Means and standard deviation were used to analyze the data. It was discovered that the means of the awareness and management instruments were greater than the baseline mean (2.5). Teachers are aware, can manage but are not using the moments due to time constraint. This indicated that mathematics teachers in Nigeria are aware of teachable moments, managing the moments effectively but have not been using teachable moments.

Design A meta-summary and a meta-synthesis based upon a systematic review of qualitative studies. Sample The Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, MEDLINE, and Scopus databases were all searched up to April 2020. Measurements The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed; then, the methodological quality of the studies included was assessed with the Critical Appraisal Screening Programme tool for qualitative studies. Results Five studies have been included documenting the experience of 125 adult individuals. A total of 16 codes emerged: in the meta-summary, the most and least frequent codes were "Thinking about quarantine" (80%) and "Emotional roller coaster," "Being alert for any symptom," "Trusting or not?," "Knowing who brought the infection," and "Living in a surreal world" (20%). The codes which emerged were categorized into three main themes which summarized the whole experience of being placed in quarantine: (a) "Being swamped with a thousand emotions"; (b) "Being restrained"; and (c) "Needing to be considered." Conclusions The experience of quarantine for people is a long journey which can feel chaotic due to uncertainty about the consequences on health, work, and the future. The findings of this study can help nurses in caring for quarantined individuals by enabling them to understand people's need for educational and emotional support. Ensuring the supply of consistent information is also important to increase people's compliance.

There are two interrelated areas that policymakers can consider in relation to climate change and homelessness: migration and exposure. This synthesis of the available data and expert opinion provides practical information to policymakers, with specific strategies alongside case examples. The data captured here is through systematic reviews, and expert opinion is generated through input from a year-long series of five virtual think tanks. Throughout this synthesis paper, an emphasis is placed on explicitly addressing homeless populations in the policies and plans designed to address climate change-related impacts. Prevention-oriented plans are shown to be more effective in terms of outcomes and cost-effectiveness compared to the more commonly deployed crisis response models. Another key issue considered is the availability of relevant data with which to target policy responses and evaluate outcomes. Data-driven responses tend to be more successful, though relevant data are, to date, lacking for homeless and other marginalized populations. Moreover, effective policy design in this area needs to be intersectional and inclusive, tailored to the needs of local communities and developed in consultation with lived experience stakeholders, including service providers. Policies that ignore local input tend to fail. Prevention-oriented, culturally-situated, and trauma-informed systems and services hold the greatest promise in responding to the severe health risks and inequities that homeless populations face in the climate crisis.Key policy insightsPrevention-oriented measures are key, with most focussing on the availability of affordable housing and upgrading housing and living conditions of vulnerable populations.There is a need to include lived experience and input from local communities, especially when designing measures that will impact livelihoods, such as planned migration.Disaster, crisis response, and aftercare plans need to outline explicit measures for homeless populations.There is a need for cross-sectoral alignment of policy and intervention responses.Successful approaches tend to be culturally-situated and trauma-informed.

J	Goel, S; Kumar, R				Goel, Shubham; Kumar, Ravinder			SoTaRePo: Society-Tag Relationship Protocol based architecture for UIP construction	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Social network; Social tagging; Protocol; Ranking; Recommendations	PERSONALIZING WEB SEARCH; SOCIAL BOOKMARKING; RESOURCE PROFILES; USER PROFILES; SYSTEMS	As with the advancement of web services, there has been a rapid proliferation in web size and number of web users, where, each user holds a different viewpoint towards the same information. This, in turn, has become a big challenge for the web search platforms to interpret the preferences of the users and provide the desired information to them. The most suitable solution to the problem of search platforms is personalization of web search. A personalization system is a kind of expert and intelligent system which can automatically learn about the preferences of a user so that the system can provide the search results as per their relevance to a user. The process of acquiring knowledge about user's preferences by a personalization system is known as User Interest Profile (UIP). In the field of search personalization, it can also not be denied that only an efficient and complete UIP can lead to an effective and high performing web search personalization methodology design. But most of the studies conducted for web search personalization have only focused on UIP modeling without any thought about the quality of UIP. Rather limited attention has been paid to sparsity issue of UIP modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol based architecture model to create an efficient UIP by exploiting direct and indirect interest of a user. Direct interest aims at mining user's preferences from his own activities on a social information platform. The explicitly defined society and real-world activity relationships of a user on a social platform are used to predict his indirect interest as UIP constructed solely on the basis of direct interest is sparse and ineffective. In order to unearth user's activity relationships the concept of semantic relatedness, computed using Word2vec model, has been used. Moreover, different trust levels in society relationships have also been incorporated into the proposed model to facilitate the prediction of user's indirect interest.

This conformable material simultaneously collects signals from external stimuli that translate into information such as pressure, pain, and temperature. The development of an electronic material, inspired by the complexity of this organ is a tremendous, unrealized engineering challenge. However, the advent of carbon-based electronics may offer a potential solution to this long-standing problem. In this Account, we describe the use of an organic field-effect transistor (OFET) architecture to transduce mechanical and chemical stimuli Into electrical signals. In developing this mimic of human skin, we thought of the sensory elements of the OFET as analogous to the various layers and constituents of skin. In this fashion, each layer of the OFET can be optimized to carry out a specific recognition function. The separation of multimodal sensing among the components of the OFET may be considered a "divide and conquer" approach, where the electronic skin (e-skin) can take advantage of the optimized chemistry and materials properties of each layer. This design of a novel microstructured gate dielectric has led to unprecedented sensitivity for tactile pressure events. Typically, pressure-sensitive components within electronic configurations have suffered from a lack of sensitivity or long mechanical relaxation times often associated with elastomeric materials. Within our method, these components are directly compatible with OFETs and have achieved the highest reported sensitivity to date. Moreover, the tactile sensors operate on a time scale comparable with human skin, making them ideal candidates for integration as synthetic skin devices. The methodology is compatible with large-scale fabrication and employs simple, commercially available elastomers. The design of materials within the semiconductor layer has led to the incorporation of selectivity and sensitivity within gassensing devices and has enabled stable sensor operation within aqueous media. Furthermore, careful tuning of the chemical composition of the dielectric layer has provided a means to operate the sensor in real time within an aqueous environment and without the need for encapsulation layers. The integration of such devices as electronic mimics of skin will require the incorporation of biocompatible or biodegradable components. Toward this goal, OFETs may be fabricated with >99% biodegradable components by weight, and the devices are robust and stable, even In aqueous environments. Collectively, progress to date suggests that OFETs may be integrated within a single substrate to function as an electronic mimic of human skin, which could enable a large range of sensing-related applications from novel prosthetics to robotic surgery.

J	Lilja, A; DeMarinis, V; Lehti, A; Forssén, A				Lilja, Aina; DeMarinis, Valerie; Lehti, Arja; Forssen, Annika			Experiences and explanations of mental ill health in a group of devout Christians from the ethnic majority population in secular Sweden: a qualitative study	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							DEPRESSION; LIFE; SPIRITUALITY; RELIGION; PEOPLE; EUROPE; CANCER; BRAIN; REFLECTIONS; PERSPECTIVE	Objective: To explore existential meaning-making in an ethnic-majority subgroup with mental ill health and to increase knowledge about the importance of gaining access to such information in mental healthcare. Design: Qualitative study using in-depth interviews and systematic text condensation analysis. Participants: 17 devote Christians with an ethnicSwedish background, 12 women and 5 men, 30-73 years old, from different congregations across Sweden, having sought medical care for mental ill health of any kind. Setting: The secular Swedish society. Results: A living, although asymmetric, relationship with God often was seen as the most important relationship, giving hope and support when ill, but creating feelings of abandonment and fear if perceived as threatened. Symptoms were interpreted through an existential framework influenced by their view of God. A perceived judging God increased feelings of guilt, sinfulness and shame. A perceived merciful God soothed symptoms and promoted recovery. Existential consequences, such as being unable to pray or participate in congregational rituals, caused feelings of ` spiritual homelessness'. Participants gave biopsychosocial explanations of their mental ill health, consonant with and sometimes painfully conflicting with existential explanations, such as being attacked by demons. Three different patterns of interaction among biopsychosocial and existential dimensions in their explanatory systems of illness causation were identified: (a) comprehensive thinking and consensus; (b) division and parallel functions and (c) division and competitive functions. Conclusions: Prevailing medical models for understanding mental ill health do not include the individual's existential experiences, which are important for identifying risk and protective factors as well as possible resources for recovery. The various expressions of existential meaning-making identified in this devout religious subgroup illustrate that existential information cannot be generalised, even within a small, seemingly homogenous group. The three identified patterns of interactions formed a typology that may be of use in clinical settings.

Methylphenidate and brain activity in a reward/conflict paradigm: Role of the insula in task performance	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						fMRI; Stimulants; Insula; Reward; Attention	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CINGULATE CORTEX; NETWORKS; PLACEBO; CONNECTIVITY; ATOMOXETINE; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; MOTIVATION; ABUSE	Psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate, are thought to improve information processing in motivation-reward and attention-activation networks by enhancing the effects of more relevant signals and suppressing those of less relevant ones; however the nature of such reciprocal influences remains poorly understood. To explore this question, we tested the effect of methylphenidate on performance and associated brain activity in the Anticipation, Conflict, Reward (ACR) task. Sixteen healthy adult volunteers, ages 21-45, were scanned twice using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as they performed the ACR task under placebo and methylphenidate conditions. A three-way repeated measures analysis of variance, with cue (reward vs. non-reward), target (congruent vs. incongruent) and medication condition (methylphenidate vs. placebo) as the factors, was used to analyze behaviors on the task. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals, reflecting task-related neural activity, were evaluated using linear contrasts. Participants exhibited significantly greater accuracy in the methylphenidate condition than the placebo condition. Compared with placebo, the methylphenidate condition also was associated with lesser task-related activity in components of attention-activation systems irrespective of the reward cue, and less task-related activity in components of the reward-motivation system, particularly the insula, during reward trials irrespective of target difficulty. These results suggest that methylphenidate enhances task performance by improving efficiency of information processing in both reward-motivation and in attention-activation systems.

J	Swain, DE; Lightfoot, JE				Swain, Deborah Elizabeth; Lightfoot, James Earl			A knowledge management framework for global project development based on Tai Chi principles and practices	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Project management; Knowledge management; Framework; Global product development; Health and wellness; Tai Chi	ENTERPRISES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show how Tai Chi (or T'ai Chi ch'uan) philosophy might be used in global project development. Collected case studies support a Tai Chi-based framework for global project teams to reduce stress and improve decision making through exercises, storytelling, and martial arts practices. The authors first proposed a model or procedural framework based on experiential knowledge from practicing Tai Chi while managing projects. Design/methodology/approach - Analyzing case studies from knowledge managers, project managers, and executive leaders, the researchers collected data on applying the framework from a retrospective case study and from two observational case studies during project development. Tai Chi-based communications and exercises were shown to support critical thinking, knowledge sharing, and problem solving. The proposed framework and four-step procedure build on a global perspective to cultural awareness, creativity, and motivation as well as specific Tai Chi-based tactics, techniques, and operations for knowledge management. This preliminary study looks at improving collaboration in a competitive environment while supporting health, wellness, and work-life enjoyment. Findings - Early research results suggest that teams and individuals working on projects and practicing Tai Chi might develop more cohesive strategies and improve soft skills during their integration of Eastern and Western philosophies. Research limitations/implications - Used case studies methodology, which provided examples of using Tai Chi during projects. Qualitative data used to develop the proposed framework. Also, interviews and discussion reviews conducted for additional validation collected on framework. Practical implications - It is a pioneering, preliminary study. Future research with outcomes-based data from project managers using Tai Chi recommended. Originality/value - The integration of Eastern and Western philosophies into a framework for team project and knowledge management was shown to support cohesive strategies, improve soft skills, and strengthen decision making.

This study explored the suicide-related online behaviour of two contrasting samples of distressed users, focusing on their purpose, methods and the main content viewed. In-depth interviews were conducted in the UK between 2014-2016 with i) young people in the community; and ii) self-harm patients presenting to hospital emergency departments. Data were analysed using methods of constant comparison. Suicide-related internet use varied according to the severity of suicidal feelings. In the young people sample, where severity was lower, use was characterised by disorganised browsing without clear purpose. A range of content was 'stumbled upon' including information about suicide methods. They also pursued opportunities to interact with others and explore online help. Self-harm patients were a higher severity group with a history of suicidal behaviour. Their use was purposeful and strategic, focused around 'researching' suicide methods to maximise effectiveness. They made specific choices about content viewed; many consulting factual content in preference to user generated accounts, while help content and communication was avoided. Findings indicate further action is necessary to improve online safety. Also, novel online help approaches are needed to engage individuals experiencing suicidal crisis. Awareness of the nature of suicide-related internet use and how this may reflect the status of an individual's suicidal thinking could be beneficial to clinicians to promote safety and indicate risk.

It has been recognised as one of the promising candidate antigens for a blood-stage malaria vaccine. Genetic structure of PfMSP-1(42) has been considered to be largely conserved in the P. falciparum population. However, only limited information is currently available. This study aimed to analyse genetic diversity and the effect of natural selection on PfMSP-1(42) among the Myanmar P. falciparum population and compare them with publicly available PfMSP-1(42) from global P. falciparum populations. Methods: A total of 69 P. falciparum clinical isolates collected from Myanmar malaria patients in Upper Myanmar in 2015 were used. The PfMSP-1(42) region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned and sequenced. Genetic structure and natural selection of this region were analysed using MEGA4 and DnaSP programs. Polymorphic nature and natural selection in global PfMSP-1(42) were also investigated. Results: All three allele types (MAD20, K1, and R033) of PfMSP-1 42 were identified in Myanmar isolates of P. falciparum. Myanmar PfMSP-1(42) displayed genetic diversity. Most polymorphisms were scattered in blocks 16 and 17. Polymorphisms observed in Myanmar PfMSP-1(42) showed a similar pattern to those of global PfMSP1(42); however, they were not identical to each other. Genetic diversity of Myanmar PfMSP-1(42) was relatively lower than that of PfMSP-1(42) from different geographical regions. Evidence of natural selection and recombination were found. Comparative analysis of genetic polymorphism and natural selection in the global PfMSP-1(42) population suggested that this region was not tightly conserved in global PfMSP-1(42) as previously thought and is under the complicated influence of natural selection and recombination. Conclusions: Global PfMSP-1(42) revealed limited, but non-negligible, genetic diversity by allele types and geographical origins. Complicated natural selection and potential recombination might have occurred in global PfMSP-1(42). Comprehensive monitoring of genetic diversity for global PfMSP-1(42) would be needed to better understand the polymorphic nature and evolutionary aspect of PfMSP-1(42 )in the global P. falciparum population.

At present, a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation with information technology at its core is accelerating. The challenge of new economy and new industry has put forward new requirements for the training of talents in China. The challenges of new economy and new industry have put forward new requirements for the cultivation of engineering talents in China. Based on corpus, this study constructed a model of intelligent English teaching assisted by virtual corpus. The traditional teaching of college English reading is based on, around, and for texts. Using DDL model, teachers can break the limitation of textbooks. On the basis of analyzing the general idea of the text, they can search out massive real corpus related to the general idea of the text by searching the core words in the text, so as to provide extensive reading resources for students in the maximum range. At the same time, teachers can rely on the corpus to design different types of teaching activities, realize student-centered task-based, inquiry-based, and autonomous learning and cultivate students' critical thinking ability, practical ability, and cross-cultural communication ability. This model breaks the limitation of "classroom + textbook," realizes student-centered task-based, exploratory, and autonomous learning, trains interdisciplinary new engineering talents needed by emerging industries and new economy in the future, and promotes the sustainable development of English teaching. Corpus-data-driven college English teaching mode breaks the limitation of "classroom + textbook," changes the traditional college English teaching mode, and realizes student-centered task-oriented, inquiry-based, and autonomous learning.

Design: A qualitative study using the Nominal Group Technique (a highly structured meeting to gain information from experts about a particular issue) was conducted between August 2002 and September 2003. GPs in six discussion groups were asked "What do you think is needed to achieve best outcomes for asthma care?" To augment analysis of the discussion, sessions were taped and transcribed. Participants: Forty-nine GPs were recruited: 34 from metropolitan and 15 from rural areas. Results: All groups nominated asthma education for patients and continuing professional education for GPs as major priorities, but they also described educational and structural barriers to achieving these priorities. Other priorities were: medication adherence, facilitating regular patient review, negotiated treatment/management plans, making the correct diagnosis, increased remuneration and consultation time, and safer asthma medications and access to these. Health promotion initiatives and increased public awareness were also priorities. Spirometry was a significant cause of uncertainty. Overall, written asthma action plans were not considered a high priority. Conclusions: Remarkable consistency was found between GPs' priorities for delivering best asthma care. Our study identified barriers to asthma guideline adherence, including accessible, relevant education for GPs, and structural, time and cost barriers GPs must overcome in providing asthma treatment and patient education.

Manganese deception on graphene and implications in catalysis	CARBON			English	Article						Metal-free catalyst; Oxygen reduction reaction; Heteroatom-doped graphene; Metal-free graphene	OXYGEN REDUCTION REACTION; NITROGEN-DOPED GRAPHENE; METALLIC IMPURITIES; EFFICIENT; CARBON; ELECTROCATALYST; MNO2; NANOCRYSTALS; NANORIBBONS; PERFORMANCE	Heteroatom-doped metal-free graphene has been widely studied as the catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Depending on the preparation method and the dopants, the ORR activity varies ranging from a two-electron to a four-electron pathway. The different literature reports are difficult to correlate due to the large variances. However, due to the potential metal contamination, the origin of the ORR activity from "metal-free" graphene remains confusing and inconclusive. Here we decipher the ORR catalytic activities of diverse architectures on graphene derived from reduced graphene oxide. High angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and trace elemental analysis methods are employed. The mechanistic origin of ORR activity is associated with the trace manganese content and reaches its highest performance at an onset potential of 0.94 V when manganese exists as a mononuclear-centered structure within defective graphene. This study exposes the deceptive role of trace metal in formerly thought to be metal-free graphene materials. It also provides insight into the design of better-performing catalyst for ORR by underscoring the coordination chemistry possible for future single-atom catalyst materials. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A key species of the Southern Ocean ecosystem, the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has evolved rhythmic physiological and behavioral mechanisms to adapt to daily and seasonal changes. The molecular organization of the clockwork underlying these biological rhythms is, nevertheless, still only partially understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: The genome sequence of the Antarctic krill is not yet available. A normalized cDNA library was produced and pyrosequenced in the attempt to identify large numbers of transcripts. All available E. superba sequences were then assembled to create the most complete existing oligonucleotide microarray platform with a total of 32,217 probes. Gene expression signatures of specimens collected in the Ross Sea at five different time points over a 24-hour cycle were defined, and 1,308 genes differentially expressed were identified. Of the corresponding transcripts, 609 showed a significant sinusoidal expression pattern; about 40% of these exibithed a 24-hour periodicity while the other 60% was characterized by a shorter (about 12-hour) rhythm. We assigned the differentially expressed genes to functional categories and noticed that those concerning translation, proteolysis, energy and metabolic process, redox regulation, visual transduction and stress response, which are most likely related to daily environmental changes, were significantly enriched. Two transcripts of peroxiredoxin, thought to represent the ancestral timekeeping system that evolved about 2.5 billion years ago, were also identified as were two isoforms of the EsRh1 opsin and two novel arrestin1 sequences involved in the visual transduction cascade. Conclusions: Our work represents the first characterization of the krill diurnal transcriptome under natural conditions and provides a first insight into the genetic regulation of physiological changes, which occur around the clock during an Antarctic summer day.

The controlling and interaction approach plays a key role in users' experience and turns into one of the most important selling points for profit growth. Considering the robustness and privacy protection, wearable devices equipped with MEMS, e.g., smartphones, smartwatches, or smart wristbands, are thought of one of the most feasible commercial solutions for interaction. However, the low-cost built-in MEMS sensors do not perform well in capturing finely grained human activity directly. In this paper, we propose a method that leverages the arm constraint and historical information recorded by MEMS sensors to estimate the maximum likelihood action in a two-phases model. First, in the arm posture estimation phase, we leverage the kinematics model to analyze the maximum likelihood position of users' arms. Second, in the trajectory recognition phase, we leverage the gesture estimation model to identify the key actions and output the instructions to devices by SVM. Our substantial experiments show that the proposed solution can recognize eight kinds of postures defined for man-machine interaction in the smart home application scene, and the solution implements efficient and effective interaction using low-cost smartwatches, and the interaction accuracy is >87%. The experiments also show that the algorithm proposed in this paper can be well applied to the perceptual control of smart household appliances, and has high practical value for the application design of the perceptual interaction function of household appliances.

Night and day: Shrinking and swelling of stems of diverse mangrove species growing along environmental gradients	PLOS ONE			English	Article							WATER STORAGE; DIAMETER VARIATIONS; AVICENNIA-MARINA; WOOD DENSITY; LONG-TERM; PATTERNS; PRESSURE; DYNAMICS; CARBON; DENDROMETER	Tree stems swell and shrink daily, which is thought to reflect changes in the volume of water within stem tissues. We observed these daily patterns using automatic dendrometer bands in a diverse group of mangrove species over five mangrove forests across Australia and New Caledonia. We found that mangrove stems swelled during the day and shrank at night. Maximum swelling was highly correlated with daily maxima in air temperature. Variation in soil salinity and levels of tidal inundation did not influence the timing of stem swelling over all species. Medium-term increases in stem circumference were highly sensitive to rainfall. We defoliated trees to assess the role of foliar transpiration in stem swelling and shrinking. Defoliated trees showed maintenance of the pattern of daytime swelling, indicating that processes other than canopy transpiration influence the temporary stem diameter increments, which could include thermal swelling of stems.

Using Situated Learning Theory to Build an Interactive Learning Environment to Foster Dental Students' Professionalism: An Ignite Project	JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION			English	Article						dental education; educational methodology; learning environment; situated learning; professionalism; ethics	QUADRUPLE AIM CARE; EDUCATION	Recognition that professionalism is at the heart of dentistry's contract with society has led to an emphasis on educational strategies designed to improve cultivation of professional behaviors. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a project based on situated learning theory and using an Ignite format to support dental students' learning and promote professionalism. Learning activities were evaluated in terms of new thinking, changing perspectives, and professional relationships. Professional relationship development and professional self-identity were explored. First-year dental students (n=108) enrolled in a two-semester professional development course at one U.S. dental school in fall 2017 comprised the study sample; all participated in the study. The mixed-methods study design used simultaneous triangulation with the qualitative component adding insight to the evaluation results. A 25-question evaluation form was used to collect quantitative data, and student self-assessment essays provided qualitative information. On the survey, the students' responses were generally agree/strongly agree and ranged from 60% (creating the presentation, changed perspective on academic integrity) to 98% (interaction and discussion with facilitators, appreciate professional relationships beyond dental school). Four themes emerged from content analysis of the essays: Behavior and Consequences: Academic Integrity and Professionalism, Patient Trust: Conflicts of Interest, Professional Interactions, and Professional Standards and Reputation. Overall, this Ignite project was found to advance the desired learning goals with respect to initial professional development. The social interactions with peers and outside practitioners facilitated introspection and learning. Students saw themselves as part of a profession, they started to appreciate and develop professional relationships, and many left the event with a deeper understanding of issues related to academic integrity, professional behavior, and conflicts of interests in dental practice.

Novel Mechanism of Antibodies to Hepatitis B Virus in Blocking Viral Particle Release from Cells	HEPATOLOGY			English	Article							HUMAN MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; I-RELATED RECEPTOR; SURFACE-ANTIGEN; LIVER-TRANSPLANTATION; NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES; IMMUNE GLOBULIN; LINE; INFECTION; THERAPY; LAMIVUDINE	Antibodies are thought to exert antiviral activities by blocking viral entry into cells and/or accelerating viral clearance from circulation. In particular, antibodies to hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) confer protection, by binding circulating virus. Here, we used mathematical modeling to gain information about viral dynamics during and after single or multiple infusions of a combination of two human monoclonal anti-HBs (HepeX-B) antibodies in patients with chronic hepatitis B. The antibody HBV-17 recognizes a conformational epitope, whereas antibody HBV-19 recognizes a linear epitope on the HBsAg. The kinetic profiles of the decline of serum HBV DNA and HBsAg revealed partial blocking of virion release from infected cells as a new antiviral mechanism, in addition to acceleration of HBV clearance from the circulation. We then replicated this approach in vitro, using cells secreting HBsAg, and compared the prediction of the mathematical modeling obtained from the in vivo kinetics. In vitro, HepeX-B treatment of HBsAg-producing cells showed cellular uptake of antibodies, resulting in intracellular accumulation of viral particles. Blocking of HBsAg secretion also continued after HepeX-B was removed from the cell culture supernatants. Conclusion: These results identify a novel antiviral mechanism of antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs) involving prolonged blocking of the HBV and HBsAg subviral particles release from infected cells. This may have implications in designing new therapies for patients with chronic HBV infection and may also be relevant in other viral infections.

How Dutch medical residents perceive their competency as manager in the revised postgraduate medical curriculum	POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							GRADUATE FOLLOW-UP; TEACHING PRACTICE MANAGEMENT; FAMILY-PRACTICE; PEDIATRIC RESIDENTS; PHYSICIANS; HEALTH	Introduction In 2005, competency based training was introduced into the curriculum of the postgraduate training of Dutch medical residents. The role as manager is one of the seven competencies and, compared to the other roles, it is presently thought to receive little attention during training. The goal of this study was to investigate medical residents' understanding of this competency and how they perceive their role as manager. Methods In October 2009, 506 residents from different specialties in four teaching hospitals were invited via email to participate in the study. A 29-item Likert scale questionnaire was designed to investigate residents perceived healthcare management skills and knowledge in four management areas. Results 177 of 506 residents (35%) responded to the survey. More than half of the residents (106/177, 60%) did not feel confident in their (contract) negotiating skills and 56% (98/175) stated that they lacked sufficient knowledge of how the Dutch healthcare system is financed and organised. The residents were most confident in their ability to handle feedback (151/177, 85%), medical information data registration (168/173, 97%), and how to allocate healthcare resources based on evidence based principles (143/173, 83%). Conclusion These results demonstrate that residents in the Netherlands perceive their knowledge and skills in certain essential medical management concepts to be inadequate. The results suggest that a course in medical management should be considered as a mandatory part of the curricula of residency training programmes.	[Berkenbosch, Lizanne; Brouns, Judith W.

However, the mechanism(s) involved in this identification has not been determined. This study was conducted to determine the information in CFPs that can be used to determine the sex of an individual. Methods: Prospective observational cross-sectional study of 112 eyes of 112 healthy volunteers. The following characteristics of CFPs were analyzed: the color of peripapillary area expressed by the mean values of red, green, and blue intensities, and the tessellation expressed by the tessellation fundus index (TFI). The optic disc ovality ratio, papillomacular angle, retinal artery trajectory, and retinal vessel angles were also quantified. Their differences between the sexes were assessed by Mann-Whitney U tests. Regularized binomial logistic regression was used to select the decisive factors. In addition, its discriminative performance was evaluated through the leave-one-out cross validation. Results: The mean age of 76 men and 36 women was 25.8 years. The regularized binomial logistic regression delivered the optimal model for sex selected variables of peripapillary temporal green and blue intensities, temporal TFI, supratemporal TFI, optic disc ovality ratio, artery trajectory, and supratemporal retinal artery angle. With this approach, the discrimination accuracy rate was 77.9%. Conclusions: Human-assessed characteristics of CFPs are useful in investigating the new theme proposed by AI, the sex of an individual. Translational Relevance: This is the first report to approach the thinking process of AI by humans and can be a new approach to medical AI research.

For this reason, the extension innovation method is introduced to implement doctors' thinking process in formulating treatment regimens in deep learning. First, an extension model is established for diseases according to the basic-element theory and the extension set theory based on the magnetic resonance image classification result under deep learning. Subsequently, extension analysis is made to analyze pathogenesis and corresponding treatment procedures; and multiple feasible treatment regimens are generated through extension transformation. At last, priority-degree evaluation is carried out to quantitatively assess the proposed treatment regimens and select a better regime from them. Here, ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is taken for example to validate the feasibility of applying the extension innovation method in treatment regime generation. Main contributions of this research are that both the extension model and the priority-degree evaluation method are introduced in treatment regime generation. In this way, after the deep learning method was used to automatically extract and classify medical image data features and determine the disease activity stage of ankylosing spondylitis, a formal and quantitative effective method can be provided for establishing the framework model of diseases and evaluating corresponding therapeutic regimens, then a foundation can be laid for arithmetic research on intelligent treatment regime generation via computer simulation of human thinking.

The humidity control properties of wood are known, but there have been few detailed analyses of its effects on living organisms. Therefore, we investigated the effects of cedar water-soluble components on human macrophages, which are essential for maintaining biological homeostasis and innate immunity. In this study, we prepared aqueous extracts from Cryptomeria japonica in Yoshino, Nara prefecture (called as Yoshino cedar). Yoshino cedar aqueous extracts stimulated macrophages toward the classically activated phenotype and inhibited the macrophage phenotype thought to mediate allergic responses. Next, we measured the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentration in the Yoshino cedar aqueous extract and found it was present at a high concentration. The major receptor of LPS is Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). To confirm whether LPS in Yoshino cedar aqueous extracts activate macrophages through the LPS/TLR4 pathway, we analyzed its effects on TLR4-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and wild-type (WT) MEF. TLR4-deficient MEF did not produce the proinflammatory cytokines seen in WT MEF. This result showed that LPS in the Yoshino cedar aqueous extracts activate macrophages via TLR4. This information will help us better understand the benefits of cedar for human health, including allergies.

Robust rules based in part on how citizens think about these moral dilemmas are necessary to deal with this conflict in a principled way, yet little is known about people's judgments and preferences around content moderation. We examined such moral dilemmas in a conjoint survey experiment where US respondents (N = 2, 564) indicated whether they would remove problematic social media posts on election denial, antivaccination, Holocaust denial, and climate change denial and whether they would take punitive action against the accounts. Respondents were shown key information about the user and their post as well as the consequences of the misinformation. The majority preferred quashing harmful misinformation over protecting free speech. Respondents were more reluctant to suspend accounts than to remove posts and more likely to do either if the harmful consequences of the misinformation were severe or if sharing it was a repeated offense. Features related to the account itself (the person behind the account, their partisanship, and number of followers) had little to no effect on respondents' decisions. Content moderation of harmful misinformation was a partisan issue: Across all four scenarios, Republicans were consistently less willing than Democrats or independents to remove posts or penalize the accounts that posted them. Our results can inform the design of transparent rules for content moderation of harmful misinformation.

Even correctional institutions are not safe': A qualitative study of campus secret cults/cultism among selected inmates in a custodial centre	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW CRIME AND JUSTICE			English	Article						Campus secret cults; cultism; Correctional institutions; Custodial centre; Inmates; Qualitative study	PRISON; NIGERIA; LIFE; BEHAVIOR; MENACE; GENDER; CRIME	The violent crime of campus cultism is widespread in Nigeria and hence has attracted increasing policy attention and scholarly works. However, much of the literature has focused on cultists (perpetrators of cultism) in the free world-cultism among prison inmates has been largely underexplored. Therefore, this study uniquely examined the importation and subsistence of cults/ cultism in Abakaliki custodial centre, Nigeria. Following a cross-sectional research design, snowballing and purposive sampling techniques were used to recruit 24 cultists, who participated in the in-depth oral interviews. Findings revealed that the campus secret cult tradition has crept into the correctional institution, where is perpetrated and perpetuated to attenuate the 'pains of imprisonment' and for survival (coping strategies) and adaptation (adjustment patterns). The problem has serious implications for prison security and reforms by frustrating treatment efforts. There is persistent desocialisation, manipulation and brainwashing of inmates through social contamination and learning of criminal thought patterns and hazing. Most of the activities of cultists are deeply shrouded in secrecy and regular use of argots (criminal jargons/slangs/coded languages) is widespread. The goal is to beat security and uphold group solidary, identity and proselytisation at all time and location, regardless of the associated risks and threats. Obtaining firsthand information in order to gain deeper insights into the modus operandi of cultists in the prison system promises a successful reformation of inmates and their reestablishment/reintegration upon release, which adds to increase custodial and public safety.

Autoimmune Disease Classification by Inverse Association with SNP Alleles	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; SPLICE-SITE MUTATION; 7 COMMON DISEASES; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; ANKYLOSING-SPONDYLITIS; DIABETES-MELLITUS; THYROID-DISEASE; CELIAC-DISEASE; BTNL2 GENE	With multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed across autoimmune diseases, there is a great opportunity to study the homogeneity of genetic architectures across autoimmune disease. Previous approaches have been limited in the scope of their analysis and have failed to properly incorporate the direction of allele-specific disease associations for SNPs. In this work, we refine the notion of a genetic variation profile for a given disease to capture strength of association with multiple SNPs in an allele-specific fashion. We apply this method to compare genetic variation profiles of six autoimmune diseases: multiple sclerosis (MS), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD), and type 1 diabetes (T1D), as well as five non-autoimmune diseases. We quantify pair-wise relationships between these diseases and find two broad clusters of autoimmune disease where SNPs that make an individual susceptible to one class of autoimmune disease also protect from diseases in the other autoimmune class. We find that RA and AS form one such class, and MS and ATD another. We identify specific SNPs and genes with opposite risk profiles for these two classes. We furthermore explore individual SNPs that play an important role in defining similarities and differences between disease pairs. We present a novel, systematic, cross-platform approach to identify allele-specific relationships between disease pairs based on genetic variation as well as the individual SNPs which drive the relationships. While recognizing similarities between diseases might lead to identifying novel treatment options, detecting differences between diseases previously thought to be similar may point to key novel disease-specific genes and pathways.

PAARTNERS study grp	Project among African-Americans to explore risks for schizophrenia (PAARTNERS): Recruitment and assessment methods	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						schizophrenia; genetics; endophenotype; neurocognitive; African-American	FAMILY-BASED ASSOCIATION; TRAIT LINKAGE ANALYSIS; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; GENOME-WIDE SCAN; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCI; GENETIC-LINKAGE; WORKING-MEMORY; BIPOLAR DISORDER; QUANTITATIVE TRAITS; ADMIXED POPULATIONS	The Project among Aftican-Americans to Explore Risks for Schizophrenia (PAARTNERS) is a multi-site, NIMH-funded study that seeks to identify genetic polymorphisms that confer susceptibility to schizophrenia among African-Americans by linkage mapping and targeted association analyses. Because deficits in certain dimensions of cognitive ability are thought to underlie liability to schizophrenia, the project also examines cognitive abilities in individuals affected by schizophrenia and their extended family members. This article describes PAARTNERS study design, ascertainment methods and preliminary sample characteristics. We aim to recruit a sample of 1260 African-American families, all of whom have at least one proband with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The data collection protocol includes a structured Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies, Family Interview for Genetic Studies, focused neurocognitive assessment, medical records review, and the collection of blood or buccal cells for genetic analyses. We have currently completed study procedures for 106 affected sib-pair, 457 case-parent trio and 23 multiplex families. A total of 289 probands have completed the best estimate final diagnosis process and 1153 probands and family members have been administered the computerized neuropsychological battery. This project lays the foundation for future analysis of cognitive and behavioral endophenotypes. This novel integration of diagnostic, neurocognitive and genetic data will also generate valuable information for future phenotypic and genetic studies of schizophrenia. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Today, two types of blood flow imaging tools are available: measurement-based flow visualization including 4D flow MRI (or 3D cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging), or echocardiography flow visualization software, and computer flow simulation modeling based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). MRI and echocardiography flow visualization provide measured blood flow but have limitations in temporal and spatial resolution, whereas CFD flow calculates the flow according to assumptions instead of flow measurement, and it has sufficiently fine resolution up to the computer memory limit, and it enables even virtual surgery when combined with computer graphics. Blood flow imaging provides profound insight into the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases, because it quantifies and visualizes mechanical stress on the vessel walls or heart ventricle. Wall shear stress (WSS) is a stress on the endothelial wall caused by the near wall blood flow, and it is thought to be a predictor of atherosclerosis progression in coronary or aortic diseases. Flow energy loss (EL) is the loss of blood flow energy caused by viscous friction of turbulent diseased flow, and it is expected to be a predictor of ventricular workload on various heart diseases including heart valve disease, cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart diseases. Blood flow imaging can provide useful information for developing predictive medicine in cardiovascular diseases, and may lead to breakthroughs in cardiovascular surgery, especially in the decision-making process.

PEERJ			English	Article						Emotional words; Valence; Origin of affect; Ambiguous task processing; Social cognition	AFFECT MISATTRIBUTION; SOCIAL COGNITION; INFORMATION; MORALITY; MODEL; CONCRETENESS; PERSPECTIVE; PERCEPTION; SUBSEQUENT; JUDGMENT	People tend to think that emotions influence the way they think in a spectacular way. We wanted to determine whether it is possible to prime the assessments of ambiguous stimuli by presenting emotion-laden words. We did not expect the differences in assessments that depend only on the emotional factors to be particularly large. Participants were presented with words differing in valence and origin of an affective state, but aligned for arousal, concreteness, length and frequency of use. Their first task was to remember a word. While keeping the word in mind, their second task was to guess by intuition whether the symbol was related to certain traits. Participants assessed objects represented by coding symbols on the scales of warmth or competence. We expected positive valence and automatic origin to promote higher ratings in terms of warmth and reflective origin to promote higher ratings in terms of competence. Positive valence appeared to boost assessments in terms of both warmth and competence, while the origin effect was found to be dissociative: automatic origin promoted intensity of warmth assessments and reflective origin intensity of competence assessments. The study showed an existing relation between emotional and social aspects of the mind, and therefore supports the conclusion that both domains may result from dual processes of a more general character.

A usability study	DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION			English	Article								Producing findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) data cannot be accomplished solely by data curators in all disciplines. In biology, we have shown that phenotypic data curation is not only costly, but it is burdened with inter-curator variation. We intend to propose a software platform that would enable all data producers, including authors of scientific publications, to produce ontologized data at the time of publication. Working toward this goal, we need to identify ontology construction methods that are preferred by end users. Here, we employ two usability studies to evaluate effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction with a set of four methods that allow an end user to add terms and their relations to an ontology. Thirty-three participants took part in a controlled experiment where they evaluated the four methods (Quick Form, Wizard, WebProtege and Wikidata) after watching demonstration videos and completing a hands-on task. Another think-aloud study was conducted with three professional botanists. The efficiency effectiveness and user confidence in the methods are clearly revealed through statistical and content analyses of participants' comments. Quick Form, Wizard and WebProtege offer distinct strengths that would benefit our author-driven FAIR data generation system. Features preferred by the participants will guide the design of future iterations.

Researchers have postulated that, in the context of creativity and information technology, not only are people are increasingly driven by the game-like structures of contemporary systems, services, organisational forms, incentive arrangements, and player-like behaviours rather than monetary incentives but also that the platforms that facilitative creative learning are becoming increasingly reminiscent of games. However, it is unclear how this gamification affects creativity vis-a-vis other forms of incentives. In this study, we investigated how gamification, money and punishment affect people's creativity. We randomly assigned 102 participants to four groups and given different incentives to complete an alternative-uses task. We measured their creativity according to the four classic elements: fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration. The results showed that creativity was significantly higher in the gamification and punishment conditions compared with the control and monetary reward conditions, but creativity was not significantly different between the monetary reward and control conditions. The findings of this study provide theoretical and practical insights to guide people designing effective talent development programmes and stimulating creativity in their employees.

J	Raghunathan, K; McKenna, L; Peddle, M				Raghunathan, Kalpana; McKenna, Lisa; Peddle, Monica			Use of academic electronic medical records in nurse education: A scoping review	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Review						Electronic medical record; Electronic documentation; Digital health; Nurse education; Nursing students; Simulation	HEALTH RECORD; CLINICAL PRACTICUM; STUDENT NURSES; DOCUMENTATION; SIMULATION; SYSTEM; INFORMATICS; ACCURACY; NEED	Background: Use of academic electronic medical records is internationally recognised as a means for preparing health professional students for the digital healthcare environment. Reported practice benefits include skills for electronic documentation, health informatics, point-of-care clinical decision support systems, as well as preparation for information technology-enabled clinical settings, while challenges include lack of access to simulation software, faculty-related barriers, limited finances and educational software costs. However, little is known about best practices related to its use within pre-licensure or entry-to-practice nursing curricula and impact on clinical practice outcomes. Objective: This review sought to explore how academic electronic medical records are used in entry-to-practice nursing curricula. Design: A scoping review guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute three-step search strategy, exploring existing publications and grey literature. Inclusion criteria: Quantitative and qualitative studies related to use of academic electronic medical records in pre-licensure nurse education. Information sources: A range of databases were searched including CINAHL, Medline, Proquest Central, ERIC, ScienceDirect, PubMed, IOS Press, as well as grey literature, reference lists and handsearching. Review methods: The search yielded 580 articles, from which inductive thematic analysis of 34 included studies was conducted. Results: Included articles were nine qualitative, 21 quantitative and five mixed methods studies. Most originated from the USA. Academic electronic medical records are mainly used to teach documentation, safe use of health technology, and for clinical preparation. Most are used for fundamental or junior levels courses, with problembased learning and simulation embedded. Institution?s technology resources and faculty capability are essential to implementation. Conclusions: There is a need for more research that examines optimal timing and duration of use of academic electronic medical records in curricula, and their impact on critical thinking and clinical performance. Finally, there is a need to explore greater academic-clinical partnerships in the education process.

However, none of these programs have been carefully evaluated. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate one such program. Methods:: We randomly assigned 599 young drivers who had received a traffic citation to an ADTP, or a control condition involving traditional classroom traffic safety education. Results:: Time-to-event (survival) analyses of participants' subsequent crash experience over the course of 550 days revealed no meaningful difference in the number of days to the first crash for those who participated in the experimental or control programs, or those who left the study. Conclusions:: The advanced driver training program evaluated in this study produced more crash reduction benefits for participants than traditional classroom-based programs. A strength of the study was the relatively large sample size and the random assignment of participants to conditions, which ruled out self-selection bias. However, this group, recruited as a result of traffic violation, may have already developed a higher risk driving demeanor than was the case in the broader population of young drivers. Additional research with other ADTPs and with a population of drivers who are earlier in their driving careers, using a similarly strong experimental design, is urgently needed to inform traffic safety practitioners and parents about the potential value of such hands-on programs.

Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange Kinetics Demonstrate Long Range Allosteric Effects of Thumb Site 2 Inhibitors of Hepatitis C Viral RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							HIV-1 REVERSE-TRANSCRIPTASE; VIRUS NS5B POLYMERASE; NONNUCLEOSIDE INHIBITORS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; HYDROGEN-EXCHANGE; MECHANISM; BINDING; INITIATION; DYNAMICS; PROTEIN	New nonnucleoside analogs are being developed as part of a multi-drug regimen to treat hepatitis C viral infections. Particularly promising are inhibitors that bind to the surface of the thumb domain of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B). Numerous crystal structures have been solved showing small molecule non-nucleoside inhibitors bound to the hepatitis C viral polymerase, but these structures alone do not define the mechanism of inhibition. Our prior kinetic analysis showed that nonnucleoside inhibitors binding to thumb site-2 (NNI2) do not block initiation or elongation of RNA synthesis; rather, they block the transition from the initiation to elongation, which is thought to proceed with significant structural rearrangement of the enzyme-RNA complex. Here we have mapped the effect of three NNI2 inhibitors on the conformational dynamics of the enzyme using hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics. All three inhibitors rigidify an extensive allosteric network extending > 40 angstrom from the binding site, thus providing a structural rationale for the observed disruption of the transition from distributive initiation to processive elongation. The two more potent inhibitors also suppress slow cooperative unfolding in the fingers extension-thumb interface and primer grip, which may contribute their stronger inhibition. These results establish that NNI2 inhibitors act through long range allosteric effects, reveal important conformational changes underlying normal polymerase function, and point the way to the design of more effective allosteric inhibitors that exploit this new information.

The questionnaire was designed with 18 items in five different languages: English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. Data were collected on nationality, age, sex, country of residence, university attended, semester, expected year of graduation and expectations about future career. More than 3000 participants (n = 3851, 2863 females 74.34% and 988 males 25.66% with a sex ratio of 0.35) participated in the survey. Almost one-third (31.29%) of the participants plan to start their own practice at least three years after vocational training, a quarter (25.76%) after three, and only 12.59% after one year. A positive influence of the family in the decision to start a practice was observed in 50.07% of the sample with a statistically significant difference regarding sex (p < 0.01). Almost one-third of the participants did not wish to work in an institution run by private equity or insurance companies, while 21.79% would work in that environment (p < 0.01). European dental students desire mainly to become self-employed and start their own practice. New professional practices also offer them options for their future career that they have not yet decided on or thought about.

Australian public health COVID-19 messaging is missing its mark in some vulnerable communities and people who reject COVID-19 safety advice	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article								Background There are groups in our community who may be more vulnerable to contracting, transmitting, or experiencing negative health impacts of COVID-19 than the general community. They may also have greater difficulty accessing, accepting, and acting upon COVID-19 public health information. Our aim was to understand if vulnerable communities and those who express "COVID-risk" behavioural intentions seek and respond differently to COVID-19 public health information. Methods This observational, cross-sectional study recruited adults aged over 18 years from the Australian general community and six community groups (people with disabilities and their caregivers, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, aged care workers, street-based sex workers, refugees and asylum seekers, and the deaf and hard of hearing). We investigated attitudes and beliefs about COVID-19 public health messages. We identified factors associated with the respondent's perception of the ease of finding information and understanding it, and its relevance to them. We also examined latent classes that were developed based on attitudes to public health measures and vulnerable group categories, along with demographic variables. Results We received 1444 responses (n = 1121 general community; n >= 50 for each vulnerable group). The vulnerable groups examined found COVID-19 public health messages as easy, if not easier, to find and understand than the general community. Four latent classes were identified: COVID-safe mask wearers (10% of sample), COVID-safe test takers (56%), COVID-risk isolators (19%) and COVID-risk visitors (15%). The COVID-risk classes (34% of sample) were less likely to consider COVID-19 information easy to find, understandable, and relevant. Conclusions Additional public health messaging strategies may be needed for targeting people with "COVID-risk" beliefs and attitudes who appear across the community (general and vulnerable groups) rather than just targeting specific cultural or other groupings that we think may be vulnerable. COVID-risk classes identified through this study were not defined by demographic characteristics or cultural groupings, but were spread across vulnerable communities and the general community. Different approaches for tailoring and delivery of specific public health information for these groups are needed.

Factors affecting health care workers' adoption of a website with infection control guidelines	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Practice guideline; Communicable diseases; Qualitative evaluation; Innovation diffusion	CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINES; WORLD-WIDE-WEB; UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS; PATIENT; PROTOCOLS; QUALITY; IMPLEMENTATION; INTERVENTIONS; PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION	Goal: To identify factors that could affect health care workers' (HCWs) adoption of a website for communicating infection control guidelines. Methods: In total, 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted with HCWs in 5 different occupational groups and 4 different hospitals in the Netherlands and Germany. A website communicating guidelines for the prevention and control of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus served as a casus. The HCWs, the majority of whom had prior experience with the website, were asked to give their opinions about factors that hinder or facilitate adoption of the website in practice. The interviews were based on the PRECEDE (Predisposing, Reinforcing, and Enabling Causes in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation) model complemented by quality criteria for health-related websites. This model encompasses different categories of factors relevant to technology adoption in health care. Results: A total of 361 interview statements were relevant to the four main categories of the PRECEDE model, yielding the following observations: (1) Technological factors (72 statements): The usability, design, and relevance of the website were positively valued. The website enabled HCWs to access contextually relevant information quickly. The website's credibility was evaluated rather negatively, as respondents perceived that the website's guidelines were not in concurrence with the best available evidence and it was not clear to HCWs who created the website. (2) Individual factors (85 statements): Respondents, particular infection control professionals, showed individual resistance to the website because they preferred to use their personal knowledge and experience (and communication with colleagues) over online sources. (3) Work-related factors (53 statements): Respondents perceived high work pressure during working hours as an impediment to consulting the website. In contrast, respondents thought the website might lower work pressure for infection control professionals, as they will receive fewer questions from HCWs. (4) Organizational factors (131 statements): Interpersonal (face-to-face) communication between HCWs from different occupational groups in both a formal (training) and informal (feedback) manner was seen as the most stimulating factor behind website use. The respondents identified infection control nurses as the most important opinion leaders. Conclusion: Factors from multiple categories determine HCWs' adoption of web-based guidelines, but the organization appeared to be a paramount reinforcer of initiation and maintenance of technology adoption among HCWs. In order eliminate resistance and create ownership among HCWs toward the website, leading to a willingness to integrate the website into routine care, it is essential to more actively involve HCWs in the early phases of the design process.

Medicinal plants are a part of everyday life. Medicinal plants have many effects on the lives of individuals diagnosed with mental illness. What the paper adds to existing knowledge? Since there is no qualitative study in which individuals diagnosed with mental illness provided a detailed explanation of their views about the use of medicinal plants, this study will fill a gap in the literature and guide mental health nurses. This study provides information for mental health nurses about how individuals diagnosed with mental illness evaluate medicinal plants, what it means to them and the effects of medicinal plants. It provides ideas about the use of medicinal plants as a tool to protect and improve mental health. In addition, since the majority of the studies on mental illnesses and medicinal plants are quantitative studies, it was thought that this study was different from the seminal studies in the literature and could offer new ideas for future studies. What are the implications for practice? The results of this study show mental health nurses that the positive aspects of medicinal plants can be used to maintain and improve the mental health of individuals diagnosed with mental illness. Mental health nurses should evaluate the treatment and maintenance process in detail, considering that medicinal plants may interact with drug treatment or the risks of using medicinal plants in terms of adverse effects. Moreover, mental health nurses should fight against the negative aspects of medicinal plants. Mental health nurses and individuals diagnosed with mental illness should be made aware of the use of medicinal plants. Aim There was no qualitative study found in which individuals diagnosed with mental illness explained their views in detail about the use of medicinal plants. It is therefore thought that this study will fill this gap in the literature and guide mental health nurses in the field. The research was carried out to determine the use of medicinal plants by individuals diagnosed with mental illness. Method This research was a qualitative study conducted using the case study design. Ten individuals diagnosed with mental illness for at least 10 years, determined by the purposeful sampling method were interviewed. The data were collected between March and April 2022 with information form and semi-structured interview form and analysed with the content analysis method. Findings Four of the participants had depression, four had anxiety and two had mood disorders. Themes were determined to be a source of healing (ointment for the soul, body tonic and organic and nature's miracles) and cultural accumulation (faith and inheritance, counselling helpline). Conclusion Participants described medicinal plants as a source of healing, stating that medicinal plants are good for bodily and mental health and provide purification. Individuals stated that the information about medicinal plants represents cultural accumulation as an inheritance, they applied them as a counselling helpline in case of illness. Implications for Practice The positive effects of medicinal plant use can be supported by mental health nurses. Considering that medicinal plants may interact with the drug treatment, the use of medicinal plants should be evaluated in detail by mental health nurses.

Limitations and Misinterpretations of E-Values for Sensitivity Analyses of Observational Studies	ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article								The E-value was recently introduced on the basis of earlier work as "the minimum strength of association... that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the treatment and the outcome to fully explain away a specific treatment-outcome association, conditional on the measured covariates." E-values have been proposed for wide application in observational studies evaluating causality. However, they have limitations and are prone to misinterpretation. E-values have a monotonic, almost linear relationship with effect estimates and thus offer no additional information beyond what effect estimates can convey. Whereas effect estimates are based on real data, E-values may make unrealistic assumptions. No general rule can exist about what is a "small enough" E-value, and users of the biomedical literature are not familiar with how to interpret a range of E-values. Problems arise for any measure dependent on effect estimates and their CIs-for example, bias due to selective re-porting and dependence on choice of exposure contrast and level of confidence. The automation of E-values may give an excuse not to think seriously about confounding. Moreover, biases other than confounding may still undermine results. Instead of misused or misinterpreted E-values, the authors recommend judicious use of existing methods for sensitivity analyses with careful assumptions; systematic assessments of whether and how known confounders have been handled, along with consideration of their prevalence and magnitude; thorough discussion of the potential for unknown confounders considering the study design and field of application; and explicit caution in making causal claims from observational studies.

This study attempts to improve the understanding of the negative impacts of mobile channels on the quality of online reviews. Design/methodology/approach The authors develop a series of hypotheses to investigate the text-posting behaviors with mobile device usage. To examine the authors' hypotheses, the authors collect online reviews posted in London hotels on Booking.com. The authors first use a logistic regression model to examine the relationship between the usage of mobile devices and text-posting behavior. Then, the authors explored the characteristics of textual content in mobile reviews compared to reviews written via traditional devices. Findings The authors' finding shows that the use of mobile devices negatively influences text-posting behavior. Compared to traditional devices, consumers are less likely to post texts in their reviews with mobile devices. Although consumers decide to post text comments in consumers' reviews, the quality of textual content is relatively low - short in length, with limited analytical thinking and less authenticity. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, no study has attempted to explore text generation in review-posting behaviors in the context of mobile channels. Also, the authors' findings show the negative effects of using mobile channels on the value of generated information, which is counterintuitive to previous research.

This paper argues for the use of risk governance approaches to manage nanotechnology risks and sustainability, and considers the links between these concepts. Further, seven risk assessment and management criteria relevant to risk governance are defined: (a) life cycle thinking, (b) triple bottom line, (c) inclusion of stakeholders, (d) risk management, (e) benefitrisk assessment, (f) consideration of uncertainty, and (g) adaptive response. These criteria are used to compare five well-developed nanotechnology frameworks: International Risk Governance Council framework, Comprehensive Environmental Assessment, Streaming Life Cycle Risk Assessment, Certifiable Nanospecific Risk Management and Monitoring System and LICARA NanoSCAN. A Sustainable Nanotechnology Decision Support System (SUNDS) is proposed to better address current nanotechnology risk assessment and management needs, and makes. Stakeholder needs were solicited for further SUNDS enhancement through a stakeholder workshop that included representatives from regulatory, industry and insurance sectors. Workshop participants expressed the need for the wider adoption of sustainability assessment methods and tools for designing greener nanomaterials.

The structures of the compounds were determined by methods such as FT-IR, H-1, C-13 NMR, UV-vis, Photoluminescence spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. By using methods such as UV-vis, Photoluminescence spectroscopy, and viscosity tests, information were collected about the binding types, binding mode, and binding energies of the compounds with DNA. In addition, the binding interactions of the compounds with DNA were investigated using the molecular docking technique. Using this information, calibration equations, correlation coefficients (r(2)), and DNA binding constants (K-b) were calculated for their compounds. The binding constants (K-b) calculated for substances A, B, and C were found to be 3.0 x 10(4), 7.0 x 10(4), and 3.0 x 10(4) M-1, respectively. UV-vis, EB competitive binding, and viscosity tests showed that the compounds tended to bind to the DNA structure via the groove binding mode. At the end of molecular docking studies, it was determined that compound B showed the best DNA binding activity in in vitro studies. Compared with the studies in the literature, it is thought that the synthesized compounds can take place in cancer drug research as DNA binding agents.

The current study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the cognitive processes for belief attribution in moral judgment. Participants read vignettes in a 2 x 2 x 2 design: protagonists produced either a negative or neutral outcome, based on the belief that they were causing the negative outcome or the neutral outcome; presentation of belief information either preceded or followed outcome information. In each case, participants judged the moral permissibility of the action. The results indicate that while the medial prefrontal cortex is recruited for processing belief valence, the temporo-parietal junction and precuneus are recruited for processing beliefs in moral judgment via two distinct component processes: (1) encoding beliefs and (2) integrating beliefs with other relevant features of the action (e. g., the outcome) for moral judgment.

J	Gu, JD; Xie, YM; Schaefer, HF				Gu, JD; Xie, YM; Schaefer, HF			Glycosidic bond cleavage of pyrimidine nucleosides by low-energy electrons: A theoretical rationale	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							UNALTERED BASE RELEASE; RADICAL-ANIONS; GAS-PHASE; DNA; AFFINITIES; CYTOSINE; DISSOCIATION; DENSITY; THYMINE; DAMAGE	DNA damage by attachment of low-energy secondary electrons is a very interesting and important mechanism. Electron capture and subsequent base release are thought to be the elementary steps of this mechanism. The process of the N1-glycosidic bond breaking of anion radicals of pyrimidine nucleosides, specifically the 2'-deoxyribothymidine (dT) and 2'-deoxyribocytidine (dC) anions, has been investigated theoretically at the B3LYP/DZP++ level of theory. The release of nucleobases by the attachment of low-energy electrons depends on the formation of a stable anion radical of the nucleoside. The lower bond-breaking activation energy and the higher vertical electron detachment energy for dT enables the heterolytic cleavage of the N1-glycosidic bond. However, with the higher bond-breaking activation energy and the lower vertical electron detachment energy for dC, the release of cytosine might be impractical when the incident electrons have high kinetic energy. Furthermore, the release of cytosine would have a quantum yield much lower than that of dT when the incident electrons have lower kinetic energy. This study also demonstrates the importance of the proton at O5' of 2'-deoxyribose in the base release process. Extending this investigation from dT to dC advances the insight into the mechanism of the N1-glycosidic bond-breaking process. The information from this extensive investigation should be valuable for further experimental studies of cytosine release in irradiated DNA.

A quantitative assessment of hormetic responses of plants to ozone	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Review						Air pollution; Dose-response; Environmental change; Hormesis; Non-linear; Ozone; Stress biology; U-shaped curve	OPEN-TOP CHAMBER; SURFACE OZONE; DOSE RESPONSES; HORMESIS DATABASE; INDUCE HORMESIS; AMBIENT OZONE; CROP YIELD; IMPACT; GROWTH; CULTIVARS	Evaluations of ozone effects on vegetation across the globe over the last seven decades have mostly incorporated exposure levels that were multi-fold the preindustrial concentrations. As such, global risk assessments and derivation of critical levels for protecting plants and food supplies were based on extrapolation from high to low exposure levels. These were developed in an era when it was thought that stress biology is framed around a linear dose-response. However, it has recently emerged that stress biology commonly displays non-linear, hormetic processes. The current biological understanding highlights that the strategy of extrapolating from high to low exposure levels may lead to biased estimates. Here, we analyzed a diverse sample of published empirical data of approximately 500 stimulatory, hormetic-like dose-responses induced by ozone in plants. The median value of the maximum stimulatory responses induced by elevated ozone was 124%, and commonly < 150%, of the background response (control), independently of species and response variable. The maximum stimulatory response to ozone was similar among types of response variables and major plant species. It was also similar among clades, between herbaceous and woody plants, between deciduous and evergreen trees, and between annual and perennial herbaceous plants. There were modest differences in the stimulatory response between genera and between families which may reflect different experimental designs and conditions among studies. The responses varied significantly upon type of exposure system, with open-top chambers (OTCs) underestimating the maximum stimulatory response compared to free-air ozone-concentration enrichment (FACE) systems. These findings suggest that plants show a generalized hormetic stimulation by ozone which is constrained within certain limits of biological plasticity, being highly generalizable, evolutionarily based, and maintained over ecological scales. They further highlight that non-linear responses should be taken into account when assessing the ozone effects on plants.

However, clinical trials to test this theory require the recruitment and retention of adults with new-onset T1D, which can be challenging. We sought to determine the overall experiences of newly diagnosed adults with T1D in an exercise study, to understand issues that influence the retention of trial participants in such studies. Design Qualitative methodology using individual face-to-face (n=6) and telephone interviews (n=14). Interview transcripts were thematically analysed using the framework method. Setting The study took place at five participating UK hospitals. Participants Twenty participants, aged 19-55 years, in the Exercise for Type 1 Diabetes study were interviewed to explore their study experiences and identify motivators and deterrents towards the study. Participants in control and intervention arms were interviewed, as were people with T1D who had completed (n=16) and withdrawn (n=4). Results Participants revealed barriers and facilitators to retention; the majority were generalisable to clinical trials of people with newly diagnosed T1D. Coming to terms with a diagnosis of T1D, lack of time, work pressures, level of health professional support, volume, clarity and consistency of information and feedback and a desire for knowledge about their condition were all cited as influencing factors to trial retention. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study to examine the experience of being involved in an exercise trial by people with T1D. Findings suggest appointments could be shorter, available outside of working hours and planned longer in advance; study information should be clear, consistent and in electronic and paper formats; questionnaires need minimising; healthcare support and feedback needs providing regularly; thought is required around how to support non-exercising arm participants. These considerations may improve participant retention rates in new-onset T1D studies.

While less frequently reported, specific cases exist in which two overlapping ORFs are in frame and share the stop codon. Here, we studied the occurrence of this genetic arrangement in endolysins, the phage enzymes that cut the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan to release the virion progeny. After screening over 3,000 endolysin sequences of phages infecting Gram-positive bacteria, we found evidence that this coding strategy is frequent in endolysin genes. Our bioinformatics predictions were experimentally validated by demonstrating that two polypeptides are indeed produced from these genes. Additionally, we show that in some cases the two polypeptides need to interact and multimerize to generate the active endolysin. By studying in detail one selected example, we uncovered a heteromeric endolysin with a 1:5 subunit stoichiometry that has never been described before. Hence, we conclude that the occurrence of endolysin genes encoding two polypeptide isoforms by in-frame overlapping ORFs, as well as their organization as enzymatic complexes, appears more common than previously thought, therefore challenging the established view of endolysins being mostly formed by single, monomeric polypeptide chains. IMPORTANCE Bacteriophages use endolysins to cleave the host bacteria cell wall, a crucial event underlying cell lysis for virion progeny release. These bacteriolytic enzymes are generally thought to work as single, monomeric polypeptides, but a few examples have been described in which a single gene produces two endolysin isoforms. These are encoded by two in-frame overlapping ORFs, with a shorter ORF being defined by an internal translation start site. This work shows evidence that this endolysin coding strategy is frequent in phages infecting Gram-positive bacteria, and not just an eccentricity of a few phages. In one example studied in detail, we show that the two isoforms are inactive until they assemble to generate a multimeric active endolysin, with a 1:5 subunit stoichiometry never described before. This study challenges the established view of endolysins, with possible implications in their current exploration and design as alternative antibacterials.

J	Pan, HA; Wu, MH; Hsu, CC; Yao, BL; Huang, KE				Pan, HA; Wu, MH; Hsu, CC; Yao, BL; Huang, KE			The perception of menopause among women in Taiwan	MATURITAS			English	Article						menopause; climacteric; Taiwan	HONG-KONG	Objectives: Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has become a popular topic and the subject of many newspaper and magazine health articles in the last 5 years in Taiwan, so a great deal of knowledge about the menopause has been introduced to Taiwanese women. With this massive change, we wanted to know the current perception of the menopause among women in Taiwan and also evaluate the prevalence of various acute menopausal symptoms and women's attitudes toward receiving hormone replacement therapy. Methods: We designed a cross-sectional study, using structured questionnaires, targeting women who attended the health information seminar on the menopause and HRT, held in an urban area in Taiwan. The audience was asked to fill out the questionnaire before the seminar began. More than 2000 questionnaires were collected, but only 386 women completed all items of the questionnaire and were included in this study. Among them, 161 women were postmenopausal and their answers to questions regarding acute menopausal symptoms were collected for statistical analysis. The other 225 women were nonmenopausal and their perception of menopausal symptoms was also collected for analysis. Qualitative data, in the form of transcripts, were interpreted using text-based content analysis. Results: Among these women, 375/386 (97%) had previously heard of the menopause, but only 207/386 (53%) knew the definition of the term. The most commonly indicated source of knowledge on the menopause was reading material, such as newspapers and magazines 283/386 (43%); less common sources of information were friends 141/386 (22%), medical personnel 114/386 (18%) and family members 49/386 (8%). Among these women, 276 (71%) thought they should receive therapy. The most common acute menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women and perception of menopausal symptoms in non-menopausal women, respectively, were insomnia 68/161 (42%); 111/225 (49%), hot flushes 61/161 (38%); 115/225 (51%), heart palpitation 55/161 (34%); 103/225 (46%), an irritable temper 54/161 (34%); 138/225 (61%), dyspareunia 52/161 (32%); 100/225 (44%), headaches or dizziness 45/161 (28%); 74/225 (33%), a lack of energy 42/161 (26%); 73/225 (32%), depression 32/161 (20%); 114/225 (51%), night sweating 29/161 (18%); 61/225 (27%), and loss of bladder control 26/161 (16%); 37/225 (16%). Conclusions: According to this study, Taiwanese women have a much higher percentage of awareness of the menopause than other Asian women, as reported previously and a greater willingness to receive treatment. We also found that most of their knowledge of the menopause was obtained from reading material (43%) or friends (22%). Furthermore, the percentage of recognition of menopausal symptoms, especially of vasomotor symptoms, is lower than that of Western women and higher than that of women in Hong Kong and Southern China.

AMELIORATIVE EFFECT OF TRADITIONAL JAPANESE MEDICINE <i>YOKUKANSAN</i> ON AGE-RELATED IMPAIRMENTS OF WORKING MEMORY AND REVERSAL LEARNING IN RATS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						yokukansan; aging; working memory; reversal learning; prefrontal cortical structure; rat	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; YI-GAN-SAN; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEYS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; DOPAMINERGIC DYSFUNCTION; PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; SPATIAL MEMORY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE	Aging is thought to impair prefrontal cortical (PFC) structure-sensitive cognitive functions and flexibility, such as working memory and reversal learning. A traditional Japanese medicine, yokukansan (YKS), is frequently used to treat age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease in Japan, but its pharmacological properties have not been elucidated. The present study was designed to examine whether YKS improves age-related cognitive deficits using aged rats. YKS was administered to 21-month-old rats for 3 months. The ability to learn initially a reward rule for a T-maze discrimination task (initial learning) was examined in young control (4-month-old), aged control (24-month-old) and YKS-treated aged (24-month-old) rats. Subsequently, working memory and reversal learning were examined in delayed alternation and reversal discrimination T-maze tasks, respectively. Locomotor activity was also measured in new environments. Although performance accuracy in the initial learning procedure did not differ among any experimental groups, accuracy in the delayed alternation task was significantly decreased in aged rats compared to young rats. Aged rats also showed significant decreases in accuracy in the reversal discrimination task. YKS treatment significantly ameliorated the age-related decreases in accuracy in the delayed alternation and reversal discrimination tasks. The ameliorative effects of YKS on impaired delayed alternation performance were reduced by intracranial infusions of a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, into the prelimbic cortical region of the PFC, and the YKS effects on impaired reversal learning were done by the infusions into the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Locomotor activity did not change in any experimental group. Thus, YKS ameliorated age-related impairments of working memory and reversal learning, which might be mediated by a dopaminergic mechanism in the PFC structure. These investigations provide information important for the treatment of brain dysfunctions in the elderly people. (C) 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Improving decision making in larynx cancer by developing a decision aid: A mixed methods approach	LARYNGOSCOPE			English	Article						Patient decision aid; counseling; health communication; larynx cancer; chemoradiotherapy; radiotherapy; laryngectomy	PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES; TOTAL LARYNGECTOMY; NECK-CANCER; SURVIVAL; PRESERVATION; QUALITY; INFORMATION; VALIDATION; RADIATION; TRENDS	Objective Patients diagnosed with advanced larynx cancer face a decisional process in which they can choose between radiotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, or a total laryngectomy with adjuvant radiotherapy. Clinicians do not always agree on the best clinical treatment, making the decisional process for patients a complex problem. Methods Guided by the International Patient Decision Aid (PDA) Standards, we followed three developmental phases for which we held semi-structured in-depth interviews with patients and physicians, thinking-out-loud sessions, and a study-specific questionnaire. Audio-recorded interviews were verbatim transcribed, thematically coded, and analyzed. Phase 1 consisted of an evaluation of the decisional needs and the regular counseling process; phase 2 tested the comprehensibility and usability of the PDA; and phase 3 beta tested the feasibility of the PDA. Results Patients and doctors agreed on the need for development of a PDA. Major revisions were conducted after phase 1 to improve the readability and replace the majority of text with video animations. Patients and physicians considered the PDA to be a major improvement to the current counseling process. Conclusion This study describes the development of a comprehensible and easy-to-use online patient decision aid for advanced larynx cancer, which was found satisfactory by patients and physicians (available on ).

Sagebrush treatments influence annual population change for greater sage-grouse	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						Centrocercus urophasianus; herbicide application; mechanical treatment; population change; prescribed burning; wildfire	WYOMING BIG SAGEBRUSH; GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATIONS; AKAIKES INFORMATION CRITERION; ENERGY DEVELOPMENT; HABITAT MANAGEMENT; BROMUS-TECTORUM; FIRE; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; SURVIVAL	Vegetation management practices have been applied worldwide to enhance habitats for a variety of wildlife species. Big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp.) communities, iconic to western North America, have been treated to restore herbaceous understories through chemical, mechanical, and prescribed burning practices thought to improve habitat conditions for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and other species. Although the response of structural attributes of sagebrush communities to treatments is well understood, there is a need to identify how treatments influence wildlife population dynamics. We investigated the influence of vegetation treatments occurring in Wyoming, United States, from 1994 to 2012 on annual sage-grouse population change using yearly male sage-grouse lek counts. We investigated this response across 1, 3, 5, and 10-year post-treatment lags to evaluate how the amount of treated sagebrush communities and time since treatment influenced population change, while accounting for climate, wildfire, and anthropogenic factors. With the exception of chemical treatments exhibiting a positive association with sage-grouse population change 11years after implementation, population response to treatments was either neutral or negative for at least 11years following treatments. Our work supports a growing body of research advocating against treating big sagebrush habitats for sage-grouse, particularly in Wyoming big sagebrush (A. t. wyomingensis). Loss and fragmentation of sagebrush habitats has been identified as a significant threat for remaining sage-grouse populations. Because sagebrush may take decades to recover following treatments, we recommend practitioners use caution when designing projects to alter remaining habitats, especially when focused on habitat requirements for one life stage and a single species.

A realist evaluation protocol	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							INTERVENTIONS; COALITIONS; PROGRAM	Introduction: The proposed research is part of ongoing operations research within World Vision's Access: Infant and Maternal Health Programme. This study aims to identify key context features and underlying mechanisms through which community health committees build community capacity within the field of maternal and child health. This may help to improve programme implementation by providing contextually informed and explanatory findings for how community health committees work, what works best and for whom do they work for best for. Though frequently used within health programmes, little research is carried out on such committees' contribution to capacity building-a frequent goal or proposed outcome of these groups. Methods and analysis: The scarce information that does exist often fails to explain 'how, why, and for whom' these committees work best. Since such groups typically operate within or as components of complex health interventions, they require a systems thinking approach and design, and thus so too does their evaluation. Using a mixed methods realist evaluation with intraprogramme case studies, this protocol details a proposed study on community health committees in rural Tanzania and Uganda to better understand underlying mechanisms through which these groups work (or do not) to build community capacity for maternal and child health. This research protocol follows the realist evaluation methodology of eliciting initial programme theories, to inform the field study design, which are detailed within. Thus far, the methodology of a realist evaluation has been well suited to the study of community health committees within these contexts. Implications for its use within these contexts are discussed within. Ethics and dissemination: Institutional Review Boards and the appropriate research clearance bodies within Ireland, Uganda and Tanzania have approved this study. Planned dissemination activities include via academic and programme channels, as well as feedback to the communities in which this work occurs.

Why it hurts: with freedom comes the biological need for pain	ANIMAL COGNITION			English	Article						action selection; invertebrate; emotion; autonomy; free will; nociception	SHOCK AVOIDANCE; TRADE-OFFS; BEHAVIOR; CONSCIOUSNESS; EXPERIENCE; EVOLUTION; EMOTION; MODEL; NEUROSCIENCE; INFORMATION	We argue that pain is not needed to protect the body from damage unless the organism is able to make free choices in action selection. Then pain (including its affective and evaluative aspects) provides a necessary prioritising motivation to select actions expected to avoid it, whilst leaving the possibility of alternative actions to serve potentially higher priorities. Thus, on adaptive grounds, only organisms having free choice over action selection should experience pain. Free choice implies actions must be selected following appraisal of their effects, requiring a predictive model generating estimates of action outcomes. These features give organisms anticipatory behavioural autonomy (ABA), for which we propose a plausible system using an internal predictive model, integrated into a system able to produce the qualitative and affective aspects of pain. Our hypothesis can be tested using behavioural experiments designed to elicit trade-off responses to novel experiences for which algorithmic (automaton) responses might be inappropriate. We discuss the empirical evidence for our hypothesis among taxonomic groups, showing how testing for ABA guides thinking on which groups might experience pain. It is likely that all vertebrates do and plausible that some invertebrates do (decapods, cephalopods and at least some insects).

One in four toddlers are not achieving the recommended intake for their healthy development. This study uses quantitative and qualitative methods to explore parents' perceptions, awareness and behaviours around vitamin D intake, and the acceptability of and factors affecting purchasing of food and drink fortified with Vitamin D in children aged 0-2 years old. Methods One hundred and ninety-four parents completed an online questionnaire, advertised to parents with one child aged up to 2 years on popular social media websites. The majority of participants were mothers, White-British ethnic background, aged 25-44 years. Participants provided an email address if they wanted to be contacted about the focus groups. Recruitment posters advertising the focus groups were placed in community centres. Eighteen participated in 5 focus groups (13 parents), and 5 individual interviews. A thematic analysis methodology was applied. Results Fifty-seven percent (n = 110) of parents reported receiving information about vitamin D during pregnancy and 52% (n = 100) after the birth of their child. Parents reported a low level of satisfaction with vitamin D information: many thought it was limited and recommendations on supplements were unclear. Parents wanted more information about vitamin D requirements for their child (80%, n = 153 out of 192 respondents, 2 non-response), about vitamin D and breastfeeding (56%, n = 108) and vitamin D and pregnancy (49%, n = 94). The recommendations were for simpler, easier to read, with specific and clearer guidelines; delivered regularly during routine appointments, at timely stages throughout pregnancy and after the birth. 23% (n = 45, out of 194 respondents) of parents did not know why vitamin D is important for health. Only 26% (n = 49, out of 192 respondents) of parents reported giving their youngest child a vitamin D supplement on most days of the week. The majority of parents (interview/focus group) wanted more information about foods/drinks fortified with vitamin D. Conclusion Parents were generally not aware of the importance of vitamin D, dietary requirements including supplementation and the availability of vitamin D fortified foods. Major improvements are required for the effective promotion of vitamin D information to parents.

The case of the size-weight illusion	PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH-PSYCHOLOGISCHE FORSCHUNG			English	Article							PERCEPTION; THOUGHT; SPEECH	Co-speech gestures have been proposed to strengthen sensorimotor knowledge related to objects' weight and manipulability. This pre-registered study () was designed to explore how gestures affect memory for sensorimotor information through the application of the visual-haptic size-weight illusion (i.e., objects weigh the same, but are experienced as different in weight). With this paradigm, a discrepancy can be induced between participants' conscious illusory perception of objects' weight and their implicit sensorimotor knowledge (i.e., veridical motor coordination). Depending on whether gestures reflect and strengthen either of these types of knowledge, gestures may respectively decrease or increase the magnitude of the size-weight illusion. Participants (N = 159) practiced a problem-solving task with small and large objects that were designed to induce a size-weight illusion, and then explained the task with or without co-speech gesture or completed a control task. Afterwards, participants judged the heaviness of objects from memory and then while holding them. Confirmatory analyses revealed an inverted size-weight illusion based on heaviness judgments from memory and we found gesturing did not affect judgments. However, exploratory analyses showed reliable correlations between participants' heaviness judgments from memory and (a) the number of gestures produced that simulated actions, and (b) the kinematics of the lifting phases of those gestures. These findings suggest that gestures emerge as sensorimotor imaginings that are governed by the agent's conscious renderings about the actions they describe, rather than implicit motor routines.

The current study examined whether the difficulty in inhibiting attention to negative information contributes to rumination and to rumination-related biases in memory. Seventy-nine ruminators underwent a 3-week computer-based training, designed to increase either inhibition of negative words or attention to them. On immediate post-training trials, as well as on 2-week follow-up tests, we found evidence for transfer of inhibition training. Training effects also occurred on session-by-session and post-training measures of state rumination, but not on a measure of trait rumination, assessed 2 weeks later. Finally, participants who were trained to inhibit negative material subsequently showed less negative bias on a memory test. These findings further establish the causal role of biased inhibition in rumination, and substantiate the view of rumination as a habit that encourages people to perceive, interpret, and remember events in a repetitive self-focused manner.

Latifnejad			How do I deal with breast cancer: a qualitative inquiry into the coping strategies of Iranian women survivors	BMC WOMENS HEALTH			English	Article						Breast cancer; Content analysis; Coping strategies; Coping styles; Iranian women	BODY-IMAGE; OF-LIFE; HEALTH; CHEMOTHERAPY; MASTECTOMY; EXPERIENCE; FRAMEWORK; SYMPTOMS; ILLNESS; STRESS	Background Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in Iran. Understanding the coping strategies employed by cancer survivors can provide valuable information for designing interventions to help them adapt to the problems produced by cancer and its treatment. This study aimed to explore the coping strategies of BC survivors in Iran. Methods This qualitative study was conducted in Mashhad, Northeast Iran, between April and December 2021. Fourteen BC survivors were selected through purposive sampling. The data were collected using semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis adopted by Graneheim and Lundman. MAXQDA 12 software was used for data organization. Components of trustworthiness, including credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability, were considered. Results The main categories that emerged from the participants' data analysis were "behavioral coping strategies" and "emotional coping strategies." Behavioral coping strategies included efforts to adopt healthy nutrition, attempts to improve a healthy lifestyle, maintenance of everyday activities, use of specialized cancer support consultation services, and seeking to increase health literacy about BC. The emotional coping strategies consisted of denial as a temporary escape route, positive thinking and focusing on the positive aspects of life, reinforcement of spirituality, and seeking the support of relatives. Conclusion Our findings provide an in-depth understanding of Iranian women's strategies for coping with BC. A trained team of oncologists, psychiatrists, mental health professionals, and reproductive health specialists needs to contribute significantly to improving the coping ability of patients with cancer, which could lead to enhanced health promotion and a higher quality of life.

Deep sequencing methodologies have played a key role in this knowledge accumulation, profoundly facilitating the study of the biology of disease vectors lacking reference genomes. For example, the nucleotide sequences of the entire set of tick salivary effectors, the so-called tick 'sialome', now contain at least one order of magnitude more transcript sequences compared to similar projects based on Sanger sequencing. Tick feeding is a complex and dynamic process, and while the dynamic 'sialome' is thought to mediate tick feeding success, exactly how transcriptome dynamics relate to tick-host-pathogen interactions is still largely unknown. The identification and, importantly, the functional analysis of the tick 'sialome' is expected to shed light on this 'black box'. This information will be crucial for developing strategies to block pathogen transmission, not only for anti-tick vaccine development but also the discovery and development of new, pharmacologically active compounds for human diseases.

Design/methodology/approach - This study investigates the effect of the advertising context, which is the background of the ad provided by the vehicle carrying it, in transferring a celebrity athlete's image. Findings - The results indicate that the presentation of a celebrity athlete in an advertising context that is congruent with the professional expertise of the athlete enables the more effective transfer of the athlete's image to the brand's image compared with the incongruent advertising context. In addition, the findings suggest that image attributes perceived as belonging to the professional expertise of an athlete are transferred more effectively by a context-congruent advertisement, while image attributes based on the sociocultural influence of an athlete show no difference in image transfer based on the advertising context. Originality/value - Although the advertising context has been thought to influence advertising effectiveness, no specific research has thus far analyzed the relationship between image transfer and the advertising context in the sports marketing literature.

Although most of the producers of geosmin and MIB have been identified as Streptomyces species or cyanobacteria, Streptomyces spp. are thought to be responsible for the synthesis of these compounds in indoor recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). The detection of genes involved in the synthesis of geosmin and MIB can be a relevant indicator of the beginning of off-flavour events in RAS. Here, we report a real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) protocol targeting geoA sequences that encode a germacradienol synthase involved in geosmin synthesis. New geoA-related sequences were retrieved from eleven geosmin-producing Actinomycete strains, among them two Streptomyces strains isolated from two RAS. Combined with geoA-related sequences available in gene databases, we designed primers and standards suitable for qPCR assays targeting mainly Streptomyces geoA. Using our qPCR protocol, we succeeded in measuring the level of geoA copies in sand filter and biofilters in two RAS. This study is the first to apply qPCR assays to detect and quantify the geosmin synthesis gene (geoA) in RAS. Quantification of geoA in RAS could permit the monitoring of the level of geosmin producers prior to the occurrence of geosmin production. This information will be most valuable for fish producers to manage further development of off-flavour events. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Revisiting paradigms of Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> signaling protein kinase regulation in plants	BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL			English	Review							CALMODULIN-LIKE DOMAIN; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN; N-TERMINAL DOMAIN; METAL-ION-BINDING; CASTOR-OIL SEEDS; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; SALT TOLERANCE; QUANTITATIVE PHOSPHOPROTEOMICS; TYROSINE PHOSPHORYLATION; SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION	Calcium (Ca2+) serves as a universal second messenger in eukaryotic signal transduction. Understanding the Ca2+ activation kinetics of Ca2+ sensors is critical to understanding the cellular signaling mechanisms involved. In this review, we discuss the regulatory properties of two sensor classes: the Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPKs/CDPKs) and the calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins that control the activity of CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) and identify emerging topics and some foundational points that are not well established experimentally. Most plant CPKs are activated by physiologically relevant Ca2+ concentrations except for those with degenerate EF hands, and new results suggest that the Ca2+-dependence of kinase activation may be modulated by both protein-protein interactions and CPK autophosphorylation. Early results indicated that activation of plant CPKs by Ca2+ occurred by relief of autoinhibition. However, recent studies of protist CDPKs suggest that intramolecular interactions between CDPK domains contribute allosteric control to CDPK activation. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms regulating plant CPKs. With CBL-CIPKs, the two major activation mechanisms are thought to be (i) binding of Ca2+-bound CBL to the CIPK and (ii) phosphorylation of residues in the CIPK activation loop. However, the relative importance of these two mechanisms in regulating CIPK activity is unclear. Furthermore, information detailing activation by physiologically relevant [Ca2+] is lacking, such that the paradigm of CBLs as Ca2+ sensors still requires critical, experimental validation. Developing models of CPK and CIPK regulation is essential to understand how these kinases mediate Ca2+ signaling and to the design of experiments to test function in vivo.

In this device, the b-TiO2/CdS:Eu/Ti3C2 heterojunction with excellent energy level arrangement effectively facilitated photoelectric conversion efficiency and accelerated the separation of the photogenerated electron hole pairs, which because that the structure of heterojunction overcomes the drawbacks of single material, such as narrow light absorption range, wide band gap, short carrier lifetime, etc., improves light utilization, extends the lifetime of photogenerated electron hole pairs, and promotes electron transfer. Herein, hairpin DNA1 (H1) decorated on the b-TiO2/CdS:Eu/Ti3C2 electrode surface by Cd-S bonds, after H-2/miRNA-21 heterduplex was introduced, the strand-displacement reaction (SDR) was triggered between H-1 and H-2/miRNA-21, accordingly, miRNA-21 was discharged from the H-2/miRNA-21 heterduplex, forming the H1/H2 duplex, and the reuse of miRNA-21 was realized. As a signal amplification factor, the signal amplification factor H-3-CdSe was hybridized with H-1/H-2 duplex, which greatly enhanced the sensitivity of the PEC biosensor. Under optimal conditions, the designed PEC biosensor displayed outstanding sensitivity, selectivity and stability with a wide liner range from 1.0 mu M to 10.0 fM and a low detection limit of 3.3 fM. The preparation of the optoelectronic material affords a new direction for the progress of heterojunction photovoltaic materials and the construction of the proposed biosensor also provides a new thought for the PEC detection of human miRNA-21 with superior performance. Simultaneously, the established biosensor exhibiting tremendous possibility for detecting other biomarkers and biomolecules in clinical diagnosis fields.

MethodWe surveyed PCPs in 11 practices affiliated with three health systems in Texas. Most practices had greater than 5 years of experience with the Epic EHR. The effect of early adopter of technology status was evaluated using logistic regression. ResultsOne hundred forty-six PCPs responded (70%). Most thought the EHR had a positive impact on routine tasks, such as prescription refills (94%), whereas fewer agreed for complex tasks, such as delivery of guideline-concordant care for chronic illnesses (51%). Two-thirds (62%) thought it interfered with eye contact with patients, and 40% reported that it interfered with in-visit communication. Early adopters of technology reported greater positive effects of the EHR, even after adjusting for age, ranging from 2% to 15% higher on satisfaction ratings. ConclusionPCPs practicing in settings with considerable experience using a common commercial EHR identified many positive effects, as well as two key areas for improvement - patient centredness and intelligent decision support. Providers with a propensity to adopt new technologies have more favourable perceptions of the EHR.

The Functional Field of View Is Narrower in Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SUPERIOR VISUAL-SEARCH; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; LOCAL PRECEDENCE; CHILDREN; PERCEPTION; AGE; ADOLESCENTS; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; DETAIL	Although social cognitive deficits have long been thought to underlie the characteristic and pervasive difficulties with social interaction observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), several recent behavioral and neuroimaging studies have indicated that visual perceptual impairments might also play a role. People with ASD show a robust bias towards detailed information at the expense of global information, although the mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon remain elusive. To address this issue, we investigated the functional field of view in a group of high-functioning children with autism (n = 13) and a paired non-ASD group (n = 13). Our results indicate that the ability to correctly detect and identify stimuli sharply decreases with greater eccentricity from the fovea in people with ASD. Accordingly, a probe analysis revealed that the functional field of view in the ASD group was only about 6.62 degrees of retinal eccentricity, compared with 8.57 degrees in typically developing children. Thus, children with ASD appear to have a narrower functional field of view. These results challenge the conventional hypothesis that the deficit in global processing in individuals with ASD is solely due to weak central coherence.

Genomics in Patient Care and Workforce Decisions in High-Level Isolation Units: A Survey of Healthcare Workers	HEALTH SECURITY			English	Article						COVID-19; ELSI; Biocontainment; Bioethics; Resource allocation; Epidemic Management; response; Genomics		The impact of host genomics on an individual's susceptibility, immune response, and risk of severe outcomes for a given infectious pathogen is increasingly recognized. As we uncover the links between host genomics and infectious disease, a number of ethical, legal, and social issues need to be considered when using that information in clinical practice or workforce decisions. We conducted a survey of the clinical staff at 10 federally funded Regional Ebola and Other Special Pathogen Treatment Centers to understand their views regarding the ethical, legal, and social issues related to host genomics and the administrative and clinical functions of high-level isolation units. Respondents overwhelmingly agreed that genomics could provide valuable information to identify patients and employees at higher risk for poor outcomes from highly infectious diseases. However, there was considerable disagreement about whether such data should inform the allocation of scarce resources or determine treatment decisions. While most respondents supported a confidential employer-based genomic testing system to inform individual employees about risk, respondents disagreed about whether such information should be used in staffing models. Respondents who thought genomic information would be valuable for patient treatment were more willing to undergo genetic testing for staffing purposes. Most respondents felt they would benefit from additional training to better interpret results from genetic testing. Although this study was completed before the COVID-19 pandemic, the responses provide a baseline assessment of provider attitudes that can inform policy during the current pandemic and in future infectious disease outbreaks.

Conductometric study of hydroelectrochemical parameters for the interaction of cadmium bromide in lump and nano forms with Orange G dye	MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Conductance; Association constants; Cadmium bromide; orange G; Complex formation; And thermodynamic parameters	DIELECTRIC-CONSTANT; WATER; CONDUCTANCE; MIXTURES; 25-DEGREES; CATION; ACID	The hydroelectrochemical behaviour of cadmium bromide was investigated in the presence of the dye Orange G. This information can be used to develop conductometric sensors for detecting these substances, understand how they behave in aqueous solutions, and design effective procedures for removing the extremely toxic heavy cadmium ions from contaminated water sources. The hydroelectrochemical parameters for the interaction between lump and nanoCdBr2 with Orange G dye were investigated conductometrically in aqueous solutions at different temperatures. CdBr2 interacts with Orange G as a ligand, resulting in a decrease in conductivity. However, the interaction was more significant with nanoCdBr2, which showed a higher decrease in conductivity compared to lump CdBr2. Two stiochiometric complexes, 1:1 and 1:2, were produced; Kf and Delta Gf are higher for 1:1 than for 1:2 (CdBr2/Orange G). With rising temperatures, the formation constants decreased, and the negative sign of Delta Gf indicated the spontaneity of the reaction, which increased with rising temperatures. The negative values of (Delta Hf) revealed the complexation's exothermic nature, whereas the positive entropy (Delta S) values confirmed that the complex formation depended on molecular entropy since the complex formation was favored by an increase in molecular disorder. The results of our investigation can be utilised to enhance comprehension of the behaviour of these materials in aqueous solutions and create efficient protocols for the removal of very toxic heavy metal cadmium ions from polluted water sources. We think that our study advances the discipline and offers a distinctive viewpoint on this subject.

Under the premise of strengthening flood control engineering measures and following the strategic thinking of sustainable development, many achievements have been made in flood forecasting recently. However, due to the complexity of the traditional lumped model and distributed model, the hydrologic parameter calibration process is full of difficulties, leading to a long development cycle of a reasonable hydrologic prediction model. Even for modern data-driven models, the spatial distribution characteristics of the rainfall data are also not fully mined. Based on this situation, this paper abstracts the rainfall data into the graph structure data, uses remote sensing images to extract the elevation information, introduces the graph attention mechanism to extract the spatial characteristics of rainfall, and employs long-term and short-term memory (LSTM) network to fuse the spatial and temporal characteristics for flood prediction. Through well-designed experiments, the forecasting effect of flood peak value and flood arrival time is verified. Furthermore, compared with the LSTM model and BIGRU model without spatial feature extraction, the advantages of spatiotemporal feature fusion are highlighted. The specific performance is that the RMSE (the root means square error) and R2 (coefficient of determination) of the GA-RNN model have been significantly improved. Finally, we conduct experiments on the observed ten rainfall events in the history of the target watershed. According to the hydrological prediction specifications, the model can be evaluated as a Class B flood forecasting model.

Primary sensory cortex is thought to process incoming sensory information, while decision variables important for driving behavior are assumed to arise downstream in the processing hierarchy. Here, we used population two-photon calcium imaging and targeted two-photon optogenetic stimulation of neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1) during a texture discrimination task to test for the presence of decision signals and probe their behavioral relevance. Small but distinct populations of neurons carried information about the stimulus irrespective of the behavioral outcome (stimulus neurons), or about the choice irrespective of the presented stimulus (decision neurons). Decision neurons show categorical coding that develops during learning, and lack a conclusive decision signal in Miss trials. All-optical photostimulation of decision neurons during behavior improves behavioral performance, establishing a causal role in driving behavior. The fact that stimulus and decision neurons are intermingled challenges the idea of S1 as a purely sensory area, and causal perturbation suggests a direct involvement of S1 decision neurons in the decision-making process.

The WeChat Mini Program, a small smartphone application that functions within WeChat, has the potential to assist in symptom management. This study aimed to develop a symptom management WeChat Mini Program for parents and children with cancer aged 5-17 years old and evaluate its usability.Methods: Based on the semi-structured interviews with parents of children with cancer, experts in pediatric oncology and informatics and a survey of children's symptom experience, multidisciplinary research group meetings were conducted to confirm the structure and main contents of the Mini Program. The iterative method was used to develop the Mini Program. A mixed-method study was conducted to test its usability with 10 pairs of parents and children with cancer. The quantitative data were collected through the Poststudy System Usability Questionnaire, and qualitative data were collected from interviews.Results: The Mini Program "Child SMILE" was developed, which includes a symptom assessment and management module, an information and emotional support module, a communication module among the parents and medical professionals, and a personal information module. Most users reported that the Mini Program is user-friendly, with satisfaction scores on the Poststudy System Usability Questionnaire ranging from 5.2 to 5.7 (out of 7.0) in four dimensions. In qualitative interviews, most participants thought the Mini Program was convenient, easy to use, and helpful. Conclusions: It can be concluded that the Mini Program satisfies the needs of parents of children with cancer and has the potential to benefit the symptom management of children with cancer.

Design: The participants were purposively drawn from four clinical specialties: family and community medicine, oncology, intensive care and geriatrics. Detailed interviews were conducted in person. Content analysis was used to code the data, which were further analysed with both quantitative and qualitative techniques. Main results: Thirty-nine of the 40 participants favoured the use of advance directives in clinical care; physicians had somewhat less positive attitudes than nurses toward such directives. Advance directives were thought by participants to be helpful in resolving disagreements between patients and their families about treatment options; in making patients more comfortable, both physically and psychologically, during the process of dying; and in opening up communication and trust among patients, their families and health care professionals. Concerns about the use of advance directives focused on the lack of clarity in some patients' instructions, the absence of legal status for directives, the possible interference with a practitioner's clinical judgement, the adequacy and appropriateness of patients' information about their circumstances, and the type of intervention (passive or active) requested by patients. Conclusions: New regulations and legislation are making the use of advance directives more widespread. Health care professionals should participate in the development and implementation of these directives. Continuing professional education is essential in this regard.

Pedigrees, MHC and microsatellites: an integrated approach for genetic management of captive African wild dogs (<i>Lycaon pictus</i>)	CONSERVATION GENETICS			English	Article						Lycaon pictus; Captive breeding; MHC; Neutral markers; Studbook; Pedigree	POPULATION-STRUCTURE; BREEDING PROGRAMS; POLYMORPHISM; REPRESENTATION; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; ALLELES; DESIGN	Captive breeding programmes aim to provide an insurance against extinction in the wild and a source for re-introductions making it essential to minimise genetic threats, and maximise representation of wild adaptive genetic diversity. As such, genetic assessments of captive breeding programmes are increasingly common. However, these rarely include comprehensive comparisons with wild populations and typically neutral, rather than adaptive, genetic diversity is assayed. Moreover, genetic data are rarely integrated with studbook information, which enables the most robust assessments. Here we use the European captive African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) population to demonstrate the utility of this combined approach. Specifically, we combined studbook pedigree information with genetic assessments of captive and wild samples at both neutral markers and a locus thought to be important for adaptation (a gene at the Major Histocompatibility Complex, MHC). With these data we were able to evaluate founder origin and representation, as well as the distribution and origin of genetic variation within the captive population. We found discrepancies between diversity metrics derived from neutral and adaptive markers and pedigree versus genetic derived inbreeding estimates. Overall, however, we found a large proportion of genetic diversity from wild populations to be conserved in the captive population, much of which can be attributed to recent imports from outside of the European breeding programme. Nonetheless, we also found a high incidence of inbreeding and very skewed founder contributions. Based on these results, we proposed and implemented a genetic management plan to prevent further losses of diversity and reduce inbreeding.	[Marsden, C. D.; Mable, B.

Cross-sectional associations between psychological traits, and HPV vaccine uptake and intentions in young adults from the United States	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COGNITIVE REFLECTION TEST; HEALTH-CARE; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; UNCONSCIOUS THOUGHT; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; INFORMATION; UNCERTAINTY; THINKING; NEED; ACCEPTABILITY	Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection worldwide and can lead to the development of genital warts, and cancers throughout the body. Despite the availability of HPV vaccines for over a decade, uptake in the United States among adolescents and young adults remains well below national targets. While most efforts to improve HPV vaccine uptake have rightly focused on adolescents, there is still a tremendous opportunity to improve vaccination among young adults who have not been vaccinated against HPV. To that end, we report an exploratory examination of associations between HPV vaccination status and intentions with psychological traits that may impact HPV vaccine uptake with a national, demographically diverse sample of young adults (N = 1358) who completed an online survey. These psychological traits conceptually mapped onto motivations to: 1) understand health-related information, 2) deliberate, 3) manage uncertainty, and 4) manage threats. We found notable gender differences for the association of these motivations and vaccination status. For women, higher interest in and ability to understand health related information seemed to distinguish those who reported receiving the HPV vaccine from those who did not. For men, less need to deliberate and greater needs to manage threat and uncertainty seemed to be the distinguishing motives for those who reported receiving the HPV vaccine compared to those who did not. Results for vaccination intentions were less consistent, but there was some evidence to indicate that, regardless of gender, greater health-related information interest and understanding and need to manage uncertainty and threats were associated with increased intention to receive the HPV vaccine, while greater need to deliberate was associated with decreased vaccination intentions. These results suggest that there are psychological differences that are associated with HPV vaccination decisions and that these motivations should be considered in efforts to improve that no competing interests exist. HPV vaccine uptake.

The objective of this study is to investigate the needs of students with DM1 during the school day from the perspective of both teachers and parents. A mixed methods study was designed and a questionnaire was administered to practicing teachers in Pre-primary Education, Primary Education, Compulsory Secondary Education, and Further Education, as well as Vocational Education within both the province and the city of Burgos (Castile and Leon, Spain) who may have students with DM1. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with mothers and fathers, members of the Burgos Diabetics Association (ASDIBUR). In the questionnaires administered to the teaching staff, 54.8% affirmed that they knew of students with DM1 at their centers. Of those questioned, 51.2% affirmed that they knew of the existence of action protocols on DM, and 45.2% declared that they had received specialized information on the illness; 92.8% believed that there was no discrimination at their center towards students with DM, and 82.8% thought that the educational center raised no objections to students with DM departing on trips during the school year. In their interviews, both family and teachers assessed the material and human resources as insufficient and called for the presence of school nurses at the educational centers. It is important to raise the awareness of the educational community about the needs of students with DM1 and to provide guidelines on emergency situations to teachers and staff at the centers.

J	Yang, ZQ; Zhou, LY; Jing, ZJ				Yang, Zhuqing; Zhou, Liya; Jing, Zhengjun			A Novel Affective Analysis System Modeling Method Integrating Affective Cognitive Model and Bi-LSTM Neural Network	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION	The severity of mental health issues among college students has increased over the past few years, having a significant negative impact on not only their academic performance but also on their families and even society as a whole. Therefore, one of the pressing issues facing college administrators right now is finding a method that is both scientific and useful for determining the mental health of college students. In pace with the advancement of Internet technology, the Internet has become an important communication channel for contemporary college students. As one of the main forces in the huge Internet population, college students are at the stage of growing knowledge and being most enthusiastic about new things, and they like to express their opinions and views on study life and social issues and are brave to express their emotions. These subjective text data often contain some affective tendencies and psychological characteristics of college students, and it is beneficial to dig out their affective tendencies to further understand what they think and expect and to grasp their mental health as early as possible. In order to address the issue of assessing the mental health of college students, this study makes an effort to use public opinion data from the university network and suggests a college student sentiment analysis model based on the OCC affective cognitive model and Bi-LSTM neural network. In order to label three different types of positive, negative, and neutral sentiment on the microblog text of college network public opinion, we first design a sentiment rule system based on the OCC affective cognition elicitation mechanism. In order to effectively and automatically identify the sentiment state of college students in the network public opinion, this study uses a Bi-LSTM neural network to classify the preprocessed college network public opinion data. Finally, this study performs comparison experiments to confirm the validity of the Bi-LSTM neural network sentiment recognition algorithm and the accuracy of the OCC sentiment rule labeling system. The findings show that the college student sentiment recognition effect of the model is significantly enhanced when the OCC sentiment rule system is used to label the college network public opinion data set as opposed to the naturally labeled data set. In contrast to SVM and other classification models like CNN and LSTM, the Bi-LSTM neural network-based classification model achieves more satisfactory classification results in the recognition of college opinion sentiment.

The small proportion of trisomy 21 oocytes thought to be retarded in their maturation in comparison to normal disomic ones, and the maternal age effect can be based on an accumulation of trisomy 21 oocytes in the ovarian reserve. By lowering the number of unnecessary ovulations, a greater portion of disomic oocytes might be saved. Study design: Between September 2009 and September 2011, we performed genetic amniocentesis for fetal chromosomal analysis in 5222 pregnancies. We detected 119 structural or numerical chromosomal abnormalities. We collected data from 37 cases who were in advanced maternal age and where fetal trisomy 21, 18 or 13 was confirmed. We had 92 control patients. Detailed information was taken from those factors that influence the number of ovulations in reproductive life. Results: From the factors checked, patients with a trisomic fetus had a shorter overall mean length of oral contraceptive pill use before the trisomic pregnancy (3.4 vs. 6.0 years, p<.0014), and the estimated number of mean ovulations was higher (274.6 vs. 224, p<.0003). Conclusion: We found that a history of longer oral contraceptive pill use and fewer ovulatory cycles were associated with fewer common trisomies of the fetus. Additional research is needed to rule out potential confounding factors, but our results are consistent with the maternal ovarian mosaicism causal model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Patients' views on their roles in these processes are often lacking despite the knowledge that patient participation contributes to enhanced safety and wellbeing. Objective: This study aims to improve the knowledge and understanding of patients' perspectives about their participation in handover. Methods: Twenty-three Swedish patients with chronic diseases were individually interviewed about their experiences with handovers between three clinical microsystems: emergency room, emergency ward and primary healthcare centres. Data were analysed using inductive qualitative content analysis. Results: Patients participated within the microsystems by exchanging information, and between microsystems by making contact with and conveying information to their next healthcare provider. Enablers for participation included positive encounters with providers, patient empowerment and beliefs about organisational factors. Patients' trust in their providers, and providers' attitudes were important factors in patients' willingness to communicate. Patients who thought medical records access was shared across microsystems volunteered less information to their providers. Patients with experiences of non-effective handovers took more responsibility in the handover to ensure continuity of care. Conclusions: Patients participate actively in handovers when they feel a need for involvement to ensure continuity of care, and are less active when they perceive that their contribution is unnecessary or not valued. In acute care settings with short hospital stays and less time to establish a trusting relationship between patients and their providers, discharge encounters may be important enablers for patient engagement in handovers. The advantages of a redundant handover process need to be considered.

J	Castro, C; Pereira, T; Sá, JC; Santos, G				Castro, Catarina; Pereira, Teresa; Sa, J. C.; Santos, Gilberto			Logistics reorganization and management of the ambulatory pharmacy of a local health unit in Portugal	EVALUATION AND PROGRAM PLANNING			English	Article						Hospital ambulatory pharmacy; Inventory management; Advanced warehouse; Replenishment by levels	QUALITY; SYSTEM; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; INTEGRATION; BENEFITS; MODEL	The Hospital Pharmacy of a Local Health Unit (LHU) in greater Oporto plays a major role in the community. In addition to providing medicines to the entire Internal Unit, it has created a service called "Hospital Ambulatory Pharmacy", which allows continued hospital treatments at home, in a more comfortable and familiar environment. This is mostly due uderfunding which has hindered recruitment of health professionals as well a growing concern for the comfort of patients as they convalesce. The Hospital Ambulatory Pharmacy's main problems are both recurring stock-outs and over-stocks; the fact that medicines's delivery routes are not completed, and that medical staff lacks awareness of the techniques to overcome the logistic issues involved. As a methodology, a context analysis was carried out, KPI's were created to quantify the problems and raise health professionals' awareness of what was happening. Solutions for storage were analysed and visits were made to a central hospital to analyse the solutions adopted to solve the same problems. The most appropriate inventory management policies were considered for the organization of existing and further resources. We chose to create an Advanced Warehouse with Level Replenishment. The levels were defined considering the demand of each medicine and divided into three different classes to use the best strategy for each type of demand. Then, and with the help of the LHU IT team, the inventory management module of the information system was parameterized, so stock replenishment could be done electronically. All these changes resulted in a 30 % reduction in stock-out. At the beginning of the study, stock-outs would reach peaks of 6 %. These were reduced to 4.5 % at a point at which professionals were already more aware of the logistic problem, and finally to 1.5 %, in the final phase, at a time when the proposal had already been implemented. Over-stock was reduced by 66 %. Delivery routes were stipulated, and compliance was verified. A novel service developed to increase the well-being of patients monitored at home which it is intended to improve the service provided to the users and at the same time reduce operational costs. As a contribution to the knowledge, in addition to the case study presented to be a novelty in terms of scientific articles published because it is a service implemented in the distribution of medications to patients at home, mostly with oncologic diseases. Several methods from Lean Thinking were used, such as, Kanban System and Advanced Warehouse for inventory management levelling and optimization techniques, as well as, operational KPIs, with the purpose to reach out the improvement of program planning and evaluation. This approach resulted in some improvements, namely, the increase of the quality of the healthcare services for the population. And, in terms to reduce stock and excess stock-outs, to reduce inventory costs, setting the delivery routes, raising the entire medical team's awareness of the problem and committing to optimization a reality.

This selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element is predicted to form a hairpin and contains three regions of sequence invariance that are thought to interact with a specific protein or proteins. Specificity of RNA-binding protein recognition of cognate RNAs is usually characterized by the ability of the protein to recognize and distinguish between a consensus binding site and sequences containing mutations to highly conserved positions in the consensus sequence. Using a functional assay for the ability of wild-type and mutant SECIS elements to direct cotranslational selenocysteine incorporation, we have investigated the relative contributions of individual invariant nucleotides to SECIS element function. We report the novel finding that, for this consensus RNA motif, mutations at the invariant nucleotides are tolerated to different degrees in different elements, depending on the identity of a single nonconserved nucleotide. Further, we demonstrate that the sequences adjacent to the minimal element, although not required for function, can affect function through their propensity to base pair. These findings shed light on the specific structure these conserved sequences may form within the element. This information is crucial to the design of strategies for the identification of SECIS-binding proteins, and hence the elucidation of the mechanism of selenocysteine incorporation in eukaryotes.

J	Schweitzer, F; Rau, C; Gassmann, O; van den Hende, E				Schweitzer, Fiona; Rau, Christiane; Gassmann, Oliver; van den Hende, Ellis			Technologically Reflective Individuals as Enablers of Social Innovation	JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							EMBEDDED LEAD USERS; DISTINGUISHING RUMINATION; SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS; INFORMATION; CONSUMERS; TRANSFORMATION; MINDFULNESS; BENEFITS; INSIGHT; FUTURE	This paper identifies technologically reflective individuals and demonstrates their ability to develop innovations that benefit society. Technological reflectiveness (TR) is the tendency to think about the societal impact of an innovation, and those who display this capability in public are individuals who participate in online idea competitions focused on technical solutions for social problems (such as General Electric's eco-challenge, the James Dyson Award, and the BOSCH Technology Horizon Award). However, technologically reflective individuals also reflect in private settings (e.g., when reading news updates), thus requiring a scale to identify them. This paper describes the systematic development of an easy-to-administer multi-item scale to measure an individual's level of TR. Applying the TR scale in an empirical study on a health monitoring system confirmed that individuals' degree of TR relates positively to their ability to generate (1) more new product features and uses, (2) features with higher levels of societal impact, and (3) features that are more elaborated. This scale allows firms seeking to implement co-creation in their new product development (NPD) process and sustainable solutions to identify such individuals. Thus, this paper indicates that companies wishing to introduce new technological products with a positive societal impact may profit from involving technologically reflective individuals in the NPD process.

The Potential for Markers of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition to Improve Colorectal Cancer Outcomes: A Systematic Review	CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOMARKERS & PREVENTION			English	Review							LYMPH-NODE METASTASIS; PROGNOSTIC MARKER; TUMOR PROGRESSION; POOR-PROGNOSIS; INVASION FRONT; EXPRESSION; CARCINOMA; SURVIVAL; STAGE; EMT	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to be an important mechanism of cancer cell metastasis. Clinical measurement of EMT markers in primary tumors could improve risk stratification and treatment decisions by identifying patients who potentially have metastatic disease. To evaluate the potential of EMT markers that could be used for risk stratification for patients with colorectal cancer, we conducted a systematic review of studies (N = 30) that measured at least one of a selection of EMT markers in primary tumors and patient outcomes. Fifteen of 30 studies (50%) reported at least one statistically significant result supporting a role for one of the selected EMT markers in identifying patients at risk for worse outcomes. Importantly, however, we identified design inconsistencies that limited inferences and prevented meta-analysis of data. We offer a number of recommendations to make future studies more informative and standardized, including consistent sampling of different parts of the primary tumor, larger sample sizes, and measurement of both protein and RNA expression of a given EMT marker in the same tumors. Strengthening the literature per our recommendations could facilitate translating EMT markers to clinical use. (C) 2014 AACR.

Alpha and gamma oscillations characterize feedback and feedforward processing in monkey visual cortex	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						neurona; synchronization; attention; perceptual organization; phase coherence; Granger causality	FIGURE-GROUND SEGREGATION; STRIATE CORTEX; CORTICAL-NEURONS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; COMPUTATIONAL PRINCIPLES; CELLULAR MECHANISM; RHESUS-MONKEY; AREAS V1; ATTENTION	Cognitive functions rely on the coordinated activity of neurons in many brain regions, but the interactions between cortical areas are not yet well understood. Here we investigated whether low-frequency (alpha) and high-frequency (gamma) oscillations characterize different directions of information flow in monkey visual cortex. We recorded from all layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) and found that gamma-waves are initiated in input layer 4 and propagate to the deep and superficial layers of cortex, whereas alpha-waves propagate in the opposite direction. Simultaneous recordings from V1 and downstream area V4 confirmed that gamma- and alpha-waves propagate in the feedforward and feedback direction, respectively. Microstimulation in V1 elicited gamma-oscillations in V4, whereas microstimulation in V4 elicited alpha-oscillations in V1, thus providing causal evidence for the opposite propagation of these rhythms. Furthermore, blocking NMDA receptors, thought to be involved in feedback processing, suppressed alpha while boosting gamma. These results provide new insights into the relation between brain rhythms and cognition.

See vol. 79, pg. 5845, 2023)	JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING			English	Article; Retracted Publication						Computer-supported collaborative learning; Teaching assistant on demand; Computer-supported personalized learning; Customized IP-oriented template-based assignment; Best learning performance; Scale questionnaire	INSTRUCTION; FEEDBACK	How to find the best learning performance in the network experimental course is an important research topic. Therefore, collaborative learning and personalized learning have been applied in traditional classes for a similar significance regardless of how times change and advancements develop. We used the computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) pedagogy with NetGuru network experimental platform and the computer-supported personalized learning (CSPL) pedagogy with the teaching assistant on demand (TAoD) network experimental platform, respectively, in the "Network Engineering Lab (1)" course to assess the distinctions in impacts for the two methods. The objective students were four junior classes of ordinary students in the department of Computer Information and Network Engineering. As a rule, one should think about that CSCL pedagogy is better than CSPL pedagogy because of discussion and collaborative learning between students for learning performances. Nonetheless, the fact that the missing and late rates of students in technical and vocational college are a lot higher that makes adopting CSCL pedagogy difficult. Therefore, we designed and made some assistant materials of "graphical-based teaching powerpoint slides," "animations of packet transmission process for network protocol theories," and "Customized IP-oriented template-based assignments (simplified as CIPOTA or template-based assignment)" to be applied to compare and analyze the network practices of CSCL-based on NetGuru platform and CSPL-based on TAoD platform. We also design "satisfaction scale of learning performance" to analyze the students' satisfaction degrees of learning performance with the pedagogy (CSCL or CSPL), the assignment form (normal assignment or template-based assignment), and the learning satisfaction (CSCL or CSPL combines the normal assignment or template-based assignment). They were for the most part being utilized to demonstrate that TAoD platform-based CSPL pedagogy is truly appropriate for network experiment courses. And the CSPL pedagogy is not more terrible than the CSCL pedagogy and may even bring about optimizing learning results for the learning of network experiment course.

These can help bridge the reported gap between the actual versus the expected soft skills and personae of young graduates transitioning to the creative industries today. CoPs are groups of people who share a common interest in an area of 'endeavor' and connect to co-create competence in that area through their practice.This paper makes two overarching research contributions. First, it informs about the design, enactment, and evaluation of a student CoP in an undergraduate Design course which was expanded to include members from the industry as clients, alumni mentors, and expert evaluators. Drawing from rich empirical data, the paper explains the designed and emergent learning phenomena of CoP participation and its effects on the students' creative and socio-epistemic outcomes, as well as their pre-professional identities. Second, it presents a governance model with three sets of actionable guidelines, namely the Set (technology), the Social (collaborative), and the Epistemic (learning) components. The entire body of work validates the critical interlocking of these components to form a robust social learning model that appropriates the complex practices of cross-organizational CoPs in Higher Education Design studies.

Clusters in Short-term Disease Course in Participants With Primary Dupuytren Disease	JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME			English	Article						Disease course; disease progression; disease regression; Dupuytren contracture; Dupuytren disease	CONTRACTURE; PREVALENCE; RADIOTHERAPY; PROGRESSION; MANAGEMENT; NODULES	Purpose The course of Dupuytren disease (DD) is thought to be progressive; however, the course differs for each patient. The purpose of this study was to study the rate and pattern of progression of DD. Methods We prospectively analyzed the course of DD at intervals of 3 to 6 months in 247 Dutch participants with primary DD by measuring the surface area of nodules and cords and the total passive extension deficit. The association between surface area and Tubiana stage was tested with generalized estimating equations. Latent class models were used to study different clusters in changes regarding the course of the disease. Results The variance in disease course between participants was large. Regarding the change in surface area (in all fingers) and total passive extension deficit (in the ring and little finger), different clusters were observed. Progression of disease was seen but there were also signs of stability and even regression. Patients with a smaller surface area at baseline were more likely to exhibit regression. Conclusions This study showed that DD is not always progressive and that up to 75% of patients have a different short-term disease course, such as stability or even regression of disease. This should be taken into account when evaluating the effects of treatment for early-phase DD and in the design of future studies. Furthermore, this information may be useful when counseling patients. (Copyright (C) 2016 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. All rights reserved.)	[Lanting, Rosanne; Werker, Paul M.

Primary Intensivists and Nurses for Long-Stay Patients: A Survey of Practices and Perceptions at Academic PICUs*	PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						child; continuity of patient care; intensive care units; pediatric; long-term care; models; nursing; practice patterns; physician's	CARE-UNIT; FAMILY-MEMBERS; MORAL DISTRESS; OF-LIFE; CHILDREN; IMPACT; MORTALITY; PROVIDERS; PARENTS	Objectives:To determine the prevalence of the utilization of primary intensivists and primary nurses for long-stay patients in large, academic PICU and ascertain how these practices are operationalized and perceived. Design:A cross-sectional survey. Setting:U.S. PICUs with accredited Pediatric Critical Care Medicine fellowships. Subjects:One senior physician and one senior nurse at each institution. Intervention:None. Measurements and Main Results:Separate but largely analogous questionnaires for intensivists and nurses were created using an iterative process to enhance content/face validity and readability. Sixty-seven intensivists (representing 93% of the 72 institutions with fellowship programs and their PICUs) and 59 nurses (representing 82%) responded. Twenty-four institutions utilize primary intensivists; 30 utilize primary nurses; and 13 utilize both. Most institutions use length of stay and/or other criteria (e.g., medical complexity) for eligibility. Commonly, not all patients that meet eligibility criteria receive primaries. Primary providers are overwhelmingly volunteers, and often only a fraction of providers participate. Primary intensivists at a large majority (>75%) of institutions facilitate information sharing and decision-making, attend family/team meetings, visit patients/families regularly, and are otherwise available upon request. Primary nurses at a similar majority of institutions provide consistent bedside care, facilitate information sharing, and attend family/team meetings. A large majority of respondents thought that primary intensivists increase patient/family satisfaction, reduce their stress, improve provider communication, and reduce conflict, whereas primary nurses similarly increase patient/family satisfaction. More than half of respondents shared that these practices can sometimes require effort (e.g., time and emotion), complicate decision-making, and/or reduce staffing flexibility. Conclusions:Primary practices are potential strategies to augment rotating PICU care models and better serve the needs of long-stay and other patients. These practices are being utilized to varying extents and with some operationalization uniformity at large, academic PICUs.

Wetlands are also key sites for production of the bioaccumulative neurotoxin methylmercury (MeHg), but little is known about MeHg production in created systems. Here, we studied methylmercury in sediment, water, and invertebrates in created wetlands of various ages. Sediment MeHg reached 8 ng g(-1) in the newest wetland, which was significantly greater than in natural, control wetlands. This trend was mirrored in several invertebrate taxa, whose concentrations reached as high as 1.6 mu g g(-1) in the newest wetland, above levels thought to affect reproduction in birds. The MeHg concentrations in created wetland invertebrate taxa generally decreased with increasing wetland age, possibly due to a combination of deeper anoxia and less organic matter accumulation in younger wetlands.

J	Ekins, S; Ring, BJ; Grace, J; McRobie-Belle, DJ; Wrighton, SA				Ekins, S; Ring, BJ; Grace, J; McRobie-Belle, DJ; Wrighton, SA			Present and future in vitro approaches for drug metabolism	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Review						metabolism; cytochrome P450; in vitro	DYNAMIC ORGAN-CULTURE; HUMAN LIVER-MICROSOMES; XENOBIOTIC METABOLISM; NONSPECIFIC-BINDING; OMEGA-HYDROXYLATION; EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN; ENZYME-INHIBITION; CYTOCHROME P450S; RHESUS-MONKEY; PHASE-I	The 1980s through 1990s witnessed the widespread incorporation of in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) approaches into drug development by drug companies. This has been exemplified by the integration of the basic science of cytochrome P450s (CYPs) into most drug metabolism departments so that information on the metabolic pathways of drugs and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is no longer an academic exercise, but essential for regulatory submission. This has come about due to the application of a variety of new technologies and in vitro models. For example, subcellular fractions have been widely used in metabolism studies since the 1960s. The last two decades has seen the increased use of hepatocytes as the reproducibility of cell isolations improved. The 1990s saw the rejuvenation of liver slices (as new slicers were developed) and the utilization of cDNA expressed enzymes as these technologies matured. In addition, there has been considerable interest in extrapolating in vitro data to in vivo for parameters such as absorption, clearance and DDIs. The current philosophy of drug development is moving to a 'fail early-fail cheaply' paradigm. Therefore, in vitro ADME approaches are being applied to drug candidates earlier in development since they are essential for identifying compounds likely to present ADME challenges in the latter stages of drug development. These in vitro tools are also being used earlier in lead optimization biology, in parallel with approaches for optimizing target structure activity relationships, as well as identification of DDI and the involvement of metabolic pathways that demonstrate genetic polymorphisms. This would suggest that the line between discovery and development drug metabolism has blurred. In vitro approaches to ADME are increasingly being linked with high-throughput automation and analysis. Further, if we think of perhaps the fastest available way to screen for successful drugs with optimal ADME characteristics, then we arrive at predictive computational algorithms, which are only now being generated and validated in parallel with in vitro and in vivo methods. In addition, as we increase the number of ADME parameters determined early, the overall amount of data generated for both discovery and development will increase. This will present challenges for the efficient and fast interpretation of such data, as well as incorporation and communication to chemistry, biology, and clinical colleagues. This review will focus on and assess the nature of present in vitro metabolism approaches and indicate how they are likely to develop in the future. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

The central pair of microtubules (CP) is important for cilia/flagella beating, as clearly shown by primary ciliary dyskinesia resulting from the loss of the CP. The CP is thought to regulate axonemal dyneins through interaction with radial spokes (RSs). However, the nature of the CP-RS interaction is poorly understood. Here we examine the appearance of CPs in the axonemes of a Chlamydomonas mutant, bld12, which produces axonemes with 8 to 11 outer-doublets. Most of its 8-doublet axonemes lack CPs. However, in the double mutant of bld12 and pf14, a mutant lacking the RS, most 8-doublet axonemes contain the CP. Thus formation of the CP apparently depends on the internal space limited by the outer doublets and RSs. In 10- or 11-doublet axonemes, only 3-5 RSs are attached to the CP and the doublet arrangement is distorted most likely because the RSs attached to the CP pull the outer doublets toward the axonemal center. The CP orientation in the axonemes varies in double mutants formed between bld12 and mutants lacking particular CP projections. The mutant bld12 thus provides the first direct and visual information about the CP-RS interaction, as well as about the mechanism of CP formation.

Replicability of their outcomes in different contexts varies, and what makes some visiting programmes more successful than others is unclear. Objective We conducted a realist synthesis to develop theories of what makes educational outreach visiting integrating academic detailing work, for whom, under which circumstances and why, focusing on the clinician-visitor interaction when influencing prescribing of medicines in ambulatory care settings. Methods The realist review was performed in accordance with RAMESES standards. An initial programme theory was generated, academic databases and grey literature were screened for documents with detail on contexts, intervention and outcomes. Using realist logic of analysis, data from 43 documents were synthesised in the generation of a refined programme theory, supported by additional theoretical frameworks of learning and communication. Results Twenty-seven interdependent context-mechanism-outcome configurations explain how clinicians engage with educational outreach visits integrating academic detailing through programme design, what matters in programme design and the educational visitor-clinician interaction and how influence extends beyond the visit. They suggest that in addition to relevance, credibility and trustworthiness of a visit's contents, communication and clinical skills of educational visitors, the relationship between the educational visitor and clinician, built on a dialogue of learning from and sense-making with each other, creates conditions of critical thinking which are conducive to facilitating prescribing practice change when necessary. Conclusion This realist synthesis elucidates that the quality of clinician-educational visitor interactions is pivotal to educational outreach visiting programmes. Building and sustaining relationships, and establishing an open dialogue are important; neglecting these undermines the impact of visits. Educational visitors can facilitate clinicians' reflection on practice and influence their prescribing. Clinicians value the discussion of individualised, tailored information and advice they can translate into their practice. PROSPERO registration number CRD42021258199.

Selecting numerical scales for pairwise comparisons	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						Pairwise comparisons; Analytic hierarchy process; Multiattribute utility theory; Integer scale; Balanced scale; Power scale; Consistency ratio	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; AHP; RANKING; LAW	It is often desirable in decision analysis problems to elicit from an individual the rankings of a population of attributes according to the individual's preference and to understand the degree to which each attribute is preferred to the others. A common method for obtaining this information involves the use of pairwise comparisons, which allows an analyst to convert subjective expressions of preference between two attributes into numerical values indicating preferences across the entire population of attributes. Key to the use of pairwise comparisons is the underlying numerical scale that is used to convert subjective linguistic expressions of preference into numerical values. This scale represents the psychological manner in which individuals perceive increments of preference among abstract attributes and it has important implications about the distribution and consistency of an individual's preferences. Three popular scale types, the traditional integer scales, balanced scales and power scales are examined. Results of a study of 64 individuals responding to a hypothetical decision problem show that none of these scales can accurately capture the preferences of all individuals. A study of three individuals working on an actual engineering decision problem involving the design of a decay heat removal system for a nuclear fission reactor show that the choice of scale can affect the preferred decision. It is concluded that applications of pairwise comparisons would benefit from permitting participants to choose the scale that best models their own particular way of thinking about the relative preference of attributes.

Furthermore, the research aims to create a better understanding of the antecedents and consequences of market maven behavior. Design/methodology/approach - After creating rapport with them, the participants were given a blank sheet of paper and were asked to depict a cyber-market maven together with the environment in which he/she lives and the things he/she thinks. After drawing this, the participants were interviewed to answer questions associated with the picture's elements, and thematic analysis was used to interpret the data. Findings - The data interpretation indicated seven factors that determine cyber mavenism as well as three factors affected by such behavior. Practical implications - The study is useful for e-businesses wishing to target consumers who people perceive as good sources of marketplace information and who like introducing new brands to others, to use them as powerful sources in the context of co-producing products. In addition, cyber-mavens can help e-businesses amplify their new customer acquisition efforts by indicating which customer groups they should target with referral reward programs. Originality/value - This study represents one of the first attempts to better understand how mavens behave in virtual world channels, and, by doing so, it better informs our understanding of an important group of consumers, namely cyber-mavens. The paper could be of value to marketers and advertisers who target cyber-markets.

The role of dietitian clinical judgement in the nutrition care process within the acute care setting: a qualitative study	JOURNAL OF HUMAN NUTRITION AND DIETETICS			English	Article						acute care; clinical decision making; clinical dietetics; clinical reasoning; judgement; nutrition assessment	KNOWLEDGE; ACADEMY; EXPERT; MODEL	Background Dietitian clinical decision making in the acute care setting likely incorporates a practitioner's clinical judgement to effectively support patient care. The term 'dietitian clinical judgement' is well used in clinical practice, yet is poorly defined and often used interchangeably with other concepts. The aim of this research was to describe the nature of dietitians' clinical judgement in the acute care setting. Methods A qualitative design within the interpretative paradigm was used guided by principles of philosophical hermeneutics. Dietitians with at least 3 years experience were invited to participate in two 60-min in-depth semi-structured interviews which were recorded, transcribed and interpreted using hermeneutic principles. A reference group was used to increase rigour and further interpretation of the findings. Results Ten dietitians participated in the interviews and five of these same participants in the reference focus group. The findings revealed clinical judgement to be a sophisticated practitioner dependent meta-reasoning process that helps the dietitian manage complexity, guide interpersonal interactions and individualise patient care. It is characterised by tacit and efficient use of various reasoning strategies reliant on the dietitian's clinical experience, used to synthesise and weigh up various types of information and knowledge with respect to delivering context-relevant care. Conclusions Dietitian clinical judgement is a necessary part of clinical decision making that extends beyond logical or critical thinking. It facilitates a person-centredness to patient care and professional relationships that are key dimensions to dietitian clinical decision making. These findings provide training and professional development insights to managers, educators and supervisors.

The initiative, which builds on existing prevention activities, aims to strengthen the health prevention system through evidence-driven action to enable people to make good food choices, be physically active, smoke-free and free from alcohol-related harm. Key investment areas are a dedicated systems thinking and acting health promotion workforce, and activating leaders who can influence transformational change. The evaluation to date has found the initiative is being implemented with integrity. Evidence indicates a shift towards greater action on prevention, and the prevention system being strengthened. Maori ownership has been enabled, and prioritizing equity has led teams to utilize methods that amplify diverse local perspectives. There is progress on developing a flexible workforce through adaptive learning, flexible resources, professional development and a responsive National team. There is also progress in activating local leadership and empowering local teams. The initiative design has explicitly taken into account the context of complexity within which it is being implemented. It has evolved to focus on action that can accelerate sharing information and practices within communities, and between policy and decision-makers. Healthy Families NZ and its evaluation have been refunded to 2022. This provides an important opportunity to gather further insight into effective ways to strengthen the community agency and trust needed to promote and deliver evidence-based action on prevention.

This paper answers the question whether indicators can be derived from the barrier system status to provide information about the development and likelihood of the major accident processes in the ammonia production process. The accident processes are visualized as scenarios in bowties. This research focuses on the status of the preventive barriers on the left-hand side of the bowtie. Both the quality - expressed in reliability/availability and effectiveness - and the activation of the barrier system give an indication of the development of the accident scenarios and the likelihood of the central event. This likelihood is calculated as a loss of risk reduction compared to the original design. The calculation results in an indicator called "preventive barrier indicator", which should initiate further action. Based on an example, it is demonstrated which actions should be taken and what their urgency is.

Methods Nineteen people who had made a decision about brain donation, five people with Parkinson's and 14 unaffected individuals, were identified through theoretical sampling. Interviews conducted between September 2007January 2008 were analysed to identify themes representing the concerns of participants, when making a decision. Findings The three main themes identified were views and beliefs about post-mortem, the importance of family and the things people do not talk about. Although participants were more familiar with the concept of organ donation for transplantation, unanimous support was expressed for brain donation for research. However, beliefs about death and post-mortem, influence of family and the difficulty in talking and thinking about things to do with death all posed barriers to consent when actually asked to make a decision. For some, however, being asked had acted as a catalyst, transforming previously held positive attitudes into a decision to consent. Conclusion Guidelines for asking developed from these findings highlight the importance of discussing the issue to raise awareness in potential donors, involving family members, and giving accurate and appropriate information to inform, reassure and to dispel misconceptions.

Patients participating in voice therapy often express difficulty replicating therapy targets during their independent home practice. To assist patients, an iOS-based app was developed that calculates and displays cepstral peak prominence (CPP) values for patient self-monitoring of voice quality. The purpose of this study was to investigate the usability (ie ease of use) and utility (ie helpfulness) of this app in patient practice of resonant voice, and its effect on self-efficacy for practice. Design. This study used mixed methods including repeated measures, survey, and semi-structured interview. Methods/Results. A total of 14 individuals undergoing voice therapy for a variety of voice disorders produced sustained phonation and connected speech tasks in three sequential conditions: habitual voice quality, resonant voice quality achieved without clinician assistance, and resonant voice quality achieved in interaction with the CPP app. For both tasks, CPP values were significantly and progressively higher in subsequent conditions, indicating utility of mobile CPP to differentiate habitual voice quality from resonant voice production. The participants found the app easy to use as indicated by high System Usability Scale ratings, and rated self-efficacy for practice with the app significantly higher than for unassisted practice. The interviews suggested that the participants found numeric CPP feedback helpful in self-evaluating voice quality, and thought it was "fun" to use the app. Conclusion. CPP information provided on a mobile app has potential to assist and motivate patients in the achievement of resonant voice production.

Factors That Matter to Low-Income and Racial/Ethnic Minority Mothers When Choosing a Pediatric Practice: a Mixed Methods Analysis	JOURNAL OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES			English	Article						Pediatric healthcare quality; Choosing a pediatric practice; Low income; Minority; Pregnant women	HEALTH-CARE; QUALITY DATA; PREFERENCES; INFORMATION; GENDER; CHOICE	Background Pediatric practices' scores on healthcare quality measures are increasingly available to the public. However, patients from low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations rarely use these data. We sought to understand potential barriers to using quality data by assessing what factors mattered to women when choosing a pediatric practice. Methods As part of a randomized trial to overcome barriers to using quality data, we recruited women from a prenatal clinic serving an underserved population. Women reported how much 12 factors mattered when they chose a pediatric practice (5-point Likert scale), what other factors mattered to them, and which factors mattered the most. We assessed whether factor importance varied with selected participant characteristics and qualitatively analyzed the "other" factors named. Results Participants' (n = 367) median age was 23 years, and they were largely Hispanic (60.4%), white (21.2%), or black (16.9%). Insurance acceptance "mattered a lot' to the highest percentage of women (93.2%), while online information about what other parents think of a practice "mattered a lot" to the fewest (7.4%). Major themes from our qualitative analysis of "other" factors that mattered included physicians' interpersonal skills and pediatrician-specific traits. Factors related to access "mattered the most" to the majority of women. Conclusions Pediatrician characteristics and factors related to access to care may be more important to low-income and racial/ethnic minority women than more commonly reported quality metrics. Aligning both the content and delivery of publicly reported quality data with women's interests may increase use of pediatric quality data.

J	Clayton, HM; Hampson, A; Fraser, P; White, A; Egenvall, A				Clayton, Hilary M.; Hampson, Alexandra; Fraser, Peter; White, Arlene; Egenvall, Agneta			Comparison of rider stability in a flapless saddle versus a conventional saddle	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COORDINATION DYNAMICS; HORSE; DRESSAGE; TREADMILL; TROT; MOVEMENTS; FORCES; WALK; KINEMATICS; TRUNK	The purpose of a saddle is to improve the rider's safety, security, and comfort, while distributing the forces exerted by the rider and saddle over a large area of the horse's back without focal pressure points. This study investigates the effects on rider stability of an innovative saddle design that differs from a conventional saddle in having no flaps. Five horses were ridden by their regular rider in their usual saddle and in a flapless saddle. A pressure mat (60 Hz) placed between the saddle and the horse's back was used to determine the position of the center of pressure, which represents the centroid of pressure distribution on the horse's back. Data were recorded as five horses were ridden at collected and extended walk, trot and canter in a straight line. Data strings were split into strides with 5 strides analysed per horse/gait/type. For each stride the path of the rider's center of pressure was plotted, maximal and minimal values in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions were extracted, and ranges of motion in anteroposterior and mediolateral directions were calculated. Differences between the conventional and flapless saddles were analysed using mixed models ANOVA. Speed and stride length of each gait did not differ between saddles. Compared with the conventional saddle, the flapless saddle was associated with significant reductions in range of motion of the rider's center of pressure in the mediolateral direction in all gaits and in the anteroposterior direction in collected trot, extended trot and extended canter. The improved stability was thought to result from the absence of saddle flaps allowing the rider's thighs to lie in more adducted positions, which facilitated the action of the lumbopelvic-hip musculature in stabilizing and controlling translations and rotations of the pelvis and trunk. The closer contact between rider and horse may also have augmented the transfer of haptic information.

J	Laguna, L; Chen, JS				Laguna, Laura; Chen, Jianshe			The eating capability: Constituents and assessments	FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE			English	Article						Eating capability; Food oral processing; Texture modification; Mastication; Swallowing	PARTICLE-SIZE DISTRIBUTION; GRIP FORCE CONTROL; MASTICATORY PERFORMANCE; BITE FORCE; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; OLFACTORY DYSFUNCTION; OBJECT MANIPULATION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; VISION IMPAIRMENT; DENTURE WEARERS	With the rapid growth of elderly populations, the food industry is under increasing pressure to provide texture-modified food for safe consumption by these vulnerable populations. The imminent technical challenges to the manufacturing of food for elderly consumption are the lack of knowledge of the elderly's physiological capability to eat and swallow and, particularly, the lack of technical guidance in matching texture properties with the individual's capability of eating. This review proposes the term "Eating Capability" to represent the individual's abilities for food consumption. This term collectively includes the following four groups of quantifiable parameters: food handling capability (e.g., hand gripping, finger gripping, and coordination), oral manipulation capability (e.g., lips sealing, biting and mastication, tongue pressing, and swallowing), oral sensing capability (e.g., tasting and texture discrimination), and cognitive capability (e.g., information seeking and processing, opinion forming, and decision making). According to this definition, various capacities related to eating performance and, particularly, the implications of any impairment in such capability are discussed in detail in this paper; we pay particular attention to vulnerable elderly consumers. Another primary objective of the review is to introduce feasible techniques and methods that are currently available for quantitative assessment of these parameters. With the growing research activities in food for elderly, we hope that this review will stimulate new thinking and help the food industry to establish novel techniques to design and manufacture quality food for safe consumption by elderly people.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and pregnancy-potential for improvements in Australasian maternity health providers' knowledge	JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Congenital; cytomegalo-virus; health education; pregnancy; prevention	CONGENITAL CYTOMEGALOVIRUS; CESAREAN-SECTION; PREVENTION; AWARENESS; WOMEN	Purpose: To assess the knowledge, practice and attitudes of maternity clinicians regarding congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV). It is the most common congenital infection, and well-recognized cause of neurodevelopmental disability and hearing loss. New consensus recommendations state all pregnant women and health-care providers should be educated about congenital CMV infection and preventive measures. Materials and methods: An email questionnaire was distributed in October 2015 to specialists, diplomates (general practitioners), and trainees of the Royal Australian New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG), and Victorian and New South Wales midwives. Results: 774 responded: (37.3% specialists, 17.3% diplomates, 16.8% trainees, 28.6% midwives). Clinicians had variable knowledge of fetal sequelae, transmission routes and prevention. Overall, 30.2% felt confident about discussing CMV in pregnancy: less than 10% of midwives (7.4%) and less than half of specialists (47.1%, p<.0001). Only 8.8% of respondents routinely discussed CMV prevention with pregnant women. The majority (69.3%) responded that professional societies should make practice recommendations, and 88% thought more patient information was needed, preferably leaflets. Conclusions: Australasian maternity clinicians lack confidence and knowledge about congenital CMV. Few (<10%) routinely provide advice on prevention. There is urgent need for clinical guidance and patient information to reduce the burden of disease.	[Shand, A.

Acoustic emission mapping of diesel engines for spatially located time series - Part II: Spatial reconstitution	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						acoustic emission; condition monitoring; diesel engines; attenuation; spatial reconstitution	INJECTION PARAMETERS; IMPACT RESPONSE	In this study the characteristics of AE wave transmission around and through the cylinder head of a small four-stroke fuel injection diesel engine are investigated. Two sets of measurements have been carried out, one with simulated sources at various points on the cylinder head and one with the engine running, using a nine-sensor array. Propagation of AE waves from the simulated sources to the array sensor positions indicates attenuation factors of around 8.5. It is important to be able to estimate source-sensor distance accurately and this has been done using a threshold technique to identify the arrival time of a low frequency high amplitude wave at the sensors, then to deduce the wave speed from that information and hence calculate the source-sensor distance (transmission path length). Engine running tests were carried out and analysis focused on reconstitution of injector and exhaust valve opening events using signal mapping techniques. For injector events, the attenuation factors were similar to those measured from the simulated sources. For exhaust valve-opening events the attenuation factors varied between 5 and 7 with relatively poor correlation. This difference is thought to be due to variation in the actual source position during valve opening because the exhaust valve actuation involves a cam, push rod and rocker design. The results can be used to reconstitute the timing and amplitude of the AE emitted at the source which enables much more focussed monitoring of specific components and processes identified in the signals.

Can social media platforms be used to foster improved environmental behaviour in recreational fisheries?	FISHERIES RESEARCH			English	Article						Pro -environmental behaviour; Social media; Recreational fisheries; Fisheries management; Behavioural monitoring	CATCH-AND-RELEASE; HOOKING LOCATION; MORTALITY; ANGLERS; INJURY; SURVIVAL; MARINE; CAUGHT; RECOMMENDATIONS; CONSERVATION	Recreational fisheries are notoriously hard to manage, monitor and govern. This often requires managers to think "out of the box" and disregard traditional methodologies designed to manage fisher behaviour. Social media, which is an informal technological scholastic platform for the communication and dissemination of information, has become an important platform for community organisation and engagement in pertinent issues such as conservation, and has great potential for altering the behaviour of fishers. Recreational fishers use a variety of social media platforms to engage, communicate and organise themselves for a variety of reasons, yet its potential for promoting pro-environmental behaviour has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to explore whether user-generated content on Facebook has the potential to encourage pro-environmental behaviour among rec-reational anglers and to discuss how fisheries managers and scientists can facilitate this process. To do this we monitored angler environmental attitudes and behaviour on a large South African Facebook group, Salt Fishing South Africa (SFSA) (similar to 60,000 members, at the time of the study) and engaged with conceptual frameworks on the use of social media to facilitate pro-environmental behaviour. We found evidence for pro-environmental reform on the SFSA Facebook group, with significantly more catch and release posts, more pro-environmental comments, and improved fish handling practices over time, despite no intervention from fishery scientists or managers. These improvements were most likely attributed to a dedicated, conservation-driven, and well -recognised group administration, who used the informational, relational and experiential functions of Face -book to promote individual, social and contextual pathways for pro-environmental action. Fisheries scientists and managers should consider social media interventions as an important "softer approach" to aid in manage-ment of recreational fisheries. The approach should, however, be carefully considered and include the identi-fication and engagement with suitable groups, baseline assessments of attitudes and behaviour to identify areas of concern and the design of interventions specific for social media.

Creating a novel approach to discourse treatment through coproduction with people with aphasia and speech and language therapists	APHASIOLOGY			English	Article						aphasia; coproduction; discourse; assessment; treatment	WORD RETRIEVAL; QUALITY; STROKE; IMPACT; TIME	Background Although spoken discourse is an outcome prioritised by all stakeholders in aphasia rehabilitation, assessment and treatment of discourse are not routine clinical practice. The small evidence base, varied clinical expertise, multiple barriers in the workplace, and challenges for clients in understanding their altered language abilities all contribute to this situation. These factors need serious consideration when developing a new treatment. Involving intended stakeholders as partners in the development process is recommended. This assists with future implementation by ensuring assessment and treatment are practical, feasible, and acceptable to those who will deliver and undertake it. Aims This paper reports on the coproduction phase of the Linguistic Underpinnings of Narrative in Aphasia (LUNA) research project and describes the levels of partners' involvement, the outcomes and impact of coproduction, and the factors that influenced it. Methods and procedures Four partners with aphasia and four speech and language therapists (SLTs) worked with academic team members across a 6-month period to create the LUNA assessment and treatment. Separate sessions were held with partners with aphasia (monthly) and SLTs (fortnightly). Coproduction methods included open discussion, the Someone Who Isn't Me (SWIM) technique (thinking from others' perspectives), low and high fidelity prototypes, flexible brainstorming, card sort, and active experimentation with assessment and treatment tasks. Verbal and written information was presented, shared and documented during each session in supportive formats, and each session summarised as accessible minutes. Outcomes and Results Partners contributed at consultation, cooperation, and co-learning levels during the coproduction phase. Outcomes included joined-up thinking across assessment-goal setting-treatment-desired outcomes; agreed decisions and content for assessment protocol and treatment manual; clarity on personalised, meaningful, and relevant treatment; therapeutic alliance operationalised in treatment manual; and more. Impacts included increased confidence, self-knowledge, pride, validation, peer support, networking, and benefits to SLTs' services. Coproduction was positively influenced by consistent session structure and conduct, group dynamics, accessible communication methods, active task experimentation, and SWIM technique. Although the process was time and labour intensive, all partners considered this worthwhile. Conclusions LUNA has exemplified how an inclusive coproduction process can work well despite the language challenges of aphasia. Authors also believe that coproduction with intended users has resulted in products (assessment protocol, treatment manual) that are more practical, feasible, and acceptable to clinicians and clients than if designed by academics alone. This latter claim now needs testing on a wide scale.

J	Matsuoi, A; Sasahara, K; Taguchi, Y; Karasawa, M				Matsuoi, Akiko; Sasahara, Kazutoshi; Taguchi, Yasuhiro; Karasawa, Minoru			Development and validation of the Japanese Moral Foundations Dictionary	PLOS ONE			English	Article								The Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD) is a useful tool for applying the conceptual framework developed in Moral Foundations Theory and quantifying the moral meanings implicated in the linguistic information people convey. However, the applicability of the MFD is limited because it is available only in English. Translated versions of the MFD are therefore needed to study morality across various cultures, including non-Western cultures. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. We developed the first Japanese version of the MFD (referred to as the J-MFD) using a semi-automated method-this serves as a reference when translating the MFD into other languages. We next tested the validity of the J-MFD by analyzing open-ended written texts about the situations that Japanese participants thought followed and violated the five moral foundations. We found that the J-MFD correctly categorized the Japanese participants' descriptions into the corresponding moral foundations, and that the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ) scores correlated with the frequency of situations, of total words, and of J-MFD words in the participants' descriptions for the Harm and Fairness foundations. The J-MFD can be used to study morality unique to the Japanese and also multicultural comparisons in moral behavior.

J	Jia, MM; Jiang, HG; Li, WJ				Jia Mei-Mei; Jiang Hao-Gang; Li Wen-Jing			Generation and application of novel Chua multi-scroll chaotic attractors	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						Chua multi-scroll chaotic system; logarithmic function series; recursive back-stepping controllers; weak signal detection	SYNCHRONIZATION; SYSTEM; OSCILLATOR; DESIGN; SERIES	Chaos has great potential applications in engineering fields, such as secure communication and digital encryption. Since the double-scroll Chua' s circuit was developed first by Chua, it has quickly become a paradigm to study the double-scroll chaotic attractors. Compared with the conventional double-scroll chaotic attractors, the multi-scroll chaotic attractors have complex structures and rich nonlinear dynamical behaviors. The multi-scroll chaotic attractors have been applied to various chaos-based information technologies, such as secure communication and chaotic cryptanalysis. Hence, the generation of the multi-scroll chaotic attractors has become a hot topic in research field of chaos at present. In this paper, a novel Chua multi-scroll chaotic system is constructed by using a logarithmic function series. The nonlinear dynamical behaviors of the novel Chua multi-scroll chaotic system are analyzed, including symmetry, invariance, equilibrium points, the largest Lyapunov exponent, etc. The existence of chaos is confirmed by theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. The results show that the rich Chua multi-scroll chaotic attractors can be generated by combining the logarithmic function series with the novel Chua double-scroll chaotic system. The generation mechanism of the Chua multi-scroll chaotic attractors is that the saddle-focus equilibrium points of index 2 are used to generate the scrolls, and the saddle-focus equilibrium points of index 1 are used to connect these scrolls. Then, three recursive back-stepping controllers are designed to control the chaotic behavior in the novel Chua multi-scroll chaotic system. The recursive back-stepping controllers can control the novel Chua multi-scroll chaotic system to a fixed point or a given sinusoidal function. Finally, a new method of detecting a weak signal embedded in the Gaussian noise is proposed on the basis of the novel Chua multi-scroll chaotic system and the recursive back-stepping controllers. The immunity of the novel Chua multi-scroll chaotic system to the Gaussian noise with the zero mean is analyzed by using the stochastic differential equation theory. The results show that the proposed new method of detecting the weak signal can detect the frequencies of the multi-frequency weak periodic signal embedded in the Gaussian noise. In addition, the novel Chua multi-scroll chaotic system has strong immunity to any Gaussian noise with the zero mean. The proposed method provides a new thought for detecting the weak signal.

There is no overall picture of the nursing support for parents with hospitalized premature infants in Iran. Nurses, providing care in NICU, must view parent as an essential partner in care. But what is the situation? Assessing the viewpoints of both parents and nurses regarding the importance and availability of nursing support can elucidate this situation. Methods: A comparative descriptive design was used. The population consisted of all mothers with hospitalized premature newborns in NICU (n=300) and all NICU nurses (n=32) in three teaching hospitals in Tabriz (Iran), in 2007. Data was collected through the NPST questionnaire. Data analysis was done with SPSS. Findings: Mann-Whitney test showed that there were significant differences between nurses and mothers on four subscales of nursing support. Generally, mothers scored every subscale lower than nurses who cared for them and their children. On the other hand, it could be said that NICU nurses claimed more importance for the subscales and rated the provided support higher in comparison with mothers who did not think so. Conclusion: The opinions of the nurses and mothers toward the availability and importance of the nursing supports in NICU were different. This study provides nurses with concrete information in order to better understand parents' need for support and try to meet their expectations, resulting in improved nursing care in neonatal intensive care units.

J	Goudar, CT; Nanny, MA				Goudar, CT; Nanny, MA			A MATLAB toolbox for solving acid-base chemistry problems in environmental engineering applications	COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						acid-base chemistry; computer assisted instruction; MATLAB; wastewater treatment	BUFFERS	A MATLAB toolbox incorporating several computer programs has been developed in an attempt to automate laborious calculations in acid-base chemistry Such calculations are routinely used in several environmental engineering applications including the design of wastewater treatment systems and for predicting contaminant fate and transport in the subsurface. The computer programs presented in this study do not replace student thinking involved in formulating the problem solving strategy but are merely tools that simplify the actual problem solving process. They encompass a wide variety of acid-base chemistry topics including equilibrium constant calculations, construction of distribution diagrams for mono and multiprotic systems, ionic strength and activity coefficient calculations, and buffer index calculations. All programs are characterized by an intuitive graphical user interface where the user supplies input information. Program outputs are either numerical or graphical depending upon the nature of the problem. The application of this approach to solving actual acid-base chemistry problems is illustrated by computing the pH and equilibrium composition of a 0.1 M Na2CO3 system at 30 degrees C using several programs in the toolbox. As these programs simplify lengthy computations such as ionization fraction and activity coefficient calculations, it is hoped they will help bring more complicated problems to the environmental engineering classroom and enhance student understanding of important concepts that are applicable to real-world systems The programs are available free of charge for academic use from the authors.

Adolescent MDD patients attending NHS clinics show high rates of recurrence into adult life. A meta-analysis of recent research shows that psychological treatments are not as efficacious as previously thought. Modest treatment outcomes of approximately 65% of cases responding suggest that aetiological and clinical heterogeneity may hamper the better use of existing therapies and discovery of more effective treatments. Information with respect to optimal treatment choice for individuals is lacking, with no validated biomarkers to aid therapeutic decision-making. Methods/ Design: Magnetic resonance-Improving Mood with Psychoanalytic and Cognitive Therapies, the MR-IMPACT study, plans to identify brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of depressions and examine whether there are specific behavioural or neural markers predicting remission and/or subsequent relapse in a subsample of depressed adolescents recruited to the IMPACT randomised controlled trial (Registration #ISRCTN83033550). Discussion: MR-IMPACT is an investigative biomarker component of the IMPACT pragmatic effectiveness trial. The aim of this investigation is to identify neural markers and regional indicators of the pathophysiology of and treatment response for MDD in adolescents. We anticipate that these data may enable more targeted treatment delivery by identifying those patients who may be optimal candidates for therapeutic response.	[Hagan, Cindy C.; Graham, Julia M.

J	Nolan, CB; Tufford, DL; Chalcraft, DR				Nolan, Casey B.; Tufford, Daniel L.; Chalcraft, David R.			Needs Assessment of Coastal Land Managers for Drought Onset Indicators in the Southeastern United States	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Resource management; drought index; interview; coastal Carolinas	PRECIPITATION; INDEX; VARIABILITY; SENSITIVITY; VEGETATION; STABILITY; HYDROLOGY; IMPACTS; EVENTS; GROWTH	The ability to detect the onset of drought is important to coastal resource managers because the knowledge enhances preparedness and mitigation. Existing drought indicators, however, were generally designed with agricultural, hydrological, meteorological, socio-economic, or wildfire management in mind and generally quantify deficits in freshwater availability. It is unclear whether coastal resource managers find existing indicators adequate for managing coastal resources and, if not, what information would be most useful to manage resources under threat of drought. A needs assessment was conducted with 30 land managers and natural resource specialists of the coastal Carolinas region to enhance the understanding of drought indicators and to comprehend the indicators' utility for managing coastal natural resources. Eighty-three percent of participants believed that early drought detection was important for their management efforts, yet only 33% were aware of existing drought indicators. Half of the participants stated that drought indicators needed to be specifically focused on a particular kind of habitat, but 90% thought that a single index could be useful for multiple coastal habitats with broad similarities. All participants who stated a current need for an early warning drought indicator (83%) emphasized indicator parameters that reflected both freshwater availability and impacts on ecological resources, but 86% of the participants indicated that they may not have the resources to collect such data. The results revealed common priorities and concerns among coastal resource managers and exposed opportunities to incorporate parameters of shared interest into a drought indicator tailored to the early detection of drought through the inclusion of ecological parameters.

Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) are highly effective at reducing unintended pregnancy, but uptake in Bangladesh is low. Providing information on the most effective methods of contraception increases uptake of more effective methods. This protocol describes a randomised controlled trial of an intervention delivered by mobile phone designed to support post-MR contraceptive use in Bangladesh. Methods: This is a multi-site single blind individual randomised controlled trial. At least 960 women undergoing MR procedures at selected facilities will be recruited after their procedure by female research assistants. Women will be randomised into the control or intervention group with a 1:1 ratio. All participants will receive usual clinic care, including contraceptive counselling and the telephone number of a non-toll-free call centre which provides counselling on MR and contraception. During the 4 months after their MR procedure, intervention participants will be sent 11 recorded interactive voice messages to their mobile phone about contraception with a focus on their chosen method and LARCs. Each message allows the participant to connect directly to the call centre. The intervention is free to the user. The control group will receive no messages delivered by mobile phone. All participants will be asked to complete an in-person questionnaire at recruitment and follow-up questionnaires by telephone at 2 weeks, 4 months and 12 months after their MR. The primary outcome for the trial will be self-reported LARC use 4 months post-MR. Secondary outcomes include LARC use at 2 weeks and 12 months post-MR, use of any effective modern contraceptive method at 2 weeks, 4 months and 12 months post-MR, and contraceptive discontinuation, contraceptive method switching, pregnancy, subsequent MR and experience of violence during the 12 month study period. Discussion: Mobile phones offer a low-cost mechanism for providing individualised support to women with contraception outside of the clinic setting. This study will provide information on the effects of such an intervention among MR clients in Bangladesh.

Structures of MART-1<sub>26/27-35</sub> peptide/HLA-A2 complexes reveal a remarkable disconnect between antigen structural homology and T cell recognition	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						peptide/MHC; crystal structure; cross-reactivity; specificity; Melan-A/MART-1	TUMOR-INFILTRATING LYMPHOCYTES; SELF-PEPTIDE; REACTIVE CTL; RECEPTOR RECOGNITION; MELANOMA PATIENTS; INCREASED IMMUNOGENICITY; IMMUNODOMINANT PEPTIDE; CONFORMATIONAL ENTROPY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES; PERIPHERAL-BLOOD	Small structural changes in peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules often result in large changes in immunogenicity, supporting the notion that T cell receptors are exquisitely sensitive to antigen structure. Yet there are striking examples of TCR recognition of structurally dissimilar ligands. The resulting unpredictability of how T cells will respond to different or modified antigens impacts both our understanding of well as efforts to engineer peptides epitopes and variants derived from the MART-1/Melan-A protein are widely used as clinical vaccines. Two overlapping epitopes spanning amino acid residues 26 through 35 are of particular interest: numerous clinical although only the 27-35 nonamer has been found on the surface of targeted melanoma cells. Here, we show that the 26-35 and 27-35 peptides adopt strikingly different conformations when bound to HLA-A2. Nevertheless, clonally distinct MART-1(26/27-35)-reactive T cells show broad cross-reactivity towards these ligands. Simultaneously, however, many of the cross-reactive T cells remain unable to recognize anchor-modified variants with very subtle structural differences. These dichotomous observations challenge our thinking about how structural information on unligated peptide/MHC complexes should be best used when addressing questions of TCR specificity. Our findings also indicate that caution is warranted in the design of immunotherapeutics based on the MART-1 26/27-35 epitopes, as neither cross-reactivity nor selectivity is predictable based on the analysis of the structures alone.

Settings: Two environments simulated simultaneously: one a major trauma center emergency room (ER) with two patient simulators and several human actors; the other an Emergency Operations Command Center (EOC). Target Audience: Students for this course included: clinicians, scientists, military and intelligence officers, lawyers, administrators, and logistic personnel whose jobs involve planning and executing emergency response plans to WMD/T. Simulation Script: A WMD/T attack in Washington, D.C., has occurred. Clinical students performed in their real life roles in the simulated ER, while nonclinical students did the same in the simulated EOC Six ER casualties with combined WMD/T injuries were presented and treated over 40 minutes. In the EOC, each person was given his or her role title with identification tag. The EOC scenario took cues from the action in the ER via two television (TV) news feeds and telephone calls from other Emergency Operations Assets. Performance Expectations: Students were expected to actively engage in their roles. Student performances were self-evaluated during the debriefing. Debriefing: The two groups were reunited and debriefed utilizing disaster crisis resource management tools. Assessment of Effectiveness: Students answered an 18-point questionnaire to help evaluate the usefulness and acceptance of multimodality patient simulation. Lessons Learned: Large-scale, multimodality patient simulation can be used to train both clinicians and nonclinicians for future events of WMD/T Students accepted the simulation experience and thought that scenario was appropriately realistic, complex, and overwhelming. Difficulties include the extensive man-hours involved in designing and presenting the live simulations. EOC-only sessions could be staged with only a few video cassette recorders, TVs, telephones, and callers. (C) 2004 by Elsevier Inc.

The volume of available social data as well as experimental datasets force recommendation algorithms to scale to many computers. Given that social networks can be modelled as graphs, a distributed graph-oriented support able to exploit computer clusters arises as a necessity. In this work, we propose an architecture, called Lightweight-Massive Graph Processing Architecture, which simplifies the design of graph-based recommendation algorithms on clusters of computers, and a Java implementation for this architecture composed of two parts: Graphly, an API offering operations to access graphs; and jLiME, a framework that supports the distribution of algorithm code and graph data. The motivation behind the creation of this architecture is to allow users to define recommendation algorithms through the API and then customize their execution using job distribution strategies, without modifying the original algorithm. Thus, algorithms can be programmed and evaluated without the burden of thinking about distribution and parallel concerns, while still supporting environment-level tuning of the distributed execution. To validate the proposal, the current implementation of the architecture was tested using a followee recommendation algorithm for Twitter as case study. These experiments illustrate the graph API, quantitatively evaluate different job distribution strategies w.r.t. recommendation time and resource usage, and demonstrate the importance of providing non-invasive tuning for recommendation algorithms.

Integration and Segregation of the Brain Relate to Stability of Performance in Children and Adolescents with Varied Levels of Inattention and Impulsivity	BRAIN CONNECTIVITY			English	Article						ADHD; EEG; graph theory; response time variability; sustained attention	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; RESPONSE-TIME VARIABILITY; INTRA-SUBJECT VARIABILITY; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS; INTERFERENCE CONTROL; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; PARENT RATINGS; FLANKER TASK; ADHD	It is common to find that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) produce more variable responses when performing cognitive tasks. The neural mechanism associated with heightened response time variability (RTV) is not well understood in ADHD nor in typically developing individuals. One potential mechanism that might be associated with increased RTV is functional connectivity of the brain, and specifically inefficient connections. This study examined the relationships among functional connectivity of the brain, RTV, and levels of ADHD symptoms, using a cross-sectional developmental design. Twenty children aged 9-12 years and 49 adolescents aged 15-18 years completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task with flanker interference while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. The Conners 3 questionnaire was used to measure the participants' levels of ADHD symptoms. Parameters reflecting different aspects of RTV were computed using ex-Gaussian and fast Fourier transform techniques. Functional connectivity between 64 electrodes was computed for the task period, and global efficiency reflecting functional integration and modularity reflecting strength of functional segregation were computed. Greater global efficiency in the theta band was associated with decreased RTV. Increased integration during the task may help to combine information more efficiently and produce stable responses. When congruent flankers were present, children with greater modularity in the beta band showed greater tau, which is thought to reflect attentional lapses. This association was not observed when incongruent flankers were present. Brains with increased strength of segregated activity might be more prone to attentional lapses, especially during simpler tasks.

The present study aims to investigate how Vietnamese middle-class household food providers are impacted by food advertising communications, their views of food marketing and the ways they think the government can control food marketing to assist people to consume healthier diets. Methods and Study Design: 810 household food providers participated in the online survey. Frequency counts were calculated using IBM SPSS version 21. Results: Many respondents had been exposed to food marketing; 82.8% had seen food advertising in magazines at least once a month, 65.1% had received free food samples in public places, 68.0% had received food advertising information via email. Many household food providers appeared to support food marketing; 73.3% approved of nutrition education in schools or on television being provided by soft drink or fast food companies, 63.7% supported the marketing of infant formula milk. There were mixed views about what actions the government could implement to control food marketing; 88.2% supported clearer food content on food labels, 84.1% believed that children should learn how to purchase and cook foods at school. Conclusions: A substantial majority of Vietnamese middle-class household food providers appeared unaware of the adverse effects of food marketing. Education and policy leadership in food and nutrition are urgently required.	[Pham, Quynh T.

J	Han, Y; Liu, Y; Wang, HY; Liu, XJ				Han, Ying; Liu, Yuan; Wang, Haoyou; Liu, Xiangjun			The Evolution of <i>Vicia ramuliflora</i> (Fabaceae) at Tetraploid and Diploid Levels Revealed with FISH and RAPD	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENOME EVOLUTION; POLYPLOIDY; DIVERSITY; GENES	Vicia ramuliflora L. is a widely distributed species in Eurasia with high economic value. For past 200 years, it has evolved a tetraploid cytotype and new subspecies at the diploid level. Based on taxonomy, cytogeography and other lines of evidence, previous studies have provided valuable information about the evolution of V. ramuliflora ploidy level, but due to the limited resolution of traditional methods, important questions remain. In this study, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) were used to analyze the evolution of V. ramuliflora at the diploid and tetraploid levels. Our aim was to reveal the genomic constitution and parents of the tetraploid V. ramuliflora and the relationships among diploid V. ramuliflora populations. Our study showed that the tetraploid cytotype of V. ramuliflora at Changbai Mountains (M) has identical 18S and 5S rDNA distribution patterns with the diploid Hengdaohezi population (B) and the diploid Dailing population (H). However, UPGMA clustering, Neighbor-Joining clustering and principal coordinates analysis based on RAPD showed that the tetraploid cytotype (M) has more close relationships with Qianshan diploid population T. Based on our results and the fact that inter specific hybridization among Vicia species is very difficult, we think that the tetraploid V. ramuliflora is an autotetraploid and its genomic origin still needs further study. In addition, our study also found that Qianshan diploid population (T) had evolved distinct new traits compared with other diploid populations, which hints that V. ramuliflora evolved further at diploid level. We suggest that diploid population T be re-classified as a new subspecies.

Despite extensive research on the factors influencing green innovation, few studies have been conducted on the precursors. Based on upper echelons (UE) theory, dynamic capability (DC) theory, "stimulus-organism-response" (SOR) theory, social information processing (SIP) theory and cognitive appraisal (CA) theory of emotion, the study explores how digital leadership (DL) affects RGI and investigates the mediating effects of green organizational identity (GOI) and the moderating effects of digital threat (DT) and technology for social good (TSG), as well as the multiple concurrent causalities that trigger high RGI. Design/methodology/approach - The method of combining structural equation model (SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fs QCA) is adopted in the study. Data from 233 questionnaires were collected at two different time points. Findings - This study's findings indicate that the four dimensions of DL can positively influence RGI and GOI partially mediates between the four dimensions of DL and RGI. DT has a negative moderating effect between DL and GOI, while TSG is positively regulated between them, DT and TSG linkage moderates the partial mediating effect of GOI in DL and RGI. Further, fs QCA is used to analyze the causal complexity of DL dimensions and GOI to RGI and nine effective configuration paths are identified. It is found that the synergy of digital thinking ability (DTA), digital detection ability (DDA), digital social ability (DSA), digital reserve ability (DRA) and GOI is crucial to high RGI. Among them, GOI core appears the most times, indicating that GOI plays a vital role in improving enterprise RGI. Originality/value - This study expands the literature on leadership and innovation by constructing a framework of "DL-GOI-RGI" and exploring the transmission of GOI and the boundary effect of DT and TSG. The study used fs QCA and SEM to better understand the statistical associations and the set relations between the conjunctions and conditions.

DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						alcohol; alcohol policy; films; media	TOBACCO; DRINKING; NORMS; CONSUMPTION; MOVIES	Introduction: Alcohol exposure is common in popular films, and research has demonstrated a link between alcohol exposure and use. The likelihood of implementing specific policies to reduce the amount of film exposure is dependent on the level of public support; however, evidence is currently lacking. This study investigated how supportive people are of film-related alcohol policies and whether providing information about the amount of film exposure increased support.Methods: Australian adults (N = 252) first provided estimates of how much alcohol they thought were in popular films and then were randomised to either see an infographic about the amount of alcohol in films or not. All participants rated how supportive they were of eight policies.Results: The items 'alcoholic beverages and consumption should not be shown in G or PG rated films' (M = 3.54) and 'alcohol should not be glorified in films' (M = 3.49) were rated significantly higher than the scale's midpoint of 3 (p < 0.001). Participants who were older, female or reported lower alcohol use were more supportive of the policies. Only one policy item, 'information about alcohol sponsorship should be provided' received higher support from those who received the infographic compared to those who did not (M = 3.53 vs. M = 3.05; t(250) = -3.09, p = 0.002).Discussion and Conclusion: Participants were relatively supportive of film alcohol policies. However, providing information about the amount of alcohol in films did not make a difference on the level of support for most film alcohol policies.

Case Study of a High-Impact Precipitation Event	WEATHER AND FORECASTING			English	Article						Operational forecasting; Forecasting; Forecasting techniques; Ensembles; Numerical weather prediction/forecasting; Forecast verification/skill	GLOBAL ENSEMBLE; MODEL; SKILL; MESOSCALE; IMPLEMENTATION; PREDICTION; PHYSICS; NCEP; TIME	The proliferation of ensemble forecast system output in recent years motivates this investigation into how operational forecasters utilize convection-permitting ensemble forecast system guidance in the forecast preparation process. A 16-member, convection-permitting ensemble forecast of the high-impact heavy precipitation resulting from Tropical Storm Fay (2008) is conducted and evaluated. The ensemble provides a skillful, albeit underdispersive and bimodal, forecast at all precipitation thresholds considered. A forecasting exercise is conducted to evaluate how forecasters utilize the ensemble forecast system guidance. Forecasters made two storm-total accumulated precipitation forecasts: one before and one after evaluating the ensemble guidance. Concurrently, forecasters were presented with questionnaires designed to gauge their thought processes in preparing each of their forecasts. Exercise participants felt that the high-resolution ensemble guidance added value and confidence to their forecasts, although it did not meaningfully reduce forecast uncertainty. Incorporation of the ensemble guidance into the forecast preparation process resulted in a modest mean improvement in forecast skill, with each forecast found to be skillful at all accumulated precipitation thresholds. Forecasters primarily utilized the ensemble guidance to identify a "most likely" forecast outcome from disparate deterministic guidance solutions and to help quantify the uncertainty associated with the forecast. Forecasters preferred ensemble guidance that enabled them to quickly understand the range of solutions provided by the ensemble, particularly over the entirety of the domain. Forecasters were generally aware of the diversity of solutions provided by the ensemble guidance; however, only a select few actively interrogated this information when revising their forecasts and each did so in different ways.

The need to make health services and research relevant to the general public through user involvement and consultation has been recognized and formalized in guidelines and research publications. Objectives. We had the following objectives (i) to involve and enable lay people to identify and direct a research study as co-researchers consulting members of the general public about their awareness and knowledge of stroke and stroke risk; and (ii) to consult members of the general public aged between 40 and 65 years old to identify what they know about the signs of stroke and potential risk factors in order to inform local public health programmes. Methods. A 20-point multiple choice questionnaire was designed by two consumers trained in research skills at a year long training programme. The questionnaire was sent to 250 randomly selected patients from one general practice in North Staffordshire. Results. A 57% response rate was achieved (142 out of 250), with 139 being appropriate for analysis. The current knowledge and awareness of stroke and stroke risk was relatively good. Almost 90% knew that stroke occurs in the brain and most correctly identified the causes as related to impaired blood supply to the brain. Further, upon recognizing signs of stroke, 96% thought it was 'extremely important' to get immediate treatment for someone who may be having a stroke. Seventy-eight percent of respondents stated that they would like further information about stroke. The most popular sources of information identified were: their general practice (51%); television and radio (36%); and friends and family (33%). Conclusion. The consumers' involvement has essentially allowed lay people to consult other members of the general public about health issues of national priority with specific local relevance. The involvement of consumers in research needs to be considered as worthwhile if it is to have any lasting impact on local or national services. Future research using consumer involvement will need to decide upon the balance between scientific integrity and the level of consumer direction.

Furthermore, according to the social influence theory, the relationship between zhongyong, an essential Confucian orientation mode and voice behavior, and the moderating role of coworker's regulatory focus (promotion focus and prevention focus) has been examined. Design/methodology/approach A field study has been designed to test our hypotheses. We used samples of 291 employee-coworker dyads from a variety of organizations in China to test this study's hypotheses. Findings The results of this empirical study show that zhongyong is positively related to harmony voice. Coworkers' promotion focus strengthens the positive effect of zhongyong on harmony voice, and coworkers' prevention focus weakens the positive effect of zhongyong on harmony voice. Research limitations/implications Traditionally defined voice and harmony voice might cause different risks to the voicer. However, how and what kinds of risks may be differently caused by these two types of voice behaviors have not been examined in this study. Future empirical research can explore the different effects of traditionally defined voice and harmony voice. Practical implications Managers responsible for managing Chinese employees should notice the difference in some important ways of thinking between Easterners and Westerners. Specifically, zhongyong may direct people to express issues related to work in ways that are different from those of their Western counterparts. Harmony voice can benefit the Chinese organization without disrupting organizational development. Social implications By examining the relationship between zhongyong and harmony voice, we contribute to identifying antecedents of voice by using an emic research perspective. Originality/value We made significant theoretical contributions to voice literature. We developed the construct of harmony voice, and we examined the relationship between zhongyong and voice.

Children Consider Informants' Sources When Deciding Whom to Believe	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL			English	Article						social cognition; knowledge; consensus; testimony	KNOWLEDGE; EVALUATE; DISTINGUISH; ENDORSEMENT; RELIABILITY; PERCEPTION; CONFORMITY; INFERENCES; CERTAINTY; TESTIMONY	To successfully navigate the world, we cannot simply accept everything we hear as true. We must think critically about others' testimony, believing only sources who are well-informed and trustworthy. This ability is especially crucial in early childhood, a time when we both learn the most, and have the least prior knowledge we can fall back upon to verify others' claims. While even young children evaluate testimony by considering whether agents' firsthand experiences license their claims, much of the time, our informants do not possess firsthand knowledge. When agents transmit information learned from others (rather than discovered firsthand), can children also evaluate their testimony's social basis? Across 3 experiments (N = 390), we manipulate the number of primary sources originating a claim, and the number of secondary sources repeating it. We find that by age 6, children understand that a claim is only as reliable as its original source, endorsing claims supported by more primary (rather than secondary) sources. While young preschoolers already understand the link between firsthand perceptual access and knowledge, these results suggest that a full understanding of testimony's social basis may be later-developing.

ITC is thought to require protein and ligand solutions of high quality, meaning both the absence of contaminants as well as accurately determined concentrations. Methods: Ligands synthesized to deviating purity and protein of different pureness were titrated by ITC. Data curation was attempted also considering information from analytical techniques to correct stoichiometry. Results and conclusions: We used trypsin and tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT), together with high affinity ligands to investigate the effect of errors in protein concentration as well as the impact of ligand impurities on the apparent thermodynamics. We found that errors in protein concentration did not change the thermodynamic properties obtained significantly. However, most ligand impurities led to pronounced changes in binding enthalpy. If protein binding of the respective impurity is not expected, the actual ligand concentration was corrected for and the thus revised data compared to thermodynamic properties obtained with the respective pure ligand. Even in these cases, we observed differences in binding enthalpy of about 4 kJ . mol(-1), which is considered significant. General significance: Our results indicate that ligand purity is the critical parameter to monitor if accurate thermodynamic data of a protein-ligand complex are to be recorded. Furthermore, artificially changing fitting parameters to obtain a sound interaction stoichiometry in the presence of uncharacterized ligand impurities may lead to thermodynamic parameters significantly deviating from the accurate thermodynamic signature.

A qualitative exploration of the perceptions of potential recipients	SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER			English	Article						Melanoma; Total skin self-examination; Digital technologies; Follow-up	INTERVENTION; MANAGEMENT; ADHERENCE	People with melanoma traditionally attend cancer centre-based follow-up. Most recurrences and new primary melanomas are, however, detected by patients between hospital visits. Despite this, total skin self-examination (TSSE) practices are suboptimal. Digital technologies could be used to support TSSE. The attitudes of potential users are unknown; this study aims to explore the attitudes of people with melanoma towards using digital technologies and the effect of personal characteristics on their attitudes. Twenty-one hospital joint melanoma clinic patients aged 37-83 were purposively recruited. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore patients' views on the use of digital technology during follow-up and identify barriers or facilitators. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subject to framework analysis. Participants had a wide range of IT skills. All used a mobile phone, most had heard of telemedicine and several had used Skype. Participants felt that with thought, tailoring and training, technology could enable self-monitoring as part of melanoma follow-up. Technological benefits included having a co-ordinating nurse specialist, contactable electronically, and having a personalised skin map and tailored information about melanoma. Participants cautioned that technological developments must take account of personal needs and characteristics. Few had security concerns. People are not currently equipped to undertake self-monitoring as part of their melanoma follow-up, but many would be keen to employ technology to support this. A range of technologies could be utilised with potential benefits. Technologies should be carefully designed and individually tailored, considering age, familiarity with technology, place of residence and time since diagnosis.

Perceptions of the safety of oral contraceptives among a predominantly Latina population in Texas	CONTRACEPTION			English	Article						Oral contraceptives; Latina; Misperceptions; Over-the-counter provision	UNITED-STATES; NATIONAL-SURVEY; CONTRAINDICATIONS; DISPARITIES; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; WOMENS	Background: Fear of side effects and previous negative experiences are common reasons for contraceptive nonuse. Study Design: We collected information about perceptions of oral contraceptive (OC) safety from 1271 women 18-49 years old in El Paso, TX, and compared their responses to a medical evaluation by a nurse practitioner. We also asked participants about their interest in obtaining OCs over the counter (OTC). Results: Among 794 women potentially at risk of unintended pregnancy, 56.0% said that OCs were medically safe for them. Reasons given for OCs being unsafe were related to fears of side effects and prior negative experiences rather than true contraindications. Older women and participants recruited at the less affluent recruitment site were significantly more likely to report that OCs were medically unsafe for them (p<.05). Nonusers who thought OCs were medically unsafe for them were as likely to be medically eligible for use as current hormonal users. Among nonusers or nonhormonal users and potential OC candidates (n=601), 60.2% said they would be more likely to use OCs if they were available OTC. Conclusions: Women's perception of OC safety does not correlate well with medical eligibility for use. More education about the safety and health benefits of hormonal contraception is needed. OTC availability might contribute to more positive safety perceptions of OCs compared to a prescription environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Design: Descriptive and cross-sectional survey. Setting: The physical medicine and rehabilitation outpatient clinic of a university hospital in Turkey. Participants: This study was performed from July to December2018. It included 103 patients with spinal cord injuries. Outcome Measures: The data were collected using an introductory information form, the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale and the Golombok Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction. Data were evaluated using the chi-square test, the Mann?Whitney U test, the Kruskal?Wallis test and linear regression. Results: The total mean scores on the Golombok Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction were 40.2???21.6 for males and 44.9???18.1 for females. According to the linear regression analysis, model VII presented the best results of the relationship between physiological and psychological determinants that affect the sexual satisfaction of patients with spinal cord injuries. Model VII consisted of the variables of ASIA A and B scores, age, injury due to falling from height, being a housewife, and thinking of being unable to reach future goals. These explained 75.4% of the variation in sexual satisfaction scores. Conclusion: The participants? mean scores on the Golombok Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction were found to be affected by various variables. A significant relationship between their mean scores on the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale and the Golombok Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction was determined.

Drivers and Consequences of Narrative Transportation: Understanding the Role of Stories and Domain-Specific Skills in Improving Radically New Products	JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							LEAD USERS; STORYTELLING THEORY; CUSTOMER INPUT; KNOWLEDGE; CONSUMERS; INNOVATION; PERFORMANCE; CATEGORIZATION; INFORMATION; INVOLVEMENT	This article investigates the role of transportation in concept tests (i.e., a vivid mental image of a new product concept and the way of using it) for radically new products. Based on transportation literature, the article proposes that concept descriptions in a story format can stimulate transportation. Further, the article builds on the literature on domain-specific skills to propose that technological reflectiveness (i.e., the ability to think about the impact of a technological product on its users and society in general) and product expertise increase transportation. The article explores the effect that transportation has on the ability of consumers to enumerate the advantages and disadvantages of a radically new product and on their ability to provide valuable concept improvement ideas (i.e., ideas that are highly novel, feasible, and beneficial for consumers). A quasi-experiment with 253 participants demonstrates that a story format, product experience with related product categories, and technological reflectiveness increased transportation with regard to radically new products. The empirical research also showed that transportation facilitates the enumeration of the advantages and the disadvantages of a concept, resulting in more valuable concept improvement ideas. These findings suggest that innovation managers should strive to evoke transportation in concept tests for radically new products, as transportation allows consumers to provide more valuable input.

J	Gruber, CW				Gruber, Christian W.			Physiology of invertebrate oxytocin and vasopressin neuropeptides	EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							OXYTOCIN/VASOPRESSIN-SUPERFAMILY PEPTIDES; MOLLUSK LYMNAEA-STAGNALIS; LYS-CONOPRESSIN-G; RED FLOUR BEETLE; PROTEIN HORMONES; EISENIA-FOETIDA; DIURETIC HORMONE; OCTOPUS-VULGARIS; RESEARCH TOOLS; RECEPTOR	Neuropeptides and regulatory peptide hormones control many developmental, physiological and behavioural processes in animals, including humans. The nonapeptides oxytocin and arginine vasopressin are produced and released by the pituitary gland and have actions on many organs and tissues. Receptive cells possess particular receptors to which the peptides bind as ligands, leading to activation of G-protein-coupled receptors, hence cellular responses. In humans and other mammalian species, oxytocin and vasopressin mediate a range of peripheral and central physiological functions that are important for osmoregulation, reproduction, complex social behaviours, memory and learning. The origin of the oxytocin/vasopressin signalling system is thought to date back more than 600 million years. All vertebrate oxytocin- and vasopressin-like peptides have presumably evolved from the ancestral nonapeptide vasotocin by gene duplication and today are present in vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. Oxytocin- and vasopressin-like peptides have been identified in several invertebrate species, including molluscs, annelids, nematodes and arthropods. Members of this peptide family share high sequence similarity, and it is possible that they are functionally related across the entire animal kingdom. However, it is evident that not all animals express oxytocin/vasopressin neuropeptides and that there is little information available about the biology and physiology of this signalling system of invertebrates and, in particular, of insects, which represent more than half of all known living organisms. This report describes the discovery of novel oxytocin- and vasopressin-like peptides in arthropods and summarizes the status quo of the functional relevance of this neuropeptide signalling system in invertebrates, which will have beneficial implications for the design of selective and potent ligands to human oxytocin and vasopressin receptors.

J	Inaida, S; Shobugawa, Y; Matsuno, S; Saito, R; Suzuki, H				Inaida, Shinako; Shobugawa, Yugo; Matsuno, Shigeo; Saito, Reiko; Suzuki, Hiroshi			The South to North Variation of Norovirus Epidemics from 2006-07 to 2008-09 in Japan	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INFECTIOUS-DISEASE SURVEILLANCE; NORWALK-LIKE VIRUSES; AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION; EVOLUTION; ILLNESS; OUTBREAK; HISTORY; WEATHER; ENGLAND; GII/4	Background: Norovirus (NoV) is a major cause of gastroenteritis during the autumn and winter seasons in Japan as well as in other temperate climate regions. Most outbreaks are thought to occur by secondary attacks through person-to-person infection by fecal-oral route. Severe cases are found in young children or patients with chronic diseases. Clarifying the patterns of epidemic diffusion is important for considering effective monitoring and surveillance as well as possible prevention. Methods: We considered the predominant viral genotype from the laboratory result obtained from Infectious Agents Surveillance Report (IASR) of National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID). We investigated the increase of NoV cases nationwide for the 2006-07 to 2008-09 seasons using sentinel gastroenteritis data collected from about 3000 pediatric clinics on National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NESID) acquired from the kriging method in the geographic information system (GIS). Results: During these three seasons, the majority of the detected virus was GII.4, which ranged from 60.4 to 88.9%. The number of cases (per sentinel site) at the peak week was 22.81 in the 2006-07 season and it decreased in the following seasons. NoV cases began to increase earlier in the southern areas and gradually extended into the northern areas, similarly, over the seasons. The average period from when the increase of cases was detected in the southern area to when it reached the northern area was 12.7 weeks. Conclusion: The decrease of the number of sentinel cases at the peak week may suggest the development of herd immunity after a period of high prevalence. Although the NoV epidemic is thought to be associated with cold weather, its cases first increased in the southern area with relatively warm temperature, indicating there are other climate factors involved. Geographic study using the sentinel data could enhance the monitoring and surveillance of and preparedness against epidemics.

The experiences of early adopters may facilitate decision making for hospitals less able to risk their limited resources. This study identifies the costs to design, develop, implement, and operate an innovative informatics-based registry and disease management system (POPMAN) to manage type 2 diabetes in a primary care setting. Methods: The various cost components of POPMAN were systematically identified and collected. Results: POPMAN cost $450,000 to develop and operate over 3.5 years (1999-2003). Approximately $250,000 of these costs are one-time expenditures or sunk costs. Annual operating costs are expected to range from $90,000 to $110,000 translating to approximately $90 per patient for a 1,200 patient registry. Conclusions: The cost of POPMAN is comparable to the costs of other quality-improving interventions for patients with diabetes. Modifications to POPMAN for adaptation to other chronic diseases or to interface with new electronic medical record systems will require additional investment but should not be as high as initial development costs. POPMAN provides a means of tracking progress against negotiated quality targets, allowing hospitals to negotiate pay for performance incentives with insurers that may exceed the annual operating cost of POPMAN. As a result, the quality of care of patients with diabetes through use of POPMAN could be improved at a minimal net cost to hospitals.

To manage this crisis, a fixed shift system was applied to nursing home staff in Turkey to protect nursing home residents from the COVID-19 pandemic. Staff were not allowed to leave the institution during fixed shifts. It is thought that this practice for the COVID-19 outbreak, while protecting nursing home residents on the one hand, increased the workload and related stress of nursing home staff on the other hand. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study examining the workload and stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic for nursing home staff in Turkey. The aim of this study was to examine the level of workload and work stress experienced by staff working in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. Methods: A cross-sectional research design was used in the study. The sample of the study consisted of nursing home personnel working in nursing homes in the provinces of Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir and Antalya between October 2021 and January 2022. A personal information form and a workload and stress scale were used for collecting the data. Cluster analysis was performed with SPSS software. Results: In total, 154 nursing home personnel participated in the study. A statistically significant difference was found between the mean age of the two clusters. The first cluster was described as "old" and the second as "young". Statistically significant and high values were found in the quantitative workload, qualitative workload, job organization, social work area and fatigue factors in the nursing home staff in the older participant cluster.

Differences in the Cellular Uptake and Intracellular Itineraries of Amyloid Beta Proteins 40 and 42: Ramifications for the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery	MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; cellular trafficking; cholesterol; endocytosis; lysosomes; neurodegeneration	INTRANEURONAL A-BETA-42 ACCUMULATION; NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; A-BETA; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; PC12 CELLS; IN-VIVO; DISEASE; NEURONS; BRAIN; MICE	Mounting evidence suggests that the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurofibrillary tangles and parenchymal amyloid plaques, are downstream reflections of neurodegeneration caused by the intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid-beta proteins (A beta), particularly A beta 42 and A beta 40. While the neurotoxicity of more amyloidogenic but less abundant A beta 42 is well documented, the effect of A beta 40 on neurons has been understudied. The A beta 40 expression in the presymptomatic AD brain is ten times greater than that of A beta 42. However, the A beta 40:42 ratio decreases with AD progression and coincides with increased amyloid plaque deposition in the brain. Hence, it is thought that A beta 40 protects neurons from the deleterious effects of A beta 42. The pathophysiological pathways involved in the neuronal uptake of A beta 40 or A beta 42 have not been clearly elucidated. Lack of such critical information obscures therapeutic targets and thwarts rational drug development strategies aimed at preventing neurodegeneration in AD. The current study has shown that fluorescein labeled A beta 42 (F-A beta 42) is internalized by neurons via dynamin dependent endocytosis and is sensitive to membrane cholesterol, whereas the neuronal uptake of F-A beta 40 is energy independent and nonendocytotic. Following their uptake, both F-A beta 40 and F-A beta 42 did not accumulate in early/recycling endosomes; F-A beta 42 but not F-A beta 40 accumulated in late endosomes and in the vesicles harboring caveolin-1. Furthermore, F-A beta 42 demonstrated robust accumulation in the lysosomes and damaged their integrity, whereas F-A beta 40 showed only a sparse lysosomal accumulation. Such regulated trafficking along distinct pathways suggests that A beta 40 and A beta 42 exercise differential effects on neurons. These differences must be carefully considered in the design of a pharmacological agent intended to block the neurodegeneration triggered by A beta proteins.

Scent Chemicals of the Brushtail Possum, <i>Trichosurus vulpecula</i>	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Mammalian chemical signals; Brushtail possum; Trichosurus vulpecula; Invasive vertebrate pest; Cloaca; Fatty acids; Fatty alcohols; Decyl esters; Formate esters; Polysulfides; Alkylglycerol ethers	MAMMALIAN EXOCRINE SECRETIONS; STERNAL GLAND SECRETIONS; VOLATILE CONSTITUENTS; PREORBITAL SECRETION; ANAL GLAND; HOUSE MOUSE; IDENTIFICATION; URINE; COMPONENTS; SEMIOCHEMICALS	The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is the most widespread browsing marsupial in Australia, where it occupies woodland, agricultural, and urban environments. Following its introduction into New Zealand in the 19th century it has become a major feral pest, threatening native forests. The adaptability of the possum is thought to be due in part to its social organization, in which chemical communication is important. Possums have cloacal glands and exhibit related marking behavior. This study sought to characterize the chemicals involved in scent marking. Swabs were taken of the cloacal region of 15 possums (5 females, 10 males) from north-eastern Tasmania and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. There was a large number of compounds present, including 81 branched and unbranched, and saturated and unsaturated, fatty acids (C-4-C-15) and alcohols (C-6-C-26); 27 esters of 2,6- and 2,7-dimethyloctanol; 29 esters of formic acid; 39 sulfur compounds including S-8 and a series of dialkyl disulfides, trisulfides, and tetrasulfides (C-4-C-10); and several alkylglycerol ethers. Many of these cloacal compounds are new to biology. There was considerable individual variability in the relative amounts of compounds found, and no evident sex differences, although the study was not designed to test this. This pattern suggests that these compounds may be acting collectively as a signature mixture of semiochemicals, carrying information on the individual, its kinship, and physiological and social status. This is the first detailed description of putative semiochemicals in any marsupial species.

Children have a limited attention span and research on video/cartoon-based literacy projects has indicated greater efficacy with more retention and engagement. The cartoon based on the theme of anti-bullying was used in a 6-week intervention program in an experimental design setup with 120 experimental and 40 control group students recruited from the Islamabad/Rawal-pindi area (ages 9-11). The behaviours and awareness about the concepts of physical and verbal bullying, coercion and damaging others' property, as well as qualitative information about the cartoon themes were assessed before and after the program for pre- and post-test comparison. The cartoon was accompanied with teaching aids, worksheets and activity-based learning. The results indicated that only 3.3% students were aware about bullying and its various types to begin with and after intervention 98.7% understood the concept clearly. Before the intervention, 65.8% students didn't understand that they were bullies - after the intervention it reduced to 22.5% who thought they were not bullies. Effectiveness of the results from this video literacy program will enable development of more emotional resilience education courses in the curriculum to create a more resilient society in the long run and curb bullying in schools.

Human-inspired Identification of High-level Concepts using OWA and Linguistic Quantifiers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						concept identification; text documents; ontology; hierarchy of concepts; ordered weighted averaging operator; importance of concepts	INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; ONTOLOGY; WEB; CLASSIFICATION	Intelligent agent based system can be used to identify high-level concepts matching sets of keywords provided by users. A new human-inspired approach to concept identification in documents is introduced here. The proposed method takes keywords and builds concept structures based on them. These concept structures are represented as hierarchies of concepts (HofC). The ontology is used to enrich HofCs with terms and other concepts (sub-concepts) based on concept definitions, as well as with related concepts. Additionally, the approach uses levels of importance of terms defining the concepts. The levels of importance of terms are continuously updated based on a flow of documents using an Adaptive Assignment of Term Importance (AATI) schema. The levels of activation of concepts identified in a document that match these in the HofC are estimated using ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators with linguistic quantifiers. A simple case study presented in the paper is designed to illustrate the approach.	[Reformat, M.

Scene Regularity Interacts With Individual Biases to Modulate Perceptual Stability	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						visual perception; bias; bayesian; computational modeling; regularity; psychophysics; human perception; motion perception	MOTION SIGNALS; DOT DENSITY; TOP-DOWN; COMPETITION; COHERENCE; MECHANISMS; TRANSPARENCY; INTEGRATION; REPULSION	Sensory input is inherently ambiguous but our brains achieve remarkable perceptual stability. Prior experience and knowledge of the statistical properties of the world are thought to play a key role in the stabilization process. Individual differences in responses to ambiguous input and biases toward one or the other interpretation could modulate the decision mechanism for perception. However, the role of perceptual bias and its interaction with stimulus spatial properties such as regularity and element density remain to be understood. To this end, we developed novel bi-stable moving visual stimuli in which perception could be parametrically manipulated between two possible mutually exclusive interpretations: transparently or coherently moving. We probed perceptual stability across three composite stimulus element density levels with normal or degraded regularity using a factorial design. We found that increased density led to the amplification of individual biases and consequently to a stabilization of one interpretation over the alternative. This effect was reduced for degraded regularity, demonstrating an interaction between density and regularity. To understand how prior knowledge could be used by the brain in this task, we compared the data with simulations coming from four different hierarchical models of causal inference. These models made different assumptions about the use of prior information by including conditional priors that either facilitated or inhibited motion direction integration. An architecture that included a prior inhibiting motion direction integration consistently outperformed the others. Our results support the hypothesis that direction integration based on sensory likelihoods maybe the default processing mode with conditional priors inhibiting integration employed in order to help motion segmentation and transparency perception.

Estimating cliff retreat in southern California considering sea level rise using a sand balance approach	MARINE GEOLOGY			English	Article						Coastal retreat model; Coastal cliffs; Coastal erosion; California; Sea level rise	SOFT ROCK SHORES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COASTAL CHANGE; EROSION; RECESSION; BEACH; PREDICTION; MODEL; EVOLUTION; IMPACTS	A sand balance coastal profile model for estimating cliff and shoreline retreats considering sea level rise is discussed. The model, specifically designed for cuffed coasts fronted by sandy beaches, conditionally permits beach and cliff retreat to occur independently, and includes subaerial cliff erosion and external beach sand sources. The model accommodates complex nearshore and inland topography, high volume beaches, and variable cliff composition, and is suitable where local sand balance is thought to be a primary controller of coastal evolution over decade-century time scales. Designating an upper active beach boundary and beach-cliff intersection divides the coastal profile into active beach and cliff sections separated by a back beach buffer. The buffer acts as a sand reservoir and delays marine driven cliff erosion, resulting in lower estimated cliff retreat compared to previous models neglecting protective beaches. The model was applied on 21 km of cliffs in Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California considering sea level rise ranging from 0.5 to 2 m over 100 yrs using 207 profiles, sand budget deficits estimated from historical data, and sand inputs from terrestrial erosion estimated from a time series of lidar data. Modeled mean and maximum scenario cliff retreats ranged from 4-87 m and 21-179 m, respectively, and provide order of magnitude estimates, but are reliant on model assumptions and do not include potential coastal changes unrelated to local sand balance. The results underscore the influence of protective beaches on cliff retreat. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Young, A. P.; Flick, R. E.; O'Reilly, W. C.; Helly, J.

Organ- and tissue-specific properties of the circadian clock and shoot-to-root circadian signaling have been reported. While this long-distance signaling is thought to coordinate physiological functions across tissues, little is known about the feedback regulation of the root clock on the shoot clock in the hierarchical circadian network. Here, we show that the plant circadian clock conveys circadian information between shoots and roots through sucrose and K+. We also demonstrate that K+ transport from roots suppresses the variance of period length in shoots and then improves the accuracy of the shoot circadian clock. Sucrose measurements and qPCR showed that root sucrose accumulation was regulated by the circadian clock. Furthermore, root circadian clock genes, including PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR7 (PRR7), were regulated by sucrose, suggesting the involvement of sucrose from the shoot in the regulation of root clock gene expression. Therefore, we performed time-series measurements of xylem sap and micrografting experiments using prr7 mutants and showed that root PRR7 regulates K+ transport and suppresses variance of period length in the shoot. Our modeling analysis supports the idea that root-to-shoot signaling contributes to the precision of the shoot circadian clock. We performed micrografting experiments that illustrated how root PRR7 plays key roles in maintaining the accuracy of shoot circadian rhythms. We thus present a novel directional signaling pathway for circadian information from roots to shoots and propose that plants modulate physiological events in a timely manner through various timekeeping mechanisms.

The views of parents of children with cancer and pediatric physical therapists on a network for continuity and optimal quality of care for children with cancer: KinderOncoNet	SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER			English	Article						Childhood oncology; Care network; Pediatric physiotherapy; Quality of life; Supportive care	CHILDHOOD; SURVIVAL; MODELS	PurposeChildren with cancer require specific therapeutic guidance. Parents prefer physical therapy close to home, while pediatric physical therapists (PPTs) working in the community may lack specific knowledge. The aim of this study is to determine the needs of parents of children with cancer and PPTs to inform the design and development of a care network, named "KinderOncoNet."MethodsWe explored the perspectives and needs of parents of children with cancer and PPTs in the community, and we investigated the added value that KinderOncoNet could offer. We used an iterative process; data collection consisted of (1) gathering information from parents of children with cancer and PPTs through a survey and (2) co-creation sessions with stakeholders.ResultsIn total, 98 parents and 177 PPTs participated in the survey. Parents (97%) and PPTs (93%) indicated that the care network would bring added value. All but one parent stressed the importance of a local PPT being aware of both the condition and the side and late effects of oncological treatment. Moreover, 40% of PPTs thought they do not have sufficient knowledge to provide high-quality therapy and that they would embrace opportunities for education. Through the co-creation sessions, a prototype of the care network was conceptualized.ConclusionKinderOncoNet can contribute to the continuity and quality of physiotherapy care for children with cancer during and after the oncological treatment. Such a network would allow for sharing knowledge, developing skills, and improving accessibility and communication in the Netherlands.	[Kleinlugtenbelt, L. B.; Tissing, W. J.

To manage risks and realize efficiencies, we must understand not only how these systems are physically connected but also how they are institutionally linked. It is important to understand how actors who make planning, management, and policy decisions understand the relationships among components of the systems. Our question is: How do stakeholders involved in food, energy, and water governance in Phoenix, Arizona understand the nexus and what are the implications for integrated nexus governance? We employ a case study design, generate qualitative data through focus groups and interviews, and conduct a content analysis. While stakeholders in the Phoenix area who are actively engaged in food, energy, and water systems governance appreciate the rationale for nexus thinking, they recognize practical limitations to implementing these concepts. Concept maps of nexus interactions provide one view of system interconnections that be used to complement other ways of knowing the nexus, such as physical infrastructure system diagrams or actor-networks. Stakeholders believe nexus governance could be improved through awareness and education, consensus and collaboration, transparency, economic incentives, working across scales, and incremental reforms.

However, a number of studies have reported seemingly conflicting information regarding cancer outcome disparities with respect to rural residence, with some suggesting that the disparity is not present and others providing inconsistent evidence that either urban or rural residence is associated with poorer outcomes. We suggest a simple explanation for these seeming contradictions: namely that rural cancer outcome disparities are related to factors that occur differentially at a local level, such as environmental exposures, lack of access to care or screening, and socioeconomic factors, which differ by type of cancer. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study examining ten cancers treated at the University of Kansas Medical Center from 2011 to 2018, with individuals from either rural or urban residences. We defined urban residences as those in a county with a U.S. Department of Agriculture Urban Influence Code (UIC) of 1 or 2, with all other residences defines a rural. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to create a pseudo-sample balanced for covariates deemed likely to affect the outcomes modeled with cumulative link and weighted Cox-proportional hazards models. Results We found that rural residence is not a simple risk factor but rather appears to play a complex role in cancer outcome disparities. Specifically, rural residence is associated with higher stage at diagnosis and increased survival hazards for colon cancer but decreased risk for lung cancer compared to urban residence. Conclusion Many cancers are affected by unique social and environmental factors that may vary between rural and urban residents, such as access to care, diet, and lifestyle. Our results show that rurality can increase or decrease risk, depending on cancer site, which suggests the need to consider the factors connected to rurality that influence this complex pattern. Thus, we argue that such disparities must be studied at the local level to identify and design appropriate interventions to improve cancer outcomes.

Studies show implementation intentions can produce moderate to large improvements in behavioral goal achievement. Human associative memory mechanisms have been implicated in the processes by which implementation intentions produce effects. On the basis of the adaptive control of thought-rational (ACT-R) theory of cognition, we hypothesized that the strength of implementation intention effect could be manipulated in predictable ways using reminders delivered by a mobile health (mHealth) app. Objective: The aim of this experiment was to manipulate the effects of implementation intentions on daily behavioral goal success in ways predicted by the ACT-R theory concerning mHealth reminder scheduling. Methods: An incomplete factorial design was used in this mHealth study. All participants were asked to choose a healthy behavior goal associated with eat slowly, walking, or eating more vegetables and were asked to set implementation intentions. N=64 adult participants were in the study for 28 days. Participants were stratified by self-efficacy and assigned to one of two reminder conditions: reminders-presented versus reminders-absent. Self-efficacy and reminder conditions were crossed. Nested within the reminders-presented condition was a crossing of frequency of reminders sent (high, low) by distribution of reminders sent (distributed, massed). Participants in the low frequency condition got 7 reminders over 28 days; those in the high frequency condition were sent 14. Participants in the distributed conditions were sent reminders at uniform intervals. Participants in the massed distribution conditions were sent reminders in clusters. Results: There was a significant overall effect of reminders on achieving a daily behavioral goal (coefficient=2.018, standard error [SE]=0.572, odds ratio [OR]=7.52, 95% CI 0.9037-3.2594, P<.001). As predicted by ACT-R, using default theoretical parameters, there was an interaction of reminder frequency by distribution on daily goal success (coefficient=0.7994, SE=0.2215, OR=2.2242, 95% CI 0.3656-1.2341, P<.001). The total number of times a reminder was acknowledged as received by a participant had a marginal effect on daily goal success (coefficient=0.0694, SE=0.0410, OR=1.0717, 95% CI -0.01116 to 0.1505, P=.09), and the time since acknowledging receipt of a reminder was highly significant (coefficient=-0.0490, SE=0.0104, OR=0.9522, 95% CI -0.0700 to -0.2852], P<.001). A dual system ACT-R mathematical model was fit to individuals' daily goal successes and reminder acknowledgments: a goal-striving system dependent on declarative memory plus a habit-forming system that acquires automatic procedures for performance of behavioral goals. Conclusions: Computational cognitive theory such as ACT-R can be used to make precise quantitative predictions concerning daily health behavior goal success in response to implementation intentions and the dosing schedules of reminders.

J	Daams, MN				Daams, Michiel N.			Estimating the allocation of land to business	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ACCURACY ASSESSMENT; RANDOM FOREST; COVER; CLASSIFICATION; GROWTH; CITIES; LOCATION; SCALE; PIXEL; AREA	This paper is uniquely focused on mapping business land in satellite imagery, with the aim to introduce a standardized approach to estimating how much land in an observed area is allocated to business. Business land and control categories of land are defined and operationalized in a straightforward setting of pixel-based classification. The resultant map as well as information from a sample-based quantification of the map's accuracy are used jointly to estimate business land's total area more precisely. In particular, areas where so-called errors of omission are possibly concentrated are accounted for by post-stratifying the map in an extension of recent advances in remote sensing. In specific, a post-stratum is designed to enclose areas where business activity is co-located. This then enhances the area estimation in a spatially explicit way that is informed by urban and regional economic thought and observation. In demonstrating the methodology, a map for the San Francisco Bay Area metropolitan area is obtained at a producer's accuracy of 0.89 (F1-score = 0.84) or 0.82 to 0.94 when sub-selecting reference sample pixels by confidence in class assignment. Overall, the methodological approach is able to infer the allocation of land to business (in km(2) & PLUSMN; 95% C.I.) on a timely and accurate basis. This inter-disciplinary study may offer some fundamental ground for a potentially more refined assessment and understanding of the spatial distribution of production factors as well as the related structure and implications of land use.

Several new psychotherapies have been developed to assist patients (re)gain metacognitive capacity, including Metacognitive Reflection and Insight Therapy (MERIT). The current study investigated the client's subjective experience of psychotherapy, to determine whether service users found MERIT effective and whether these gains align with quantitative findings, which processes they considered responsible for these benefits, in which ways participants found MERIT similar or different from other interventions, and whether they experienced non-desirable factors and outcomes. Design All participants who had participated in a randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of MERIT were offered a structured post-therapy interview by an independent assessor. Fourteen out of 18 (77%) participants, all of whom had completed therapy, responded. Results Most participants (10/14) indicated that they had experienced the therapy as beneficial to their recovery, and in general contributed to their understanding of their own thinking, which maps closely onto the quantitative findings reported elsewhere. They mainly attributed these changes to their own active role in therapy, the intervention letting them vent and self-express, and forming an alliance with the therapist. Conclusions Participants reports of change map closely onto the quantitative findings from the randomized controlled trial. Findings are discussed in the frameworks of the metacognitive model of psychosis and the integrative intersubjective model of psychotherapy for psychosis emphasizing the role of the clients as active agent of change. Practitioner points The use of a systematic, qualitative interview at the conclusion of therapy may yield important information regarding process and outcome. Analysis of the interview revealed that clients' perceptions regarding change within themselves closely maps onto quantitative findings. MERIT may not be the appropriate intervention for all clients; some may prefer a more solution-oriented approach such as CBTp or Metacognition-Oriented Social Skills training. Self-expressing with a trained clinician may be therapeutic in itself.

As CHIP-associated mutations are known to alter the development and function of myeloid cells, we hypothesized that CHIP may also be associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a disease in which brain-resident myeloid cells are thought to have a major role. To perform association tests between CHIP and AD dementia, we analyzed blood DNA sequencing data from 1,362 individuals with AD and 4,368 individuals without AD. Individuals with CHIP had a lower risk of AD dementia (meta-analysis odds ratio (OR) = 0.64, P = 3.8 x 10(-5)), and Mendelian randomization analyses supported a potential causal association. We observed that the same mutations found in blood were also detected in microglia-enriched fraction of the brain in seven of eight CHIP carriers. Single-nucleus chromatin accessibility profiling of brain-derived nuclei in six CHIP carriers revealed that the mutated cells comprised a large proportion of the microglial pool in the samples examined. While additional studies are required to validate the mechanistic findings, these results suggest that CHIP may have a role in attenuating the risk of AD. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) was found to be associated with a protective effect from Alzheimer's disease (AD) in large population-based cohorts.

With the aim of integrating clinical thinking and obtaining epidemiological and biostatistical results in long series of patients who present balance disorders, we have developed a neuro-otological protocol and its corresponding database. This offers answers to the questions of how to assess the patient, how to conduct a clinical interview correctly, and which complementary studies should be requested and how. Results. The information from the protocol is stored and analysed in our database, which was designed in the Epi-Info software application, produced by CDC (NIH, USA), in collaboration with the WHO Global Program on AIDS. The application, which we call ENO-LK, has already been used to store data concerning 1,100 patients whose average age is 54.5 years old and 62.8% of which were females (SD 18, range 4-93). 69.1% were diagnosed as suffering from vertigo, 12.7% displayed instability, 1.9% syncope and 16.3% had other causes (3 7916 psychogenic and 28% disorders affecting the central integrator). Of the 760 patients with vertigo, in 55% it was positional (60% of these were idiopathic benign), 6.3% were sustained (peripheral causes accounted for 74% and a vascular aetiology was predominant in the central causes), 26.6% were recurring and 12.1% otolithic (in this series the vertigos all had a central aetiology). Conclusions. With this application the user has the possibility of obtaining epidemiological and diagnostic conclusions efficiently and effectively, as well as aiding to follow up all patients who present balance disorders.

Evidence indicates that lymphoma diagnosis is often delayed, yet understanding of issues influencing this is incomplete. Aim To explore patients' and their relatives' perceptions of disease-related factors affecting time to diagnosis of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Design and setting Qualitative UK study involving patients with indolent and aggressive lymphomas, and their relatives, from an established population-based cohort in the north of England. Method Semi-structured interviews with 35 patients and 15 of their relatives. Interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed, and qualitative descriptive analysis was undertaken. Results Participant accounts suggest that certain features of lymphoma can impact on patients' and healthcare providers' (HCPs) responses to disease onset. Three characteristics stand out: disease occurrence (rare), manifestation (varied), and investigative options (often inconclusive). Interviewees described how they, and some HCPs, lacked familiarity with lymphoma, seldom considering it a likely explanation for their symptoms. Symptoms reported were highly variable, frequently non-specific, and often initially thought to be associated with various benign, self-limiting causes. Blood tests and other investigations, while frequently able to detect abnormalities, did not reliably indicate malignancy. Interviewees reported the potential for improvements among HCPs in information gathering, communication of uncertainty, and re-presentation advice for non-resolving/progressive health changes. Conclusion This study demonstrates the complex characteristics of lymphoma, perceived by patients as prolonging time to diagnosis, often despite significant effort by themselves, their relatives, and HCPs to expedite this process. The findings also illustrate why simple solutions to delayed diagnosis of lymphoma are lacking.

They regulate a wide array of protein and enzyme targets through their NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase activities. Sirtuins are also thought to mediate the beneficial effects of low-calorie intake to extend longevity in diverse organisms from yeast to mammals. Small molecules mimicking calorie restriction to stimulate sirtuin activity are attractive therapeutics against age-related disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and neurodegeneration. Little is known about one of the mitochondrial sirtuins, SIRT5. SIRT5 has emerged as a critical player in maintaining cardiac health and neuronal viability upon stress and functions as a tumour suppressor in a context-specific manner. Much has been debated about whether SIRT5 has evolved away from being a deacetylase because of its weak catalytic activity, especially in the in vitro testing. We have, for the first time, identified a SIRT5-selective allosteric activator, nicotinamide riboside (NR). It can increase SIRT5 catalytic efficiency with different synthetic peptide substrates. The mechanism of action was further explored using a combination of molecular biology and biochemical strategies. Based on the existing structural biology information, the NR binding site was also mapped out. These activators are powerful chemical probes for the elucidation of cellular regulations and biological functions of SIRT5. The knowledge gained in this study can be used to guide the design and synthesis of more potent, isotype-selective SIRT5 activators and to develop them into therapeutics for metabolic disorders and age-related diseases.

The Period of PURPLE Crying (POPC) is designed to educate parents about normal infant crying, strategies to use when infants cry and the dangers of shaking in an effort to decrease AHT. Studies evaluating the POPC have measured changes in parent knowledge and behaviour regarding infant crying. Our objective was to evaluate the POPC's effect on caregiver frustration with infant crying compared to standard discharge information (SDI). We taught paediatric interns and medical students rotating in the newborn nursery to deliver the POPC and discuss infant crying. New parents were pseudo-randomised to receive SDI or the POPC plus SDI. Parents were contacted five-to-eight weeks after discharge and asked knowledge questions about infant crying as well as the number of times that they were frustrated by their infant's crying in the preceding week. Of 271 parents who consented to participate, 164 (61%) completed the survey. The POPC group answered two of the knowledge questions correctly more often than the control group (score differences: 17%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3-32% and 21%, 95% CI 7-36%). However, parents reported frustration due to infant crying at similar rates between the control (55/80, 69%) and POPC (60/84, 71%) groups. Our results support previous findings that the POPC improves caregiver knowledge concerning infant crying. The POPC does not appear to affect caregiver frustration with crying. 'Our objective was to evaluate the POPC's effect on caregiver frustration with infant crying compared to standard discharge information' Key Practitioner Messages Instructing new parents about normal infant crying and the dangers of shaking an infant remains an important part of anticipatory guidance. The POPC is not more effective at reducing caregiver frustration with infant crying than standard discharge instructions. Future investigations should specifically aim to include male caregivers as recipients of the programme.	[Groisberg, Shaina] RWJ Barnabas Hlth, Div Child Abuse Pediat, Newark, NJ USA; [Hashmi, S.

Opinions of clinical veterinarians at a US veterinary teaching hospital regarding antimicrobial use and antimicrobial-resistant infections	JAVMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article							PRESCRIBING PATTERNS; GUIDELINES; IMPACT; DOGS	Objective-To determine opinions of faculty members with clinical appointments, clinical veterinarians, residents, and interns at a US veterinary teaching hospital regarding antimicrobial use and antimicrobial-resistant infections. Design-Cross-sectional survey. Sample-71 veterinarians. Procedures-An online questionnaire was sent to all veterinarians with clinical service responsibilities at the North Carolina State University veterinary teaching hospital (n = 167). The survey included 23 questions regarding demographic information, educational experiences, current prescribing practices, and personal opinions related to antimicrobial selection, antimicrobial use, restrictions on antimicrobial use, and antimicrobial resistance. Results-Of the 167 veterinarians eligible to participate, 71 (43%) responded. When respondents were asked to rate their level of concern (very concerned = 1; not concerned = 5) about antimicrobial-resistant infections, most (41/70 [59%]) assigned a score of 1, with mean score for all respondents being 1.5. Most survey participants rated their immediate colleagues (mean score, 1.9) as more concerned than other veterinary medical professionals (mean score, 2.3) and their clients (mean score, 3.4). Fifty-nine of 67 (88%) respondents felt that antimicrobials were overprescribed at the hospital, and 32 of 69 (46%) respondents felt uncomfortable prescribing at least one class of antimicrobials (eg, carbapenems or glycopeptides) because of public health concerns. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Findings indicated that veterinarians at this teaching hospital were concerned about antimicrobial resistance, thought antimicrobials were overprescribed, and supported restricting use of certain antimicrobial classes in companion animals. Findings may be useful in educating future veterinarians and altering prescribing habits and antimicrobial distribution systems in veterinary hospitals.

J	Han, XK; Gao, Y; Wang, SJ; Chen, Q				Han, Xuke; Gao, Yang; Wang, Shengju; Chen, Qiu			Effect of electroacupuncture on diabetic neurogenic bladder A randomized controlled trial protocol	MEDICINE			English	Article						acupuncture; diabetic neurogenic bladder; protocol; randomized controlled trial; urodynamic tests	STRESS URINARY-INCONTINENCE; WOMEN; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ACUPUNCTURE; EFFICACY	Background: The most common and bothersome lower urinary tract complication of diabetes mellitus is diabetic neurogenic bladder (DNB). Acupuncture has certain advantages in treating bladder dysfunction including urinary retention and incontinence. Therefore, we think that electroacupuncture (EA) may be beneficial to DNB patients. However, it is not clear whether EA combined with basic western medicine could optimize the therapeutic effect for DNB. Method/design: This is a sham-controlled, patient-blinded, pioneer randomized controlled trial (RCT). One hundred fifty eligible patients will be randomly divided into 3 groups: A. basic western medicine (BWC), B. EA with BWC, C. sham EA with BWC. EA treatment will be given twice a week for 12 weeks at bilateral BL23, BL32, BL33, and BL35. The BWC group will received Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and methylcobalamin (MC) treatment for 12 weeks, 2 treatment sessions per week. The primary outcome is scored by the 72-hour bladder diary (72h-BD). The secondary outcomes will be scored by the American Urological Association symptom index (AUA-SI), Post-void residual urine volume (PVR) and urodynamic tests. All the assessments will be conducted at baseline and the 12th weeks after the intervention starts. The follow-up assessments will be performed with 72h-BD and AUA-SI in the 4th, 12th, and 24th weeks after intervention ends. Discussion: This trial protocol provides an example of the clinical application acupuncture treatment in the management of DNB. This RCT will provide us information on the effect of treating DNB patients with only acupuncture, western medicine therapy (ALA + MC) as well as the combination of both. The additive effect or synergistic effect of acupuncture and basic western medicine will then be analyzed.

Knowledge mobilization to spread awareness of the 'F-words' in childhood disability: lessons from a family-researcher partnership	CHILD CARE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						childhood disability; family; ICF; knowledge mobilization; multimedia	TRANSLATION	Background In 2012, two CanChild researchers published an article in Child: Care, Health and Development titled 'The "F-words" in childhood disability:I swear this is how we should think!' Building on the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework, the article featured key strengths-based ICF themes (i.e. the 'F-words' Function, Family, Fitness, Fun, Friends and Future). This paper reports on a knowledge mobilization initiative designed to spread awareness of the 'F-words' ideas. Methods Families and researchers collaborated to develop, disseminate and evaluate an online awareness video. The video used written descriptions, parents' reflections and their pictures, music and graphics to captivate the audience. Posted on the CanChild website in May 2014, information about the video was distributed via various dissemination strategies and evaluated by tracking its views and through an online survey. Results After a 2-month evaluation, there were 715 views and 137 survey responses. Of the survey responses, 89% lived in Canada, 55% had not previously heard of the 'F-words; 98% 'extremely liked'/'liked the ideas' and 88% indicated they would share the video. Conclusions By creating a short and captivating video, we were able to spread awareness to a wide audience in a short period of time Engaging families throughout the project was critical to the success of the video. By working together, we hope to continue bridging research and practice and moving the 'F-words' concepts forward one 'word' at a time.

Several studies indicate that nurses seem to be insufficiently informed about pressure ulcer preventive activities. There is, however, no information available about the reasons why nurses seem to be insufficiently informed. Aims and objectives. This study was planned to elucidate the views and beliefs of health care workers (especially enrolled nurses) in Dutch nursing homes about pressure ulcer prevention and about issues related with pressure ulcer prevention. Design. A qualitative study with semi-structured, tape-recorded interviews. Method. Interviews were conducted with enrolled nurses, team leaders, head nurses, staff nurses and physicians. The interviews were coded and analysed. Results. Analysis of the interviews revealed that today's pressure ulcer preventive activities are very much based on old traditions in nursing. It also showed that enrolled nurses have no intention to change the care they deliver with regard to pressure ulcer prevention. Conclusions. It is concluded that a systematic approach is necessary to change nursing thinking and acting with regard to pressure ulcer prevention. Relevance to clinical practice.This study gives an overview of the views and beliefs of health care workers (especially enrolled nurses) in Dutch nursing homes about pressure ulcer prevention. These views and beliefs can be used as a starting point for effective implementation of guidelines regarding the prevention of pressure ulcers.

We screened 52 sheep breeds from the Eurasian subcontinent with 20 microsatellite markers. By estimating and weighting differently within-and between-breed genetic variation our aims were to identify genetic diversity hotspots and prioritize the importance of each breed for conservation, respectively. In addition we estimated how important within-species diversity hotspots are in livestock conservation. Results: Bayesian clustering analysis revealed three genetic clusters, termed Nordic, Composite and Fat-tailed. Southern breeds from close to the region of sheep domestication were more variable, but less genetically differentiated compared with more northern populations. Decreasing weight for within-breed diversity component led to very high representation of genetic clusters or regions containing more diverged breeds, but did not increase phenotypic diversity among the high ranked breeds. Sampling populations throughout 14 regional groups was suggested for maximized total genetic diversity. Conclusions: During initial steps of establishing a livestock conservation program populations from the diversity hot-spot area are the most important ones, but for the full design our results suggested that approximately equal population presentation across environments should be considered. Even in this case, higher per population emphasis in areas of high diversity is appropriate. The analysis was based on neutral data, but we have no reason to think the general trend is limited to this type of data. However, a comprehensive valuation of populations should balance production systems, phenotypic traits and available genetic information, and include consideration of probability of success.

Impact of Effortful Word Recognition on Supportive Neural Systems Measured by Alpha and Theta Power	EAR AND HEARING			English	Article						Alpha power; EEG; Effortful listening; Theta power; Word recognition	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; VERBAL WORKING-MEMORY; LISTENING EFFORT; SPEECH; DYNAMICS; EEG; NOISE; SIGNAL; BRAIN; TASK	Objectives: The goal of this study was to use theta and alpha electroencephalography (EEG) frequency power and self-report measures to examine performance monitoring, cognitive inhibition, and perceived effort required for speech understanding in noise. It was hypothesized that with a linear increase in word recognition task difficulty, there would be a linear increase in listening effort and word recognition performance would decrease in the challenging conditions. In addition, theta and alpha power would have an inverted U-shape across easy to challenging listening conditions. The inverted U-shape would reflect the neural underpinnings of listening effort that cannot be measured by task performance alone. Design: EEG data were collected in 34 normal-hearing adults (18 to 33 years old) during the Words-In-Noise (WIN) test, which was presented in sound field. EEG frequency data were averaged and analyzed at three frontal channels for theta power (4 to 8 Hz), which is thought to reflect performance monitoring, and three parietal channels for alpha power (8 to 12 Hz), which is thought to reflect cognitive inhibition. A ten-point visual analog scale was administered after each WIN signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) condition to capture self-reported required and invested listening effort (RLE and ILE, respectively). The WIN SNR conditions were presented in descending and random order. Results: The SNR presentation (descending or random SNR) had a null effect on word recognition performance; however, presentation did have an effect on theta power, alpha power, and ILE. When controlling for presentation, there were significant effects of SNR and presentation on both theta and alpha frequency power. Theta and alpha power had an inverted U-shape as a function of SNR from easy to challenging, with peak power in the moderate SNR conditions. RLE and ILE both significantly increased as task difficulty increased as expected; however, RLE showed a stronger relation to task performance than ILE. Alpha power was a significant predictor of RLE, ILE, and WIN performance when controlling for SNR. Conclusions: The elevated theta and alpha power in the easy to moderate SNRs and alpha power predicting self-reported listening effort suggest the activation of supportive neural systems during word recognition that could be considered a marker of listening effort. Moreover, the measures of neural support systems and listening effort were independent from task performance, which is a key element to further understanding the neural bases for listening effort. In the context of the broader literature, these results are consistent with (1) a parietal alpha role in supporting inhibitory control to suppress irrelevant information and (2) a frontal theta role in supporting performance monitoring in difficult listening conditions where speech recognition is feasible.

There is a considerable dearth of information regarding the function of IGFBPs in skeletal muscle, particularly their role in the pathophysiology of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In this study we tested the hypothesis that intramuscular IGFBP-2 overexpression would ameliorate the pathology in mdx dystrophic mice. Design: 4 week old male C57BI/10 and mdx mice received a single intramuscular injection of AAV6-empty or AAV6-IGFBP-2 vector into the tibialis anterior muscle. At 8 weeks post-injection the effect of IGFBP-2 overexpression on the structure and function of the injected muscle was assessed. Results: AAV6-mediated IGFBP-2 overexpression in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of 4-week-old C57BL/10 and mdx mice reduced the mass of injected muscle after 8 weeks, inducing a slower muscle phenotype in C57BL/10 but not mdx mice. Analysis of inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression revealed no changes between control and IGFBP-2 injected muscles in dystrophic (mdx) mice. Conclusions: Together these results indicate that the IGFBP-2-induced promotion of a slower muscle phenotype is impaired in muscles of dystrophin-deficient mdx mice, which contributes to the inability of IGFBP-2 to ameliorate the dystrophic pathology. The findings implicate the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) in the signaling required for this adaptation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While there is information regarding what these beliefs correlate with (e.g., cognitive biases, personality styles), there is little information regarding the causal direction between these beliefs and their correlates. To investigate the formation of beliefs, we use an experimental design, in which PBs and belief-associated cognitive biases are assessed before and after a central event: a magic performance (see also Mohr et al., 2018). In the current paper, we report a series of studies investigating the "paranormal potential" of magic performances (Study 1, N = 49; Study 2, N = 89; Study 3, N = 123). We investigated (i) which magic performances resulted in paranormal explanations, and (ii) whether PBs and a belief-associated cognitive bias (i.e., repetition avoidance) became enhanced after the performance. Repetition avoidance was assessed using a random number generation task. After the performance, participants rated to what extent the magic performance could be explained in psychic (paranormal), conjuring, or religious terms. We found that conjuring explanations were negatively associated with religious and psychic explanations, whereas religious and psychic explanations were positively associated. Enhanced repetition avoidance correlated with higher PBs ahead of the performance. We also observed a significant increase in psychic explanations and a drop in conjuring explanations when performances involved powerful psychic routines (e.g., the performer contacted the dead). While the experimentally induced enhancement of psychic explanations is promising, future studies should account for potential variables that might explain absent framing and before-after effects (e.g., emotion, attention). Such effects are essential to understand the formation and manipulation of belief.

Exploring public perspectives on e-health: findings from two citizen juries	HEALTH EXPECTATIONS			English	Article						citizen juries; e-health; lay participation	GENERAL-PRACTITIONERS; IMPLEMENTATION; TELEMEDICINE; PRIORITIES; ENGAGEMENT	Background Interest and investment in e-health continue to grow world-wide, but there remains relatively little engagement with the public on this subject, despite calls for more public involvement in health-care planning. Design This study used two modified citizen juries to explore barriers and facilitators to e-health implementation and the priorities for future e-health research from the perspective of health service users and lay representatives. Citizen juries bring together a group of people to deliberate over a specific issue. They are given information and invited to e-cross-examine witnesses during the process. Results Jurors were very keen for lay views to be included in e-health development and embraced the citizen jury approach. They agreed unanimously that e-health should be developed and thought it was in many ways inevitable. Although there was much enthusiasm for a health-care system which offered e-health as an option, there was as much concern about what it might mean for patients if implemented inappropriately. E-health was preferred as an enhancement rather than substitute for, existing services. Lack of universal access was seen as a potential barrier to implementation but problems such as lack of computer literacy were seen as a temporary issue. Participants emphasized that e-health research needed to demonstrate both clinical and economic benefits. Conclusion There was broad support from the citizen juries for the development of e-health, although participants stressed that e-health should enhance, rather than substitute, face-to-face services. Oneday citizen juries proved a practical method of public engagement on this subject.

J	Zhang, QY; Cao, M; Doll, W				Zhang, Qingyu; Cao, Mei; Doll, William			Fuzzy front end of innovation: a dual theoretical rationale	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING			English	Article						New product development; Environmental uncertainty; Fuzzy front end; Equivocality; Team vision	PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; IMPACT; FRAMEWORK; KNOWLEDGE	Purpose The uncertainties, ambiguities and unknown issues that characterize the beginning of a new product development project have led practitioners and scholars to coin the term fuzzy front end to refer to this seminal stage. The causes of many product failures can be traced back to this fuzzy front end. Despite a growing realization of its importance, the meaning of the term front-end fuzziness itself remains vague. A theory-based framework is not available to guide thinking and research on this important topic. The purpose of this paper is to create a conceptual framework for fuzzy front end. Design/methodology/approach This paper applies Daft and Lengel's (1986) theory of organizational information processing to create a framework for research on the fuzzy front end of product innovation. This framework is used to clarify the concept of front-end fuzziness and identify three sources of fuzziness in the project team's task environment. Findings Contrary to the current literature, the authors argue that equivocality rather than uncertainty is the dominant cause of front-end fuzziness. This new conceptualization: appropriately broadens the concept of front-end fuzziness; identifies new problem areas; highlights the need for new solutions; and suggests the need to focus on team vision as a front-end deliverable. Practical implications The previous literature used a single uncertainty reduction rationale for integrative mechanisms. Thus, it did not consider that the implementation might change from front end to downstream. The dual theoretical rationale suggests that integrative mechanisms can be implemented differently to focus either on uncertainty or equivocality reduction. In the front end, equivocality is the dominant issue and mechanisms should be implemented in ways that create a rich channel to identify issues and share perspectives. In downstream activities where the dominant issue is uncertainty reduction, mechanisms might be implemented in ways that provide greater quantities of information on known issues. Originality/value This new conceptualization of front-end fuzziness provides a better theoretical rationale for how integrative mechanisms enable a project team to work through the fuzziness it faces, creating a clear team vision that guides its downstream efforts.

J	Yan, BJ; Su, XL; Xu, BY; Qiao, X; Wang, LH				Yan, Bingjuan; Su, Xiaole; Xu, Boyang; Qiao, Xi; Wang, Lihua			Effect of diet protein restriction on progression of chronic kidney disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Review							GLOMERULAR-FILTRATION-RATE; TERM-FOLLOW-UP; RENAL-FAILURE; DIABETIC-NEPHROPATHY; MORTALITY; ALBUMINURIA; ASSOCIATION; PREVALENCE; PHOSPHORUS; MANAGEMENT	Background Dietary protein restriction has long been thought to play an important role in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, the effect of dietary protein on the rate of decline in kidney function remains controversial. Objective We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the influence of protein restriction on chronic kidney disease. Method Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946 to March 5, 2016), EMBASE (from 1966 to March 5, 2016), and the Cochrane Library (Inception to March 5, 2016) were searched to identify RCTs comparing different levels of protein intake for at least 24 weeks in adult patients with CKD. The outcomes included kidney failure events, the rate of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) per year, all cause death events, and changes in proteinuria, serum phosphorus concentration, serum albumin, and body mass index (BMI). Results Nineteen trials with 2492 subjects were analyzed. A low protein diet reduced the risk of kidney failure (odds ratio (OR) = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.85) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.96), but did not produce a clear beneficial effect for all cause death events (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.67 to 2.06). The change in the mean difference (MD) for the rate of decline in the eGFR was significant (MD: -1.85, P = 0.001), and for proteinuria (MD: -0.44, P = 0.02). A low protein diet also reduced the serum phosphorus concentration (MD: -0.37, 95% CI: -0.5 to -0.24) and BMI (MD: -0.61, 95% CI: -1.05 to -0.17). However the change in albumin presented no significant difference between two groups (MD: 0.23, 95% CI: -0.51 to 0.97). Conclusions Based on the findings of our meta-analysis, protein-restricted diet may reduce the rate of decline in renal function and the risk of kidney failure for CKD populations, but did not produce a clear beneficial effect for all cause death events. Besides However, the optimal level of protein intake in different participants is left unanswered, and the nutritional status should be regarded with caution.

FTO is linked to energy homeostasis via amino acid sensing and is thought to activate the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, a negative regulator of autophagy. FTO localises both to the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and in this study we identify a functional nuclear localisation signal (NLS) in the N-terminus of FTO, as well as nuclear localization information in its very C-terminus. Inhibition of FTO nuclear transport has no effect on autophagy and in contrast to a previously proposed role of FTO in autophagy, we find no difference in starvation-induced autophagy in control cells compared to a panel of cell types depleted of FTO. Future studies that further characterise the cellular functions of FTO will be important to understand why variants in FTO are associated with body weight.

Based on interferograms, it is possible to infer several information about the observed areas. Two main problems affecting the interferogram can limit its application: phase noise and phase wrapping. In this article, the attention is focused on the first issue. Several algorithms have been developed for interferogram restoration. Given the widespread of deep learning (DL) in the framework of image processing, DL-based algorithms have been proposed for interferogram denoising. Most of the efforts have been devoted to designing specific network architectures or training datasets, rather than to the definition of a specific cost function, well suited for the problem under investigation. The aim of this article is to define a new multiobjective cost function, specifically thought for the interferograms restoration problem: the idea is to provide a cost function able to take into account multiple aspects of the data under investigation (i.e., multiobjective). The cost function is implemented within a convolutional neural network and a specific realistic training dataset is built, to account for the main characteristics of real interferograms. The final outcome of this article is the proposal of a new robust and accurate interferometric phase denoising algorithm (namely, InSAR-MONet), able to remove undesired noise and, at the same time, able to preserve important phase details. The assessment of the method is conducted on simulated and real datasets, comparing quantitatively and qualitatively InSAR-MONet with the state-of-the-art interferometric denoising algorithms.

Intrinsic functional connectivity of the default mode and cognitive control networks relate to change in behavioral performance over two years	CORTEX			English	Article						Intrinsic connectivity; Default mode network; Cognitive control network; Resting state; Longitudinal	RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; SCALE BRAIN NETWORKS; WORKING-MEMORY; ANGULAR GYRUS; CONNECTOME; PATTERNS; PARIETAL; COMMON; TASKS	Understanding how brain circuitry mediates cognitive control of behavior is crucial for understanding both mental health and disease. Cognitive control describes the group of behaviors that guide goal-directed action such as sustaining attention, processing information and inhibiting impulsive responses. We rely on these behaviors for daily social, occupational and emotional functioning. Two brain networks, the cognitive control network (CCN) and default mode network (DMN), are thought to cooperate in an inverse relationship to support these functions. However, we do not yet know how connectivity within and between these networks directly relates to healthy cognitive control behaviors, and whether these interactions change over time. Here, we employed a longitudinal design to investigate if change in intrinsic connectivity in these networks will correlate with change in a range of cognitive control functions. Over two years, 109 healthy individuals, aged eight to thirty-eight, were tested twice using fMRI to assess intrinsic functional connectivity of the CCN and DMN and a validated cognitive battery. We found that increased within- network connectivity through central and left DMN was associated with increased memory performance. Additionally, decreased connectivity between posterior parietal CCN and DMN nodes and decreased connectivity between left and right dorsolateral prefrontal nodes was associated with increased cognitive performance. These findings were age and gender controlled, suggesting that age-independent plastic change in intrinsic connectivity through these networks directly relate to changing behavior. This has implications for targeting intrinsic connectivity as a possible mechanism to improve cognitive function. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Predicted and user perceived heat strain using the ClimApp mobile tool for individualized alert and advice	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Heat strain; Mobile application; Thermal indices; Thermal models	HEALTH; THERMOREGULATION; TEMPERATURE; EVENTS; STRESS; IMPACT; AGE	Thermal models and indices integrated into a mobile application could provide relevant information regarding thermal stress and strain to the general public. The aim of the current paper is to validate such a mobile application, ClimApp, to the users needs in the heat. ClimApp combines weather data with personal user data, thermal models and indices to estimate the thermal strain of the user. The output of ClimApp ranges from -4 to +4, where values below 0 indicate cold strain and values above 0 indicate heat strain. 134 Participants filled in the required personal settings into the app, and indicated if the estimated thermal strain by ClimApp matched their thermal perception. 45 of the participants filled in a user satisfaction questionnaire. Results show that ClimApp is able to predict the heat strain of the user, but may underestimate perceived heat strain when ambient temperature increases. Furthermore, participants were positive about the user-friendliness of ClimApp, but did not think they would use ClimApp frequently and believed the information was irrelevant for them. This is quite remarkable as the number of heat illness cases are increasing and the negative effects of heat occur in all populations exposing themselves to the heat. There needs to be more focus on making people aware of the negative health risks of the heat. ClimApp could play a role as a tool to make heat warnings more accessible for everyone and make people aware of appropriate behavior during periods with high ambient temperatures.	[Folkerts, M.

J	Lang, XJ; Feng, ZQ; Yang, XH; Xu, T				Lang, Xujie; Feng, Zhiquan; Yang, Xiaohui; Xu, Tao			MES: A Helping Elderly Escort Interactive System Based on Reverse Active Integration of Multimodal Intentions	SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING			English	Article								Lacking human-computer collaborative capability is one of the key problems commonly faced by the existing escort robots. To this end, a helping elderly escort interactive system based on reverse active integration of multimodal intentions (MES) is proposed in this paper in response to the elderly's decline in language expression ability, memory, and other abilities. This system can understand the intention of the elderly based on scene perception and three-modal information: speech, gesture, and posture. In detail, the system can extract the interactive intention from the nondeterministic multimodal data input by the elderly and evaluate the trust degree of the extracted intention. The evaluation of intention trust degree is such a process that the system autonomously judges the feasibility of the elderly's intention and corrects the wrong intention expressed by the elderly due to memory decline by reverse thinking of "find reasons based on the results"; when the intention cannot be extracted, the system will take the initiative to ask the elderly for enhanced information conducive to the intention extraction, so as to quickly and correctly extract the interactive intention of the elderly. This design aims at improving the quality of elderly care, making the interaction between the elderly and the robot more natural, improving the accuracy in intention extraction from fuzzy expression, as well as breaking the traditional "master-slave" human-computer interaction and improving the harmony of human-computer interaction. Further, the implementation principle of the system is detailed, and the system is evaluated in this paper. The evaluation experiment was conducted by a robot Pepper embedded with the system. Through experiments, it is verified that Pepper can quickly and accurately get the real intention of the elderly in the interaction with the elderly. In a challenging environment (such as the unclear expression of the elderly), it can still correctly extract the real intention of the elderly with an accuracy of 97% and can effectively avoid the wrong intention expressed by the elderly. This puts forward a valuable research path for the challenge in human-computer collaborative interaction.

J	Oppici, L; Frith, E; Rudd, J				Oppici, Luca; Frith, Emily; Rudd, James			A Perspective on Implementing Movement Sonification to Influence Movement (and Eventually Cognitive) Creativity	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						creative cognition; embodied cognition; exercise-cognition; affordance; functional similarity; education; creative	MOTOR; PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; SPORT	Creativity represents an important feature in a variety of daily-life and domain-specific contexts. Recent evidence indicates that physical movement serves as a key resource for exploring and generating task-relevant creative ideas, supporting the embodied perspective on creative cognition. An intuitive link between movement and creative cognition is movement creativity. The process of exploring the movement solutions an environment offers (i.e., affordances) and exploiting novel, functional, and creative movements may translate to and improve how individuals explore and generate novel ideas. Opening perception to the variety of affordances ("conventional" and novel) an environment offers drives creative movement. Teachers and coaches can promote this process by designing a learning environment that invites performers to consider and utilize novel movement solutions. In this article, we present a rationale for using movement sonification to promote creative movement. Movement sonification consists of mapping a movement parameter into sound, with a sound being triggered or changing according to how movement unfolds. We argue that movement sonification can facilitate the emergence of creative movementviaenhancing perception of currently performed movements and invite performers to utilize novel affordances, and emphasizing information for regulating subsequent creative actions. We exemplify this concept in a creative dance intervention for children during physical education classes. In conclusion, we contend that learning to explore original dance sequences using movement sonification may provide a meaningful link between creative movement and creative cognition. Children may use their mindsandbodies as tools for creative thinking and exploration, such as shaping letters with their bodies.

NOV.; MEROMICTIC LAKE; SULFUROSPIRILLUM-DELEYIANUM; FE(III) REDUCTION; FERRIC IRON; BACTERIA; OCEAN; OXIDATION	Both iron-and sulfur-reducing bacteria strongly impact the mineralogy of iron, but their activity has long been thought to be spatially and temporally segregated based on the higher thermodynamic yields of iron over sulfate reduction. However, recent evidence suggests that sulfur cycling can predominate even under ferruginous conditions. In this study, we investigated the potential for bacterial iron and sulfur metabolisms in the iron-rich (1.2 mM dissolved Fe2+), sulfate-poor (< 20 mu M) Lake Pavin which is expected to host large populations of iron-reducing and iron-oxidizing microorganisms influencing the mineralogy of iron precipitates in its permanently anoxic bottom waters and sediments. 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries from at and below the oxycline revealed that highly diverse populations of sulfur/sulfate-reducing (SRB) and sulfur/sulfide-oxidizing bacteria represented up to 10% and 5% of the total recovered sequences in situ, respectively, which together was roughly equivalent to the fraction of putative iron cycling bacteria. In enrichment cultures amended with key iron phases identified in situ (ferric iron phosphate, ferrihydrite) or with soluble iron (Fe2+), SRB were the most competitive microorganisms, both in the presence and absence of added sulfate. The large fraction of Sulfurospirillum, which are known to reduce thiosulfate and sulfur but not sulfate, present in all cultures was likely supported by Fe(III)-driven sulfide oxidation. These results support the hypothesis that an active cryptic sulfur cycle interacts with iron cycling in the lake. Analyses of mineral phases showed that ferric phosphate in cultures dominated by SRB was transformed to vivianite with concomitant precipitation of iron sulfides. As colloidal FeS and vivianite have been reported in the monimolimnion, we suggest that SRB along with iron-reducing bacteria strongly influence iron mineralogy in the water column and sediments of Lake Pavin.

The task demand of the LFT is considered to vary across languages, as the cognitive process largely relies on sound and writing systems. Specifically, a sound unit for a letter (s) and a manner of association between them are assumed to be related with the performance. In the current study, three analyses have been conducted to examine this issue, using Japanese, Turkish, and English-speaking patients with schizophrenia. It was hypothesized that severity of letter fluency impairment would be in the order of Japanese, Turkish, and English speaking patients according to the inflexibility of a word search. First, performance on the LFT and the CFT was compared among Japanese (N = 40), Turkish (N = 30), and the US (N = 31) patients (Analysis 1). A significant difference was found between the US and other two groups only in the LFT. Second, verbal fluency performance was compared between Japanese and Turkish patients by contrasting the degree of disassociations from normal controls (Japanese: N = 20, Turkish: N = 30) (Analysis 2). In Japanese patients, performance on the LFT was more severely impaired compared to that on the CFT while the opposite trend was found in the Turkish counterpart, suggesting that letter fluency performance was more degraded in Japanese patients. Finally, Analysis 3 was conducted to examine the relative order of letter fluency impairment among Japanese, Turkish and English-speaking patients. Disassociation in English users with schizophrenia was estimated based on previous meta-analytic reviews. The effect size (ES) for the letter fluency deficit was the largest in the Japanese sample, while the other two groups share similar ESs. The results from the three analyses partially supported the hypothesis for the severity of the letter fluency impairment in patients with schizophrenia. The language-dependency of letter fluency impairment was thought to be explained by the theoretical model built on unique properties of sound and writing systems. The considerations presented here would provide useful information for optimizing the portability of cognitive tasks across languages. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cytokine-mediated inflammation has been thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of ICNV. The purpose of this study was to investigate serum cytokine profiles in patients with ICNV and to explore the relationship between serum cytokine levels and ICNV severity.MethodsThis case-control study was conducted in 32 ICNV patients and 30 healthy volunteers. Clinical and demographic information was obtained from the medical data platform and the serum was analysed with a multiplex assay to determine the levels of seven cytokines: interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, IL-15, IL-17, basic fibroblast growth factor (basic FGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).ResultsSerum levels of IL-2, IL-10, IL-17, basic FGF, and VEGF were elevated in ICNV patients compared to controls. Serum GM-CSF levels were positively related to central retinal thickness, and serum IL-17 levels were positively related to CNV lesion area.ConclusionSerum inflammatory cytokines were significantly elevated in ICNV patients compared to controls. This suggests that systemic inflammation may play a critical role in the physiopathology of ICNV.

The cytochrome P450 complement (CYPome) of Mycosphaerella graminicola	BIOTECHNOLOGY AND APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						cytochromes P450; environmental biotechnology; monooxygenases	P450; WHEAT; RECONSTITUTION; GENES	Mycosphaerella graminicola is a key fungal pathogen of wheat and a major target for azole fungicides, many of whose central mode of action is through inhibition of cytochrome P450 51 (lanosterol 14-demethylase) in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. The range of activities of other fungal CYPs is thought to be a reflection of the differences between different organisms and their range of secondary metabolic pathways as a response to their niche environments, for example, in the production of mycotoxins. The present study collates information from a range of databases, to classify the CYPs found in M. graminicola and assign them an internationally recognized nomenclature, which, when referenced to the recent publication of the JGI version 2.0 genome model, creates a current, robust model for the CYP complement (CYPome) of M. graminicola. These CYPome data, which examined 82 CYPs and one pseudo-gene, may be utilized not only to further characterize and describe the physiology of the organism but also to enhance our understanding of CYP function and diversity.

In Sweden, there is, to our knowledge, no questionnaire assessing shared decision making (SDM) with regard to CRC screening and, therefore, the aim of the study was to translate and culturally adapt the CRC screening module of the National Survey of Medical Decisions (DECISIONS) into a Swedish context. Material and methods: A qualitative design inspired by guidelines based on methods for cross-cultural adaptation of questionnaires was used. In addition, focus group discussions, individual interviews and think-aloud (TA) sessions were performed. Results: Of the 54 items included in the original DECISION survey, 32 were excluded, 22 were modified, and three were added as a result of the qualitative study. How the health care organization communicated and CRC screening knowledge was communicated were found to be the most important cultural differences between Sweden and the USA. The final questionnaire consists of 24 items. Conclusion: The process of translation and cultural adaptation of the CRC screening module of the DECISIONS survey resulted in the removal and modifying of a considerable number of items. The major rationale for the removal and modifying of items can be explained by the different cultural traditions between Sweden and the USA when communicating with the health care system regarding screening participation and how CRC screening information and knowledge is communicated.

Development of an intervention to improve access to living-donor kidney transplantation (the ASK study)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SHORT-FORM; OUTCOMES; TRIAL; RATES	A living-donor kidney transplant (LDKT) is one of the best treatments for kidney failure. The UK's LDKT activity falls behind that of many other countries, and there is evidence of socioeconomic inequity in access. We aimed to develop a UK-specific multicomponent intervention to support eligible individuals to access a LDKT. The intervention was designed to support those who are socioeconomically-deprived and currently disadvantaged, by targeting mediators of inequity identified in earlier work. We identified three existing interventions in the literature which target these mediators: a) the Norway model (healthcare practitioners contact patients' family with information about kidney donation), b) a home education model, and c) a Transplant candidate advocate model. We undertook intervention development using the Person-Based Approach (PBA). We performed in-depth qualitative interviews with people with advanced kidney disease (n = 13), their family members (n = 4), and renal and transplant healthcare practitioners (n = 15), analysed using thematic analysis. We investigated participant views on each proposed intervention component. We drafted intervention resources and revised these in light of comments from qualitative 'think-aloud' interviews. Four general themes were identified: i) Perceived cultural and societal norms; ii) Influence of family on decision-making; iii) Resource limitation, and iv) Evidence of effectiveness. For each intervention discussed, we identified three themes: for the Norway model: i) Overcoming communication barriers and assumptions; ii) Request from an official third party, and iii) Risk of coercion; for the home education model: i) Intragroup dynamics; ii) Avoidance of hospital, and iii) Burdens on participants; and for the transplant candidate advocates model: i) Vested interest of advocates; ii) Time commitment, and iii) Risk of misinformation. We used these results to develop a multicomponent intervention which comprises components from existing interventions that have been adapted to increase acceptability and engagement in a UK population.

Horizontally transferred genes in the ctenophore <i>Mnemiopsis leidyi</i>	PEERJ			English	Article						Evolution; Lateral gene transfer; Hypothesis testing; Phylogenetics	EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS; SUPPORTS SPONGES; SISTER GROUP; NO EVIDENCE; GENOME; BACTERIAL; CONTAMINATION; ALIGNMENT; INSIGHTS; TREE	Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has had major impacts on the biology of a wide range of organisms from antibiotic resistance in bacteria to adaptations to herbivory in arthropods. A growing body of literature shows that HGT between non-animals and animals is more commonplace than previously thought. In this study, we present a thorough investigation of HGT in the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi. We applied tests of phylogenetic incongruence to identify nine genes that were likely transferred horizontally early in ctenophore evolution from bacteria and nonmetazoan eukaryotes. All but one of these HGTs (an uncharacterized protein) are homologous to characterized enzymes, supporting previous observations that genes encoding enzymes are more likely to be retained after HGT events. We found that the majority of these nine horizontally transferred genes were expressed during development, suggesting that they are active and play a role in the biology of M. leidyi. This is the first report of HGT in ctenophores, and contributes to an ever-growing literature on the prevalence of genetic information flowing between non-animals and animals.

Due to the advancements of computer and multimedia technology, many professional training programs have applied technology to provide richer learning content. Blended learning is a learning approach combining online and physical courses. In the blended learning mode, learners can not only learn through multimedia teaching materials, but also interact and practice with teachers and students in online and physical classrooms. However, the conventional blended learning (C-BL) mode mainly presents teaching content through online videos and physical courses. In such a learning environment with one-way information transmission and without experience, it is not easy for most learners to experience the actual situations encountered in the professional training process, which affects their judgment and actual handling performance. In order to tackle this problem, this research adopted spherical video-based virtual reality (SVVR) technology and applied it in a general registered nurse (RN) training program via a blended learning mode. To verify the effects of this teaching approach, a quasi-experimental study was conducted in a RN training program in a large-scale hospital. The experimental group employed the SVVR-BL mode while the control group employed the C-BL mode. The results indicated that the SVVR-BL mode could not only improve learners' learning achievement, but also enhance their problem-solving tendency, metacognition tendency, and classroom engagement. The practical skills test results in the workplace further implied that, compared to the learners who adopted the C-BL mode, learners who adopted the SVVR-BL mode had better judgment, analysis, and overall performance of the handling process when encountering practical problems. As a result, SVVR-BL not only helped learners gain knowledge and improve their higher order thinking, but also assisted them in applying what they had learned to solve real problems. This result can serve as an important reference for SVVR-BL studies and the design of professional training programs in the future.

Identifying and Understanding the Gaps in Care Experienced by Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Patients at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics	JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT AND YOUNG ADULT ONCOLOGY			English	Article						survivorship; oncofertility; psychosocial; social support; treatment; clinical trial		Purpose: In an effort to counteract the differences in improvement in survival rates of adolescents and young adults (AYA), compared to other age groups with cancer, the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics established an AYA cancer program. This study was conducted to gather feedback from AYAs in an effort to generate actionable data for program development. Methods: The target population included patients aged 13-31 treated for malignancy in one of the following disease sites: central nervous system, leukemia, lymphoma, neuroendocrine, sarcoma, and thyroid. A series of four focus groups was held to identify and describe gaps in care and provide suggestions for program development. A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used. Qualitative data were derived from focus group discussion and free-response survey questions, while quantitative data were derived from objective survey questions and electronic medical record data. Results: Across the four focus groups, 24 different AYAs participated, ranging from 8 to 19 individuals per session. Topics discussed included the following: communication, treatment experience, and overall AYA program; finances, work and school, and late effects; relationships, emotions, and spirituality; and body image, infertility, sexuality, risky behavior, and suicide. The results of the analyses corroborated what makes AYAs different from other age groups. The primary theme identified was the unique relationships of AYAs, which can be thought of along a continuum. Conclusions: Information obtained from these analyses has been used to inform specific projects within the development of the AYA program to address patient-identified gaps. For AYAs, the importance of relationships along a continuum should be considered when developing an AYA program, in addition to potential policy or health service research utilization in the future.

Yet whether TVE buildings actually save lives depends critically on whether people trust and evacuate to them, a question that has not previously been researched. We examine the case of the city of Banda Aceh, Indonesia, where a M8.6 earthquake on 11-April-2012 caused a spontaneous mass evacuation but no tsunami. Our survey of residents living near TVE buildings (n = 202) shows that they clearly prefer horizontal evacuation: in the 2012 earthquake, only 26% evacuated to a TVE building, while 74% evacuated horizontally; if a similar earthquake happened in the future, only 32% intend to evacuate to a TVE building, while 68% intend to evacuate horizontally. To investigate the reasons for this, we extend protection motivation theory to examine people's choices among protective actions under social influence. Those who prefer to evacuate horizontally do not trust the safety of the TVE building and think they can reach a safe inland destination in time, while those who prefer to evacuate to a TVE building think they cannot reach a safe inland destination in time. Encouragement from friends and family influences people's evacuation destinations but official information and training do not. These findings suggest that more attention to the social context is crucial for the effectiveness of TVE buildings. Our extension of protection motivation theory to include choices among protective actions under social influence can be broadly useful in research on self-protective behavior in natural hazards, public health, and other contexts.

Their (semi) permanence generates high stakes in what seems like a one-shot game. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically explore a model of short-term area-based conservation that prioritizes adaptive co-management: temporary areas closed to fishing, designed by the fishers they affect, approved by the government, and adapted every 5 years. In this model, no-take zones are adapted through learning and trust-building between fishers and government fisheries scientists. We use integrated social-ecological theory and a case study of a network of such fisheries closures ("fishing refugia") in northwest Mexico to hypothesize a feedback loop between trust, design, and ecological outcomes. We argue that, with temporary and adaptive area-based management, social and ecological outcomes can be mutually reinforcing as long as initial designs are ecologically "good enough" and supported in the social-ecological context. This type of adaptive management also has the potential to adapt to climate change and other social-ecological changes. This feedback loop also predicts the dangerous possibility that low trust among stakeholders may lead to poor design, lack of ecological benefits, eroding confidence in the tool's capacity, shrinking size, and even lower likelihood of social-ecological benefits. In our case, however, this did not occur, despite poor ecological design of some areas, likely due to buffering by social network effects and alternative benefits. We discuss both the potential and the danger of temporary area-based conservation measures as a learning tool for adaptive co-management and commoning.	[Quintana, Anastasia C.

He established the honeybee as a key animal model for experimental behavioural studies on sensory perception, learning and memory, and first correctly interpreted its famous dance communication. Here, we report on a previously unknown letter by the Physicist and Nobel Laureate Albert Einstein that was written in October 1949. It briefly addresses the work of von Frisch and also queries how understanding animal perception and navigation may lead to innovations in physics. We discuss records proving that Einstein and von Frisch met in April 1949 when von Frisch visited the USA to present a lecture on bees at Princeton University. In the historical context of Einstein's theories and thought experiments, we discuss some more recent discoveries of animal sensory capabilities alien to us humans and potentially valuable for bio-inspired design improvements. We also address the orientation of animals like migratory birds mentioned by Einstein 70 years ago, which pushes the boundaries of our understanding nature, both its biology and physics.

J	Parkinson, C; Kleinbaum, AM; Wheatley, T				Parkinson, Carolyn; Kleinbaum, Adam M.; Wheatley, Thalia			Spontaneous neural encoding of social network position	NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PERSON KNOWLEDGE; DOMINANCE; ATTENTION; REPRESENTATION; PERSPECTIVE; POPULARITY; RESPONSES; SELF	Unlike many species that enact social behaviour in loose aggregations (such as swarms or herds), humans form groups comprising many long-term, intense, non-reproductive bonds with non-kin(1). The cognitive demands of navigating such groups are thought to have significantly influenced human brain evolution(2). Yet little is known about how and to what extent the human brain encodes the structure of the social networks in which it is embedded. We characterized the social network of an academic cohort (N = 275); a subset (N = 21) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study involving viewing individuals who varied in terms of 'degrees of separation' from themselves (social distance), the extent to which they were well-connected to well-connected others (eigenvector centrality) and the extent to which they connected otherwise unconnected individuals (brokerage). Understanding these characteristics of social network position requires tracking direct relationships, bonds between third parties and the broader network topology. Pairing network data with multi-voxel pattern analysis, we show that information about social network position is accurately perceived and spontaneously activated when encountering familiar individuals. These findings elucidate how the human brain encodes the structure of its social world and underscore the importance of integrating an understanding of social networks into the study of social perception.

Methods Purposive and convenience sampling was used to recruit physicians and caregivers. Physician focus group sessions were held at key national conferences in the USA and Canada. Caregivers were approached through clinics with established epilepsy surgery programs in the USA and Canada. Thematic analysis was used to identify critical features of decisions about treatment outcomes, procedural trade-offs, values, and concerns surrounding conventional and novel pediatric drug-resistant epilepsy interventions among physicians and caregivers. Results The results highlight the presence of central attributes that are considered by both groups in decision making, such as "chances of seizure freedom", "risk", "availability of evidence", and "cost to families", as well as attributes that reflect important differences between groups. Physicians were focused on the specifics of treatment options, while caregivers thought more holistically, considering the overall well-being of their children. Discussion The findings shaped the development of a discrete choice experiment to understand the likely uptake of different neurotechnologies. We identified differences in decision making and thus designed two discrete choice experiments to elicit preferences for pediatric drug-resistant epilepsy treatments, one aimed at clinicians and one at caregivers. The variation we observed highlights the value of seeking to understand the influences at the point of clinical decision making and incorporating this information into care.

A rise in the spread of misinformation is thought to have played a significant role in vaccine hesitancy. To maximize uptake, it is important to understand why misinformation has been able to take hold at this time and why it may pose a more significant problem within certain contexts. Objective To understand people's COVID-19 beliefs, their interactions with (mis)information during COVID-19 and attitudes towards a COVID-19 vaccine. Design and Participants Bradford, UK, was chosen as the study site to provide evidence to local decision makers. In-depth phone interviews were carried out with 20 people from different ethnic groups and areas of Bradford during Autumn 2020. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted. Results Participants discussed a wide range of COVID-19 misinformation they had encountered, resulting in confusion, distress and mistrust. Vaccine hesitancy could be attributed to three prominent factors: safety concerns, negative stories and personal knowledge. The more confused, distressed and mistrusting participants felt about their social worlds during the pandemic, the less positive they were about a vaccine. Conclusions COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy needs to be understood in the context of the relationship between the spread of misinformation and associated emotional reactions. Vaccine programmes should provide a focused, localized and empathetic response to counter misinformation. Patient or Public Contribution A rapid community and stakeholder engagement process was undertaken to identify COVID-19 priority topics important to Bradford citizens and decision makers.

L.; Tun, Thein Than; Wieringa, Roel J.; Nuseibeh, Bashar			Automated analysis of security requirements through risk-based argumentation	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Structured argumentation; Risk assessment; Security analysis	IDENTIFICATION; THINKING; SAFETY	Computer-based systems are increasingly being exposed to evolving security threats, which often reveal new vulnerabilities. A formal analysis of the evolving threats is difficult due to a number of practical considerations such as incomplete knowledge about the design, limited information about attacks, and constraints on organisational resources. In our earlier work on RISA (Risk assessment in Security Argumentation), we showed that informal risk assessment can complement the formal analysis of security requirements. In this paper, we integrate the formal and informal assessment of security by proposing a unified meta-model and an automated tool for supporting security argumentation called OpenRISA. Using a uniform representation of risks and arguments, our automated checking of formal arguments can identify relevant risks as rebuttals to those arguments, and identify mitigations from publicly available security catalogues when possible. As a result, security engineers are able to make informed and traceable decisions about the security of their computer-based systems. The application of OpenRISA is illustrated with examples from a PIN Entry Device case study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Empirical studies strongly suggest that professional developers involved in real-life industrial projects find the information provided by variants of this approach useful and insightful, but the degree to which it resolves architecture conformance issues is still unclear. Objective: This paper aims to assess the level of architecture conformance achieved by professional architects using Reflexion Modelling, and to determine how the approach could be extended to improve its suitability for this task. Method: An in vivo, multi-case-study protocol was adopted across five software systems, from four different financial services organizations. Think-aloud, video-tape and interview data from professional architects involved in Reflexion Modelling sessions were analysed qualitatively. Results: This study showed that (at least) four months after the Reflexion Modelling sessions less than 50% of the architectural violations identified were removed. The majority of participants who did remove violations favoured changes to the architectural model rather than to the code. Participants seemed to work off two specific architectural templates, and interactively explored their architectural model to focus in on the causes of violations, and to assess the ramifications of potential code changes. They expressed a desire for dependency analysis beyond static-source-code analysis and scalable visualizations. Conclusion: The findings support several interesting usage-in-practice traits, previously hinted at in the literature. These include (1) the iterative analysis of systems through Reflexion models, as a precursor to possible code change or as a focusing mechanism to identify the location of architecture conformance issues, (2) the extension of the approach with respect to dependency analysis of software systems and architectural modelling templates, (3) improved visualization support and (4) the insight that identification of architectural violations in itself does not lead to their removal in the majority of instances.

However, the relationship between viral-induced nuclear vesicles and Bm5 protein is still unclear. Here, our results indicated that BmNPV Bm5 protein participated in the baculovirus infection-induced nuclear vesicle- like structures' invagination thereby influencing the production of occlusion-derived virion (ODV) and occlusion body (OB). The process of nuclear vesicle- like structures' formation was dispensable for the transport or recruitment of ODV major envelope proteins, such as P74 and Bm14. Furthermore, baculovirus-induced nuclear F- actin might provide a direct mechanical force to mediate the scission of large vesicle- like structures from the nuclear membrane. Collectively, these findings illustrated a BmNPV Bm5 protein-induced nuclear membrane invagination pathway and revealed the function of nuclear vesicle- like structures in ODV production.

Long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) constitutes 17-25% of the human genome. LINE-1 hypomethylation correlates with global DNA methylation levels in cancerous cells, but limited information is available on LINE-1 methylation in NTDs. Objective: We determined whether LINE-1 methylation patterns were associated with neural tube development and the possible relations between DNA methylation and key maternal metabolites involved in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism. Design: Global methylation, maternal plasma folic acid, vitamin B-12, and total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations were assessed in 48 NTD and 49 control samples by immunoassay, and LINE-1 methylation levels were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Results: Methylation levels of genomic DNA and LINE-1 decreased significantly in the neural tissue of NTD samples. The risk of NTDs increased with decreasing levels of LINE-1 methylation, with an odds ratio of 5.246 (95% CI: 1.519, 18.124; P = 0.009) for the lowest quartile (methylation level <= 57.94%) compared with the highest quartile (methylation level >= 60.94%). Compared with control subjects, case subjects had lower maternal plasma concentrations of vitamin B-12. Conclusions: Hypomethylation of LINE-1 and genomic DNA was associated with an increased risk of NTDs. Functional insufficiency of maternal plasma vitamin B-12 was associated with NTDs, although no significant correlation could be established between maternal folic acid, vitamin B, tHcy, and LINE-1 methylation.

ANNALS OF THORACIC MEDICINE			English	Article						Cessation; cigarette; price increase; Saudi Arabia; smokers; smoking; tobacco	CONSUMPTION; SMOKERS; STUDENTS; TOBACCO; HABITS	CONTEXT: In Saudi Arabia, no studies have been conducted on the correlation between any possible cigarette's price increase and its effects on cigarette consumption. AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of cigarette smoking in Saudi Arabia and to predict the effect of price increase on cigarette consumption. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted in April and May 2013. METHODS: We developed an Arabic questionnaire with information on demographic and socioeconomic factors, smoking history, and personal opinion on the effect of price increase on cigarette consumption. The questionnaire was distributed in public places such as malls and posted on famous Saudi athlete media's twitter accounts. RESULTS: Among the 2057 included responses, 802 (39%) were current smokers. The smokers' population constituted of 746 (92%) males, of which 546 (68%) had a monthly income equal or greater to 800 US dollars, and 446 (55%) were aged between 21 and 30 years. Multivariate analyses of the risk factors for smoking showed that male gender and older age were associated with greater risk. Despite the current low prices of 2.67 US dollars, 454 smokers (56%) thought that cigarette prices are expensive. When asked about the price of cigarettes that will lead to smoking cessation, 443 smokers (55%) expected that a price of 8.27 US dollars and more per pack will make them quit. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the price of popular cigarettes pack from 2.67 US dollars to 8.27 US dollars is expected to lead to smoking cessation in a large number of smokers in the Saudi population.

SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							TERRA-PRETA; CHEMICAL-PROPERTIES; FAST PYROLYSIS; BLACK CARBON; SOIL; FERTILITY; BIOMASS; GROWTH; MAIZE; AMENDMENT	The application of biochar to strongly weathered soils is thought to supply nutrients and improve nutrient retention. We hypothesized that biochar increases (a) total N, bioavailable macronutrient (NH4-N, P, K, Ca, Mg), micronutrient (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu), and plant-beneficial Na concentrations; and (b) nutrient retention in the topsoil. We grew the native leguminous Brazilian firetree [Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum (Ducke) Barneby] and the exotic beechwood (Gmelina arborea Roxb.) in a full factorial split-split-plot design at La Victoria and Los Zapotes, Ecuadorian Amazonia. The treatments included amendment of mineral fertilizer plus lime, 3 and 6 t ha(-1) biochar (locally produced charcoal), and a control. We sampled the 0-to-0.25- and 0.25-to-0.50-m soil depth layers before the start of the experiment in 2009 and six times until 2013. The site at Los Zapotes was more fertile as reflected by a significant site effect on most studied soil properties in both depth layers. Biochar increased modified Olsen (NaHCO3+EDTA)-extractable Ca (p < .05) and Zn concentrations (p < .1) and total N concentrations (p < .05) in topsoil. Mineral fertilizer plus lime increased Olsen-extractable P, K, Ca, Mg, and Zn concentrations (all p < .05) but reduced Olsen-extractable Fe concentrations (p < .05) in topsoil. Biochar increased Ca (p < 0.1) and Zn (p < .05) retention in mineral fertilized topsoils but decreased total N retention (p < .05) in unfertilized topsoils. The amendment of up to 6 t ha(-1) biochar did not increase the fertility of the studied degraded Amazonian Ultisols sufficiently to enhance tree growth.

The Divergence of Neandertal and Modern Human Y Chromosomes	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							GENOME SEQUENCE; H-Y; SUPPRESSOR; CAVE; GENE	Sequencing the genomes of extinct hominids has reshaped our understanding of modern human origins. Here, we analyze similar to 120 kb of exome-captured Y-chromosome DNA from a Neandertal individual from El Sidron, Spain. We investigate its divergence from orthologous chimpanzee and modern human sequences and find strong support for a model that places the Neandertal lineage as an outgroup to modern human Y chromosomes-including A00, the highly divergent basal haplogroup. We estimate that the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of Neandertal and modern human Y chromosomes is similar to 588 thousand years ago (kya) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 447-806 kya). This is similar to 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7-2.9) times longer than the TMRCA of A00 and other extant modern human Y-chromosome lineages. This estimate suggests that the Y-chromosome divergence mirrors the population divergence of Neandertals and modem human ancestors, and it refutes alternative scenarios of a relatively recent or super-archaic origin of Neandertal Y chromosomes. The fact that the Neandertal Y we describe has never been observed in modern humans suggests that the lineage is most likely extinct. We identify protein-coding differences between Neandertal and modem human Y chromosomes, including potentially damaging changes to PCDH11Y, TMSB4Y, USP9Y, and KDM5D. Three of these changes are missense mutations in genes that produce male-specific minor histocompatibility (H-Y) antigens. Antigens derived from KDM5D, for example, are thought to elicit a maternal immune response during gestation. It is possible that incompatibilities at one or more of these genes played a role in the reproductive isolation of the two groups.	[Mendez, Fernando L.; Poznik, G.

An emotion understanding framework for intelligent agents based on episodic and semantic memories	AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Emotion understanding ability; Episodic memory; Semantic memory; Intelligent agents; Multi-agent simulation	DESIGN; MODEL	Emotional intelligence is the ability to process information about one's own emotions and the emotions of others. It involves perceiving emotions, understanding emotions, managing emotions and using emotions in thought processes and in other activities. Emotion understanding is the cognitive activity of using emotions to infer why an agent is in an emotional state and which actions are associated with the emotional state. For humans, knowledge about emotions includes, in part, emotional experiences (episodic memory) and abstract knowledge about emotions (semantic memory). In accordance with the need for more sophisticated agents, the current research aims to increase the emotional intelligence of software agents by introducing and evaluating an emotion understanding framework for intelligent agents. The framework organizes the knowledge about emotions using episodic memory and semantic memory. Its episodic memory learns by storing specific details of emotional events experienced firsthand or observed. Its semantic memory is a lookup table of emotion-related facts combined with semantic graphs that learn through abstraction of additional relationships among emotions and actions from episodic memory. The framework is simulated in a multi-agent system in which agents attempt to elicit target emotions in other agents. They learn what events elicit emotions in other agents through interaction and observation. To evaluate the importance of different memory components, we run simulations with components "lesioned". We show that our framework outperformed Q-learning, a standard method for machine learning.

The main goal in code comprehension is to extract information that is used in the software maintenance stage. Generating the structural model from the source code helps to alleviate the software maintenance cost. Software module clustering is thought to be a viable reverse engineering approach for building structural design models from source code. Finding the optimal clustering model is an NP-complete problem. The primary goals of this study are to minimize the number of connections between created clusters, enhance internal connections inside clusters, and enhance clustering quality. The previous approaches' main flaws were their poor success rates, instability, and inadequate modularization quality. The Olympiad optimization algorithm was introduced in this paper as a novel population-based and discrete heuristic algorithm for solving the software module clustering problem. This algorithm was inspired by the competition of a group of students to increase their knowledge and prepare for an Olympiad exam. The suggested algorithm employs a divide-and-conquer strategy, as well as local and global search methodologies. The effectiveness of the suggested Olympiad algorithm to solve the module clustering problem was evaluated using ten real-world and standard software benchmarks. According to the experimental results, on average, the modularization quality of the generated clustered models for the ten benchmarks is about 3.94 with 0.067 standard deviations. The proposed algorithm is superior to the prior algorithms in terms of modularization quality, convergence, and stability of results. Furthermore, the results of the experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm can be used to solve other discrete optimization problems efficiently. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

Studies have questioned the current hypoglycaemia treatment cut-off level of 2.5 mmol/l. Improved knowledge about health workers' attitudes towards and management of hypoglycaemia is needed to understand the potential effects of a raised cut-off level. Objective: This research explored health workers' perceptions about managing acutely ill children with hypoglycaemia in a Malawian referral hospital. A secondary objective was to explore health workers' opinions about a potential increase in the hypoglycaemia cut-off level. Methods: We used a qualitative design with semi-structured individual interviews performed with health workers in the Paediatric Accident and Emergency Unit at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Malawi, in October 2016. Data were analysed using latent content analysis. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Malawi, College of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee P.01/16/1852. Results: Four themes were formed that described the responses. The first, 'Critical and difficult cases need easy treatment', showed that health workers perceived hypoglycaemia as a severe condition that was easily manageable. The second, 'Health system issues', revealed challenges relating to staffing and resource availability. The third, 'From parental reluctance to demand', described a change in parents' attitudes regarding intravenous treatments. The fourth, 'Positive about the change but need more information', exposed health workers' concerns about potential risks of a raised cut-off level for hypoglycaemia treatment, as well as benefits for the patients. Conclusions: Health workers perceived hypoglycaemia as a severe condition that is easy to manage when the required equipment and supplies are available. Due to the common lack of test equipment and dextrose supplies, health workers have adopted alternative strategies to diagnose and manage hypoglycaemia. A change to the hypoglycaemia treatment cut-off level raised concerns about potential risks, but was also thought to be of benefit for some patients.

A framework for assessing regional biodiversity condition under changing environments of the arid Australian rangelands	RANGELAND JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th Conference of the Australian-Rangeland-Society	SEP 28-OCT 02, 2008	Queensland, AUSTRALIA	Australian Rangeland Soc		biodiversity monitoring; biodiversity and ecosystem functioning; biodiversity surrogacy; climate change; ecological indicators	MAPPING VEGETATION CONDITION; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; MONITORING-SYSTEM; VARIABILITY; POWER; INDICATORS; ECOLOGY; DESIGN; SCALE; ANTS	Rangelands support many ecosystem services important to humans, including climate regulation. They also have a significant role to play in the mitigation of greenhouse gases. However, the capacity of any rangeland to do this depends foremost upon the condition of biodiversity, and the functioning of its ecosystems. Considerable research has been undertaken on rangeland condition but it has not yet included the assessment of biodiversity (plants, animals and microbes) as a primary focus. Rangeland managers have struggled to assess biodiversity condition because it is rarely defined, is everywhere (so what do you assess?), is always changing in response to natural and human disturbances (so how do you know when it has changed?) and what amount signals management action. Here we present a framework that addresses these issues, and apply it to select surrogates and indicators that are scientifically defensible in biological and planning terms for assessing biodiversity. An arid Australian rangeland region is used as a case study to develop and apply our approach. We were not able to illustrate interpretation of condition because of the absence of long-term monitoring data in Australian rangelands, but we do provide guiding principles about sampling design and analytical methods for interpretation that use raw data rather than multimetrics. We discovered that different management outcomes expected to be informed from assessing biodiversity condition affected surrogate and indicator choice, and that a number indicators were not robust when assessed on conceptual relevance, measurement qualities, feasibility of implementation and policy and management relevance for four different management outcomes. Our work highlights the importance of stating the expected outcomes of biodiversity condition assessments up front, so that indicators relevant to future management are chosen. It also shows that critical thought on the robustness of indicators is warranted, especially as condition assessments under climate change will require information on the functional traits of species. We conclude by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of our framework in relation to environmental planning.	[Smyth, A.

J	Appelgren, E; Lindén, CG				Appelgren, Ester; Linden, Carl-Gustav			Data Journalism as a Service: Digital Native Data Journalism Expertise and Product Development	MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION			English	Article						boundary work; data journalism; digital native; Finland; journalism; peripheral actors; Sweden	NEWS STARTUPS; ONLINE; RESOURCE; FIELD	The combined set of skills needed for producing data journalism (e.g., investigative journalism methods, programming, knowledge in statistics, data management, statistical reporting, and design) challenges the understanding of what competences a journalist needs and the boundaries for the tasks journalists perform. Scholars denote external actors with these types of knowledge as interlopers or actors at the periphery of journalism. In this study, we follow two Swedish digital native data journalism start-ups operating in the Nordics from when they were founded in 2012 to 2019. Although the start-ups have been successful in news journalism over the years and acted as drivers for change in Nordic news innovation, they also have a presence in sectors other than journalism. This qualitative case study, which is based on interviews over time with the start-up founders and a qualitative analysis of blog posts written by the employees at the two start-ups, tells a story of journalists working at the periphery of legacy media, at least temporarily forced to leave journalism behind yet successfully using journalistic thinking outside of journalistic contexts.

J	Ukpong, DI; Abasiubong, F				Ukpong, Dominic Ignatius; Abasiubong, Festus			Stigmatising attitudes towards the mentally ill: A survey in a Nigerian university teaching hospital	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							COMMUNITY; ILLNESS; PEOPLE	Background. The burden of mental illness is particularly severe for people living in low-income countries. Negative attitudes towards the mentally ill, stigma experiences and discrimination constitute part of this disease burden. Objective. The aim of this study was to investigate knowledge of possible causes of mental illness and attitudes towards the mentally ill in a Nigerian university teaching hospital population. Method. A cross-sectional descriptive study of a convenience sample of 208 participants from the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital, Uyo, Nigeria, using the Community Attitudes towards the Mentally III (CAMI) scale. Information was also obtained on beliefs about possible causes of mental illness. Results. The respondents held strongly negative views about the mentally ill, mostly being authoritarian and restrictive in their attitudes and placing emphasis on custodial care. Even though the respondents appeared to be knowledgeable about the possible role of psychosocial and genetic factors in the causation of mental illness, 52.0% of them believed that witches could be responsible, 44.2% thought mental illness could be due to possession by demons, and close to one-third (30%) felt that it could be a consequence of divine punishment. Conclusions. Stigma and discrimination against the mentally ill are widespread even in a population that is expected to be enlightened. The widespread belief in supernatural causation is likely to add to the difficulties of designing an effective anti-stigma psycho-educational programme. There is a need in Nigeria to develop strategies to change stigma attached to mental illness at both institutional and community levels.

The generative rules that shape the topology of the human connectome remain incompletely understood. Earlier work in model organisms has suggested that wiring rules based on geometric relationships (distance) can account for many but likely not all topological features. Here we systematically explore a family of generative models of the human connectome that yield synthetic networks designed according to different wiring rules combining geometric and a broad range of topological factors. We find that a combination of geometric constraints with a homophilic attachment mechanism can create synthetic networks that closely match many topological characteristics of individual human connectomes, including features that were not included in the optimization of the generative model itself. We use these models to investigate a lifespan dataset and show that, with age, the model parameters undergo progressive changes, suggesting a rebalancing of the generative factors underlying the connectome across the lifespan.

Plans, Habits, and Theory of Mind	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RATIONAL ACTION; TIME PRESSURE; 2 SYSTEMS; MODEL; PUNISHMENT; HUMANS; INFORMATION; JUDGMENT; BEHAVIOR; BELIEFS	Human success and even survival depends on our ability to predict what others will do by guessing what they are thinking. If I accelerate, will he yield? If I propose, will she accept? If I confess, will they forgive? Psychologists call this capacity "theory of mind." According to current theories, we solve this problem by assuming that others are rational actors. That is, we assume that others design and execute efficient plans to achieve their goals, given their knowledge. But if this view is correct, then our theory of mind is startlingly incomplete. Human action is not always a product of rational planning, and we would be mistaken to always interpret others' behaviors as such. A wealth of evidence indicates that we often act habitually-a form of behavioral control that depends not on rational planning, but rather on a history of reinforcement. We aim to test whether the human theory of mind includes a theory of habitual action and to assess when and how it is deployed. In a series of studies, we show that human theory of mind is sensitive to factors influencing the balance between habitual and planned behavior.

Weaponization of a Hormone: Convergent Recruitment of Hyperglycemic Hormone into the Venom of Arthropod Predators	STRUCTURE			English	Article							SPIDER-VENOM; FUNCTIONAL-CHARACTERIZATION; INSECTICIDAL PEPTIDES; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; SODIUM-CHANNELS; GATING MODIFIER; SCORPION TOXIN; ANIMAL TOXINS; FAMILY; POTASSIUM	Arthropod venoms consist primarily of peptide toxins that are injected into their prey with devastating consequences. Venom proteins are thought to be recruited from endogenous body proteins and mutated to yield neofunctionalized toxins with remarkable affinity for specific subtypes of ion channels and receptors. However, the evolutionary history of venom peptides remains poorly understood. Here we show that a neuropeptide hormone has been convergently recruited into the venom of spiders and centipedes and evolved into a highly stable toxin through divergent modification of the ancestral gene. High-resolution structures of representative hormone-derived toxins revealed they possess a unique structure and disulfide framework and that the key structural adaptation in weaponization of the ancestral hormone was loss of a C-terminal a helix, an adaptation that occurred independently in spiders and centipedes. Our results raise a new paradigm for toxin evolution and highlight the value of structural information in providing insight into protein evolution.	[Undheim, Eivind A.

The present study was designed to examine whether YKS improves age-related anxiety using F344/N aged rats. Moreover, the effects of YKS on liver function were examined. Materials and methods: YKS was administered to 21-month-old aged rats for 3 months. Locomotor activity of young control (4 months old), aged control (24 months old), and YKS-treated aged rats was examined, and the anxiety-related responses of these animals were evaluated by counting the number of excrements during locomotor activity measurement and in the elevated plus-maze test. The extracellular concentrations of serotonin and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were also measured using a microdialysis technique. Moreover, concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and ammonia (NH(3)) in plasma were measured. Results: Although locomotor activity did not change among any experimental groups, the number of excrements was significantly increased in aged rats compared to young rats, and this increase was significantly improved by YKS treatment. Aged rats also showed significant decreases in time and frequency in the open arm of the elevated plus-maze, and these decreases were significantly improved by YKS treatment. Extracellular concentrations of serotonin and dopamine in the aged PFC were significantly decreased: serotonin was increased over the level of young rats and dopamine was partially improved by YKS treatment, respectively. In addition, YKS improved age-related increase in NH3 concentration, but did not affect AST and ALT. Conclusions: YKS has improving activity for age-related increased anxiety and enhances serotonergic and dopaminergic transmissions in the aged PFC. These mechanisms provide information important for the treatment of anxiety in the elderly. Furthermore, the present data confirm partially the Kampo concept "liver disease".

Innovations devised collectively by patients, caregivers, professionals and other members of the public can foster transformative change toward more responsive services and research. However, attempts to involve lay and professional stakeholders in devising community-framed strategies to address the unmet needs of rare diseases are lacking. In this study, we engaged with the community of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) to assess its needs and elicit social innovations to promote people-centred care and research. Methods: Drawing on a qualitative study, we conducted three think tanks in France with a total of 48 participants, including patients/ family members (n = 18), health care professionals (n = 7), researchers (n = 7) and people combining several of these roles (n = 16). Participants came from 20 countries across five continents. They were selected from the registry of the Second World Conference on CDG through heterogeneity and simple random sampling. Inductive and deductive approaches were employed to conduct interpretational analysis using open, axial and selective coding, and the constant-comparison method to facilitate the emergence of categories and core themes. Results: The CDG community has unmet needs for information, quality health care, psychosocial support and representation in decision-making concerned with care and research. According to participants, these needs can be addressed through a range of social innovations, including peer-support communities, web-based information resources and a CDG expertise platform. Conclusion: This is one of the few studies to engage lay and professional experts in needs assessment and innovation for CDG at a global level. Implementing the innovations proposed by the CDG community is likely to have ethical, legal and social implications associated with the potential donation of patients' clinical and biological material that need to be assessed and regulated with involvement from all stakeholders. To promote people-centred care for the CDG community, and increase its participation in the governance of care and research, it is necessary to create participatory spaces in which the views of people affected by CDG can be fully expressed.

Prevalence of PTSD in Survivors of Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack: A Meta-Analytic Review	PLOS ONE			English	Review							POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; HEART-DISEASE; SYMPTOMS; RECURRENCE; MORTALITY; SCALE; RISK	Background and Purpose: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in survivors of acute life-threatening illness, but little is known about the burden of PTSD in survivors of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). This study estimated the prevalence of stroke or TIA-induced posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Potentially relevant peer-reviewed journal articles were identified by searching the Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PILOTS Database, The Cochrane Library and Scopus from inception to January 2013; all searches were conducted on January 31, 2013. Observational cohort studies that assessed PTSD with specific reference to a stroke or TIA that occurred at least 1 month prior to the PTSD assessment were included. PTSD rates and characteristics of the study and sample were abstracted from all included studies. The coding of all articles included demographics, sample size, study country, and method and timing of PTSD assessment. Results: Nine studies (N = 1,138) met our inclusion criteria. PTSD rates varied significantly across studies by timing of PTSD assessment (i.e., within 1 year of stroke/TIA versus greater than 1 year post-stroke/TIA; 55% of heterogeneity explained; Q(1) = 10.30; P = .001). Using a random effects model, the estimated rate of PTSD following stroke or TIA was 23% (95% CI, 16%-33%) within 1 year of the stroke or TIA and 11% (95% CI, 8%-14%) after 1 year. Conclusions: Although PTSD is commonly thought to be triggered by external events such as combat or sexual assault, these results suggest that 1 in 4 stroke or TIA survivors develop significant PTSD symptoms due to the stroke or TIA. Screening for PTSD in a large population-based prospective cohort study with cardiovascular outcome assessments is needed to yield definitive prevalence, and determine whether stroke or TIA-induced PTSD is a risk factor for subsequent cardiovascular events or mortality.

The ontogenetic isotopic profiles of foraminifers are also thought to record ecological information about species, such as changes in habitat depth and symbiotic relationships. However, isotopic profiles during "individual ontogeny" have rarely been examined. In this study, we report the ontogenetic isotopic information for three net-collected modern species, Globigerinoides sacculifer, Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, and Globorotalia inflata, together with several in situ oceanographic parameters of the water column in Sagami Bay, Japan (seawater temperature, salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll a content, delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon [DIC], and delta O-18 of seawater). We examined the ontogenetic profiles of the foraminifers with chamber dissection and chamber-by-chamber analyses of delta C-13 and delta O-18 using a specially designed continuous-flow mass spectrometry system. The ontogenetic delta O-18 profiles showed overall O-18-enrichment in all three species, suggesting their ontogenetic migration toward deeper habitats. When these records were compared with the physicochemical profiles of the water column, all the ontogenetic records began within the uppermost thermocline or shallower, corresponding to the depth of relatively high chlorophyll content. Later in ontogeny, Gs. sacculifer and N. dutertrei migrated to the bottom of the level of maximum chlorophyll, whereas Gr. inflata descended to a depth of 200 m. The deviations of foraminiferal delta C-13 from the delta C-13 of DIC were largest in the juvenile stages, but were near zero at a test mass of ca. 10 mu g for all three species. Contrary to the subsequent asymptotic profiles of this deviation in N. dutertrei and Gr. inflata, Gs. sacculifer alone showed a subsequent increase, of up to +1.0%, reflecting its symbiotic relationship. We conclude that a certain ontogenetic test mass, in this case of around 10 mu g, can be assigned to a preferable size class of foraminifers from which to reconstruct the paleo-delta C-13 of DIC in the water column, regardless of the species ecology.

Given differences between conservatives and liberals in threat sensitivity and dangerous-world beliefs, correlations between political orientation and negatively-biased credulity may thus reflect endogenous mindsets. Alternatively, such results may owe to the political hierarchy at the time of previous research, as the tendency to see dark forces at work is thought to be greater among those who are out of political power. Adjudicating between these accounts can inform how societies respond to the challenge of alarmist disinformation campaigns. We exploit the consequences of the 2016 U.S. elections to test these competing explanations of differences in negatively-biased credulity and conspiracism as a function of political orientation. Two studies of Americans reveal continued positive associations between conservatism, negatively-biased credulity, and conspiracism despite changes to the power structure in conservatives' favor.

However, the association between monocyte subsets and cardiometabolic disorders and CVD is not well-understood. Thus, the aim of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate recent findings from clinical studies that examined the association between the distribution of monocyte subsets in subjects with cardiometabolic disorders and CVD compared to healthy controls. Methods: Articles were systematically searched in CINAHL, PubMed and Cochrane Library. Articles were independently screened and selected by two reviewers. Studies that reported the percentage of each monocyte subset were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. For the meta-analysis, a random-effects model was used to generate pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) between subjects with cardiometabolic disorders and healthy controls. Results: A total of 1,693 articles were screened and 27 studies were selected for qualitative analyses. Among them, six studies were included in the meta-analysis. In total, sample size ranged from 22 to 135 and mean or median age from 22 to 70 years old. We found studies that reported higher percentage and number of IM and/or NCM in subjects with cardiometabolic disorders (9 out of 13 studies) and in subjects with CVD (11 out of 15 studies) compared to healthy controls. In the meta-analysis, the percentage of CM was lower [SMD = -1.21; 95% CI (-1.92, -0.50); P = 0.0009; I-2 = 91%] and the percentage of IM [SMD = 0.56; 95% CI (0.23, 0.88); P = 0.0008; I-2 = 65%] and NCM [SMD = 1.39; 95% CI (0.59, 2.19); P = 0.0007; I-2 = 93%] were higher in subjects with cardiometabolic disorders compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: Individuals with cardiometabolic disorders and CVD may have a higher percentage of IM and NCM than healthy controls. Future studies are needed to evaluate the cause and biological significance of this potential altered distribution of monocyte subsets.

However, information regarding the regulation of mineral elements release in soil is scarce. Here, we examined the long-term (i.e., 23 yrs) effects of fertilisation practices on Fe minerals in a red soil in Southern China. The results from chemical analysis and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that long-term swine manure (M) treatment released greater amounts of minerals into soil solutions than chemical fertilisers (NPK) treatment, and Fe played a dominant role in the preservation of dissolved organic C. Furthermore, Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge fine structure spectroscopy demonstrated that reactive Fe minerals were mainly composed of less crystalline ferrihydrite in the M-treated soil and more crystalline goethite in the NPK-treated soil.

J	Gott, M; Ingleton, C; Bennett, MI; Gardiner, C				Gott, Merryn; Ingleton, Christine; Bennett, Michael I.; Gardiner, Clare			Transitions to palliative care in acute hospitals in England: qualitative study	BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							OF-LIFE CARE; HEART-FAILURE; CANCER; END; SPOTLIGHT; PEOPLE	Objective To explore how transitions to a palliative care approach are perceived to be managed in acute hospital settings in England. Design Qualitative study. Setting Secondary or primary care settings in two contrasting areas of England. Participants 58 health professionals involved in the provision of palliative care in secondary or primary care. Results Participants identified that a structured transition to a palliative care approach of the type advocated in UK policy guidance is seldom evident in acute hospital settings. In particular they reported that prognosis is not routinely discussed with inpatients. Achieving consensus among the clinical team about transition to palliative care was seen as fundamental to the transition being effected; however, this was thought to be insufficiently achieved in practice. Secondary care professionals reported that discussions about adopting a palliative care approach to patient management were not often held with patients; primary care professionals confirmed that patients were often discharged from hospital with "false hope" of cure because this information had not been conveyed. Key barriers to ensuring a smooth transition to palliative care included the difficulty of "standing back" in an acute hospital situation, professional hierarchies that limited the ability of junior medical and nursing staff to input into decisions on care, and poor communication. Conclusion Significant barriers to implementing a policy of structured transitions to palliative care in acute hospitals were identified by health professionals in both primary and secondary care. These need to be addressed if current UK policy on management of palliative care in acute hospitals is to be established.

This needs solutions to decrease burdens on the healthcare systems especially during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Population knowledge, perception and attitude towards influenza vaccine during COVID19 pandemic could have a positive impact to decrease mortality, morbidity and burdens on the healthcare system. This study focuses on investigating knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of Jordanian adults towards influenza vaccine during COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 1112 randomly selected Jordanian adults. A four-part questionnaire was designed and included questions about the demographic and clinical characteristics, perception about influenza, attitudes towards the role of influenza vaccine during COVID-19 pandemic and the factors that affect respondents' practice towards influenza vaccine.Results: 73.1% population were not vaccinated, and most were not willing to be vaccinated during the COVID-19 pandemic. 55% of the population thought that influenza vaccine decreased the burden on the Jordanian healthcare system. The major refusal factor to be vaccinated was because influenza was not considered as a threat (41.3%). People mostly got their information about influenza vaccine from social media (64.3%). The role of the pharmacist and physician was neglected.Conclusions: The reinforcement of the role of pharmacists, physician and media to educate people about the importance of influenza vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic is needed. Furthermore, campaigns should be conducted to increase the population awareness towards the importance of influenza vaccine uptake and its importance.

Methods This is a physician-driven, population- and electronic-based registry implemented for both retrospective and prospective collection of real-world demographics, clinical, laboratory, instrumental and socioeconomic data of patients with uveitis and other non-infectious inflammatory ocular diseases recruited through the AIDA Network. Data recruitment, based on the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tool, is thought to collect standardised information for real-life research and has been developed to change over time according to future scientific acquisitions and potentially communicate with other similar instruments. Security, data quality and data governance are cornerstones of this platform. Results Ninety-five centres have been involved from 19 countries and four continents from 24 March to 16 November 2021. Forty-eight out of 95 have already obtained the approval from their local ethics committees. At present, the platform counts 259 users (95 principal investigators, 160 site investigators, 2 lead investigators, and 2 data managers). The AIDA Registry collects baseline and follow-up data using 3943 fields organised into 13 instruments, including patient's demographics, history, symptoms, trigger/risk factors, therapies and healthcare utilization for patients with NIU. Conclusions The development of the AIDA Registry for patients with NIU will facilitate the collection of standardised data leading to real-world evidence and enabling international multicentre collaborative research through inclusion of patients and their families worldwide.

This study examines the correlation between snoring and carotid artery disease through use of duplex ultrasound identifying greater than 50% internal carotid artery stenosis. Study Design Prospective cohort study. Methods Patients presenting to three academic vascular laboratories for carotid duplex examination completed the following surveys: demographic information, assessment of risk factors for carotid stenosis, assessment of history of obstructive sleep apnea, or continuous positive airway pressure use and Snoring Outcomes Survey. Patients were categorized into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of carotid disease. Data were analyzed by univariate contingency tables and logistic regression analysis. Results Five hundred one patients completed the survey, of whom 243/501 (49%) had evidence of carotid occlusive disease. On univariate analysis, smoking, hypertension, heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and stroke all correlated with greater than 50% carotid stenosis. Multivariate analysis indicated that snorers were significantly more likely to have carotid disease. Three hundred twenty-seven participants were thought to have primary snoring. On univariate analysis, snorers were found to be significantly more likely to have carotid disease. After adjustment for covariates, snoring was not significant for carotid disease. However, multivariate analysis showed snorers to be significantly more likely to have bilateral carotid disease. Conclusions This study shows a potential relationship between snoring and bilateral carotid artery stenosis greater than 50%; snorers have risk of carotid stenosis twice that of nonsnorers. Further investigation is warranted to better elucidate this relationship.

Synaptic dysfunction leads to a reduction in the rate of metabolism of glucose in the brain and is thought to represent AD progression. FDG-PET has the unique ability to estimate glucose metabolism, providing information on the distribution of hypometabolism. In addition, patients with AD exhibit significant neuronal loss in cerebral regions, and previous AD research has shown that structural MRI can be used to sensitively measure cortical atrophy. In this paper, we introduced a new method to discriminate AD from NC based on complementary information obtained by FDG and MRI. For accurate classification, surface-based features were employed and 12 predefined regions were selected from previous studies based on both MRI and FDG-PET. Partial least square linear discriminant analysis was employed for making diagnoses. We obtained 93.6% classification accuracy, 90.1% sensitivity, and 96.5% specificity in discriminating AD from NC. The classification scheme had an accuracy of 76.5% and sensitivity and specificity of 46.5% and 89.6%, respectively, for discriminating MCI from AD. Our method exhibited a superior classification performance compared with single modal approaches and yielded parallel accuracy to previous multimodal classification studies using MRI and FDG-PET.

A detailed investigation into the BvARF family is performed, including analysis of the conserved domains, chromosomal locations, phylogeny, exon-intron structure, conserved motifs, subcellular localization, gene ontology (GO) annotations and expression profiles of BvARF under salt-tolerant condition. The majority of BvARF proteins contain B3 domain, AUX_RESP domain and AUX/IAA domain and a few lacked of AUX/IAA domain. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the 16 BvARF proteins are clustered into six groups. Expression profile analysis shows that most of these BvARF genes in sugar beet under salinity stress were up-regulated or down-regulated to varying degrees and nine of the BvARF genes changed significantly. They were thought to have a significant response to salinity stress. The current study provides basic information for the BvARF genes and will pave the way for further studies on the roles of BvARF genes in regulating sugar beet's growth, development and responses to salinity stress.

Orchestration tools support teachers by providing awareness indicators of students' progress as well as levers to control the flow of the lesson. We designed and evaluated the impact of an orchestration tool for a series of robot-based learning activities to teach a basic concept in mathematics to children, aged 7-10. Six teachers in primary schools across Switzerland used the orchestration tool to manage the activities in six sessions involving a total of ninety-one students. We observed teachers' usage of the orchestration tool during the sessions and interviewed them after the sessions about the usefulness of these functionalities. Our findings show that even though teachers used the tool in different ways from each other, in general, it supported them in their classroom orchestration practices, mainly to manage the activity sequence and get aware of the robot technical failures and, to a lesser degree, get aware of students' progress for the purpose of activity transitions and enriching class discussions. We discuss the theoretical implications of these results, relating our findings to the literature on classroom orchestration tool design, especially highlighting the importance of educational level and the type of learning technology as contextual factors affecting teachers' usage of orchestration tools. We also provide implications for designing orchestration tools, focusing on the necessity of providing different types of awareness indicators and multiple options for activity management to fulfil the variety of teachers' orchestration needs.

Originally thought to trigger a disease of only mild symptoms, recently Chikungunya virus caused large-scale fatalities and widespread economic loss that was linked to recent virus genetic mutation and evolution. Due to the paucity of information on Chikungunya immunological progression, we investigated the serum levels of 13 cytokines/chemokines during the acute phase of Chikungunya disease and 6- and 12-month post-infection follow-up from patients of the Italian outbreak. We found that CXCL9/MIG, CCL2/MCP-1, IL-6 and CXCL10/IP-10 were significantly raised in the acute phase compared to follow-up samples. Furthermore, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, Il-12, IL-10, IFN-gamma and IL-5 had low initial acute phase levels that significantly increased at later time points. Analysis of symptom severity showed association with CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP-10 and IgG levels. These data give insight into Chikungunya disease establishment and subsequent convalescence, which is imperative to the treatment and containment of this quickly evolving and frequently re-emerging disease.

Kelly			DNA Binding of Centromere Protein C (CENPC) Is Stabilized by Single-Stranded RNA	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							KINETOCHORE; CHROMATIN; HETEROCHROMATIN; ORGANIZATION; COMPONENT; HISTONE-H3; REQUIRES; DOMAINS; COMPLEX	Centromeres are the attachment points between the genome and the cytoskeleton: centromeres bind to kinetochores, which in turn bind to spindles and move chromosomes. Paradoxically, the DNA sequence of centromeres has little or no role in perpetuating kinetochores. As such they are striking examples of genetic information being transmitted in a manner that is independent of DNA sequence (epigenetically). It has been found that RNA transcribed from centromeres remains bound within the kinetochore region, and this local population of RNA is thought to be part of the epigenetic marking system. Here we carried out a genetic and biochemical study of maize CENPC, a key inner kinetochore protein. We show that DNA binding is conferred by a localized region 122 amino acids long, and that the DNA-binding reaction is exquisitely sensitive to single-stranded RNA. Long, single-stranded nucleic acids strongly promote the binding of CENPC to DNA, and the types of RNAs that stabilize DNA binding match in size and character the RNAs present on kinetochores in vivo. Removal or replacement of the binding module with HIV integrase binding domain causes a partial delocalization of CENPC in vivo. The data suggest that centromeric RNA helps to recruit CENPC to the inner kinetochore by altering its DNA binding characteristics.	[Du, Yaqing; Topp, Christopher N.; Dawe, R.

Material and methods: We interviewed 24 immunisation providers who deliver immunisation services to migrant populations in Melbourne. We used the WHO Behavioural and Social Drivers framework (underlined) to organise barriers and enablers to COVID-19 vaccination. Results: Participants believed migrants had concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy and saw vaccines as minimally beneficial in the 'low COVID-190 environment of Australia (what people think and feel). Healthcare providers with established relationships within migrant communities played key roles in vaccine advocacy (social processes). Migrants' vaccine motivation was mediated by health literacy, institutional trust and previous experiences with health services. Practical issues included perceived lack of information on vaccine booking process and accessibility challenges. Conclusions: Strategies to increase migrant vaccine coverage should utilise immunisation providers with community links and trusted local vaccine ambassadors to engage and address community vaccine concerns. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This complex can be manipulated in a number of ways, one of which is through the strychnine-insensitive glycine receptor coagonist site. The effects of Bioglycin(R) (Konapharma, Pratteln, Switzerland), a biologically active form of the amino acid glycine, were therefore studied in healthy students (mean age, 20.7 years) and middle-aged men (mean age, 58.9 years) with tests that measured attention, memory and mood, using a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Compared with the young group, the middle-aged group had significantly poorer verbal episodic memory, focused, divided, and sustained attention; they also differed in their subjective responses at the end of testing. Bioglycin significantly improved retrieval from episodic memory in both the young and the middle-aged groups, but it did not affect focused or divided attention. However, the middle-aged men significantly benefited from Bioglycin in the sustained-attention task. The effects of Bioglycin differed from those of other cognitive enhancers in that it was without stimulant properties or significant effects on mood, and it primarily improved memory rather than attention. It is Likely to be of benefit in young or older people in situations where high retrieval of information is needed or when performance is impaired by jet lag, shift work, or disrupted sleep. It may also benefit the impaired retrieval shown in patients with schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease.

LABORATORY PHONOLOGY			English	Article						speech perception; vowel perception; sociophonetics; Australian English; New Zealand English	SPEECH-PERCEPTION; WORKING-MEMORY; TALKER GENDER; CAPACITY; IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION	The presence of culturally significant objects has been shown to induce biases in speech perception consistent with features of the dialect relevant to the object. Questions remain about the transferability of this effect to different dialect contexts, and the efficacy of the task in inducing the effect. This paper details an Australian-context experiment modelled on Hay and Drager's (2010) New Zealand-context stuffed toy study. Seventy-five listeners heard spoken Australian English (AusE) phrases with phrase-final monosyllabic words containing either kit, DRESS, or TRAP vowels. Each phrase was followed by audio presentation of a six-step synthesized vowel continuum, from New Zealand English (NZE)-like to exaggerated AusE-like tokens. Listeners attempted to match one of the synthesized variants to the speaker's realization of the target vowel. Listeners were exposed to one of two priming conditions, established by stuffed toy kiwis (New Zealand) and stuffed toy koalas (Australia), or a control condition (no toy). Contrary to Hay and Drager (2010), token selections did not differ significantly between the New Zealand and Australian priming conditions. However, reversing the order of continuum presentation did significantly affect token selection for KIT vowels, raising questions about the task design itself. Results suggest that the influence of regional primes on speech perception may be more limited than previously thought.

Regarding the current wireline network paradigm, dominated by the copper-based digital subscriber lines (DSL) technology, multi-Gigabit data rate is the ambitious design objective at the customer end for the forthcoming ITU-T G.mgfast standard. In order to prepare for the new challenges in the era of total network convergence, both the wireline and the wireless community must be able to think beyond their respective conventions and learn from each other if necessary. Overall, the current DSL-based wireline network architecture is prone to the mutual interference resulting in far-end crosstalk (FEXT). The newly expanded 424/848 MHz spectrum of the ambitious G.mgfast project introduces far higher FEXT than that over the current 212/30 MHz G.fast/VDSL2 band. Additionally, the coexistence of multiple standards will also cause & x2018;alien & x2019; FEXT. In these cases, using the plain zero forcing precoding (ZFP) will no longer attain a sufficiently high performance. However, as shown in the field of wireless communications, using lattice reduction as a signal space remapping technique significantly improves the performance of traditional multi-user detectors (MUD) and of the respective multi-user precoders (MUP). These promising techniques have largely remained unexploited in commercial wireless communications, due to their complexity in the face of the rapidly fluctuating wireless channels. In this survey, we present an overview of the state-of-the-art in wireline access network and an outlook for recent technological advances in the holistic & x2018;wireline & x002B; wireless & x2019; access network in the context of network convergence, focusing on the dominant challenge of FEXT mitigation in future DSL networks. Against this background, we investigate both the family of linear precoding and of the Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) schemes conceived for classic DSL. Furthermore, we present a tutorial on the family of lattice reduction aided MUPs, as well as quantifying their expected performances in realistic DSL scenarios. As a by-product, we also demonstrate the duality between MUP and MUD, in the hope that the fifty years & x2019; history of MUD could be used to accelerate the development of efficient near-optimal MUPs for future DSL. Under the recommended operating conditions of the 212 MHz profile of G.fast, our benchmark comparisons indicate that the lattice reduction aided techniques are very powerful compared to conventional schemes. In particular, their good performances do not rely on optimized spectrum balancing, and they are also shown to be relatively robust against channel state information (CSI) estimation error, under the assumption of perfectly time-invariant DSL channels.

Everest) during the Last 25000 Years	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RECENT CLIMATE-CHANGE; ICE CORE; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; GLACIAL REFUGIA; MIGRATION CAPACITY; GENETIC DIVERSITY; PLANT DIVERSITY; MOUNT EVEREST; PLATEAU; MICROSATELLITES	Microrefugia at high altitudes or high latitudes are thought to play an important role in the post-glacial colonization of species. However, how populations in such microrefugia have responded to climate changes in alternating cold glacial and warm interglacial stages remain unclear. Here we present evidence to indicate the Rongbuk Valley of the Mt. Qomolangma (Mt. Everest) area, the highest region on earth, had microrefugia for Hippophae tibetana and discuss how this low shrub was adapted to the extreme climate fluctuations of the last 25,000 years by shifts. By integrating geological, glaciological, meteorological, and genetic information, we found that the Rongbuk Valley was not only a glacial microrefugium but also an interglacial microrefugium for H. tibetana: the former was located on the riverbank below 4800 m above sea level (asl) or lower area and the latter at similar to 5000 m asl. Our results show that after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), H. tibetana in the valley has undergone upward and downward migrations around similar to 5000 m driven by climate fluctuations and the population in the glacial microrefugium has suffered extinction or extreme contraction. Moreover, with the rise of temperature in the last four decades, the upper limit of H. tibetana has shifted at least 30 m upward. Combining population history and recent range shift of this species is important in predicting the fate of this endemic species to future climate changes.

J	Corti, P; Kralidis, AT; Lewis, B				Corti, Paolo; Kralidis, Athanasios Tom; Lewis, Benjamin			Enhancing discovery in spatial data infrastructures using a search engine	PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Data discovery; Catalogue Service for the Web; Metadata; WorldMap; Geoportal; Search engine; Spatial Data Infrastructure; pycsw; Solr; GeoNode	SDI	A spatial data infrastructure (SDI) is a framework of geospatial data, metadata, users and tools intended to provide an efficient and flexible way to use spatial information. One of the key software components of an SDI is the catalogue service which is needed to discover, query and manage the metadata. Catalogue services in an SDI are typically based on the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW) standard which defines common interfaces for accessing the metadata information. A search engine is a software system capable of supporting fast and reliable search, which may use 'any means necessary' to get users to the resources they need quickly and efficiently. These techniques may include full text search, natural language processing, weighted results, fuzzy tolerance results, faceting, hit highlighting, recommendations and many others. In this paper we present an example of a search engine being added to an SDI to improve search against large collections of geospatial datasets. The Centre for Geographic Analysis (CGA) at Harvard University re-engineered the search component of its public domain SDI (Harvard WorldMap) which is based on the GeoNode platform. A search engine was added to the SDI stack to enhance the CSW catalogue discovery abilities. It is now possible to discover spatial datasets from metadata by using the standard search operations of the catalogue and to take advantage of the new abilities of the search engine, to return relevant and reliable content to SDI users.

Local resilience forums (LRFs), due to their multiagency nature, offer a shared situational awareness and understanding of the need in their local communities. Such information is critical to ensure messaging about heat risks and available resources are tailored to reach specific targeted groups within their communities. Scenario planning and adaptation efforts require a more local articulation which LRFs are well placed to manage.Conclusions: LRFs are well suited as key structures in the English emergency response to extreme heat events. We suggest that English public health and hospital organisations, working with community partners via the LRFs, must develop their thinking about pressures from adverse weather in the summer months.

Typically, one thinks of dosimetry as what happens when a particle is inhaled, where it is deposited, and how it is cleared from the body. However, this paper shows a much more complicated picture starting with emissions sources, showing how the source-to-intake fraction (iF) can be used to estimate changes in the inhaled dose due to changes in emissions and then ending with particle-liquid, particle-cellular and subcellular interactions, and movement of ultrafine particles across the lung-blood barrier. These latter issues begin to suggest mechanisms that can lead to adverse health effects; the former can provide guidance to policy decisions designed to reduce the health impact of atmospheric particles. The importance of ultrafine particles, their ability to translocate to other parts of the body, and the potential impact of these particles has advanced significantly over the last decade, including studies that show the movement of ultrafine particles along the olfactory nerves in the nose with direct transport to the brain, the neurological effects of which are still unknown. Incremental advancements continue with regards to understanding particle deposition, including regional and local deposition (including hot spots) and clearance and the factors that affect these variables, in part due to the development and implementation of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models and digital imaging of the lungs. CFD modeling will continue to provide new information for reducing uncertainty in dosimetric calculations. We understand better today how a number of diseases may develop based on the fate of particles after deposition in the respiratory track and how changes in source emissions might impact that dose. However, a number of uncertainties remain, some of which can be reduced by addressing the research needs stated in this paper.

In stroke recovery, dose of a nonpharmaceutical intervention appears to influence outcome but is often poorly reported. The challenges of articulating dose in nonpharmacological stroke recovery research include: (1) the absence of specific internationally agreed dose reporting guidelines; (2) inadequate conceptualization of dose, which is multidimensional; and (3) unclear and inconsistent terminology that incorporates the multiple dose dimensions. To address these challenges, we need a well-conceptualized and consistent approach to dose articulation that can be applied across stroke recovery domains to stimulate critical thinking about dose during intervention development, as well as promote reporting of planned intervention dose versus actually delivered dose. We followed the Design Research Paradigm to develop a framework that guides how to articulate dose, conceptualizes the multidimensional nature and systemic linkages between dose dimensions, and provides reference terminology for the field. Our framework recognizes that dose is multidimensional and comprised of a duration of days that contain individual sessions and episodes that can be active (time on task) or inactive (time off task), and each individual episode can be made up of information about length, intensity, and difficulty. Clinical utility of this framework was demonstrated via hypothetical application to preclinical and clinical domains of stroke recovery. The suitability of the framework to address dose articulation challenges was confirmed with an international expert advisory group. This novel framework provides a pathway for better articulation of nonpharmacological dose that will enable transparent and accurate description, implementation, monitoring, and reporting, in stroke recovery research.

Given the recent shortages, there must be a civilian plan for massively bleeding patients when there are no blood products on the shelf. Recognizing that the time to death in bleeding patients is less than 2 h, timely resupply from unaffected locations is not possible. One solution is to transfuse emergency untested whole blood (EUWB), similar to the extensive military experience fine-tuned over the last 19 years. While this concept is anathema in current civilian transfusion practice, it seems prudent to have a vetted plan in place. Methods and Materials: During the early stages of the 2020 global pandemic, a multidisciplinary and international group of clinicians with broad experience in transfusion medicine communicated routinely. The result is a planning document that provides both background information and a highlevel guide on how to emergently deliver EUWB for patients who would otherwise die of hemorrhage. Results and Conclusions: Similar plans have been utilized in remote locations, both on the battlefield and in civilian practice. The proposed recommendations are designed to provide high-level guidance for experienced blood bankers, transfusion experts, clinicians, and health authorities. Like with all emergency preparedness, it is always better to have a well-thought-out and trained plan in place, rather than trying to develop a hasty plan in the midst of a disaster. We need to prevent the potential for empty shelves and bleeding patients dying for lack of blood.

To explore the perceptions of caring and expectations of nursing care in patients on a heart and/or lung transplant waiting list. Background. The waiting period for a heart or lung transplant can be very stressful and demanding for patients and their families. Care during the waiting period needs to be aimed at treating the symptoms and complications of patients' underlying condition and also specific issues related to organ transplant candidacy. Method. A qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews with 22 patients on a heart and/or lung transplant waiting list was used. Participants were interviewed on three separate occasions. Findings. Qualitative analysis of the data revealed five major themes related to the nursing care needs of heart and lung transplant candidates. The themes were identified as information giving, maintenance of regular contact, familiarity, positive thinking and compassionate manner. These were five key aspects of communication within the nurse-patient relationship and formed the essence of caring as perceived by patients awaiting heart and/or lung transplantation. Conclusion. Transplant candidates often experience prolonged waiting times for a transplant which is often laden with uncertainties and stress. This study provided an in-depth description of patients' perceptions of caring and their nursing care needs whilst on a heart and lung transplant waiting list. Relevance to clinical practice. The findings provide useful advice to nurses about ways they can improve care and enhance caring for patients waiting for an organ transplant. Key elements of nursing care that foster the nurse-patient relationship that can be incorporated into nursing care pathways have been highlighted.

Perception of young adults with sickle cell disease or sickle cell trait about participation in the CHOICES randomized controlled trial	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						computerized intervention; genetic education; Internet research; patient education; qualitative research; randomized control trial respondents; reproductive knowledge; sickle cell disease	QUALITATIVE CONTENT-ANALYSIS; HEMOGLOBIN DISORDERS; RISK INFORMATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ATTITUDES; BELIEFS; PEOPLE	Aims. To gain an in-depth understanding of the perceptions of young adults with sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait about parenthood and participating in the CHOICES randomized controlled trial that used computer-based, educational programmes. Background. In the USA, there is insufficient education to assure that all young adults with sickle cell disease or sickle cell trait understand genetic inheritance risks and reproductive options to make informed reproductive decisions. To address this educational need, we developed a computer-based, multimedia program (CHOICES) and reformatted usual care into a computer-based (e-Book) program. We then conducted a two-year randomized controlled trial that included a qualitative component that would deepen understanding of young adults' perceptions of parenthood and use of computer-based, educational programmes. Design. A qualitative descriptive approach completed after a randomized controlled trial. Methods. Sixty-eight men and women of childbearing age participated in semi-structured interviews at the completion of the randomized controlled trial from 2012-2013. Thematic content analysis guided the qualitative description. Results/findings. Three main themes were identified: (1) increasing knowledge and new ways of thinking and behaving; (2) rethinking parenting plans; and (3) appraising the program design and delivery. Most participants reported increased knowledge and rethinking of their parenting plans and were supportive of computer-based learning. Some participants expressed difficulty in determining individual transmission risks. Conclusion. Participants perceived the computer programs as beneficial to their learning. Future development of an Internet-based educational programme is warranted, with emphasis on providing tailored education or memory boosters about individual transmission risks.

Drugs of abuse increase dopamine (DA) concentration in these brain areas, including the striatum, which shapes an abnormal memory trace of drug consumption that virtually highjacks reward processing. Long-term neuronal adaptations of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic striatal projection neurons (SPNs) evoked by drugs of abuse are critical for the development of addiction. These neurons form two mostly segregated populations, depending on the DA receptor they express and their output projections, constituting the so-called direct (D-1 receptor) and indirect (D-2 receptor) SPN pathways. Both SPN subtypes receive converging glutamate inputs from limbic and cortical regions, encoding contextual and emotional information, together with DA, which mediates reward prediction and incentive values. DA differentially modulates the efficacy of glutamate synapses onto direct and indirect SPN pathways by recruiting distinct striatal signaling pathways, epigenetic and genetic responses likely involved in the transition from casual drug use to addiction. Herein we focus on recent studies that have assessed psychostimulant-induced alterations in a cell-type-specific manner, from remodeling of input projections to the characterization of specific molecular events in each SPN subtype and their impact on long-lasting behavioral adaptations. We discuss recent evidence revealing the complex and concerted action of both SPN populations on drug-induced behavioral responses, as these studies can contribute to the design of future strategies to alleviate specific behavioral components of addiction.

Early classification of time series using multi-objective optimization techniques	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Time series classification; Early classification; Multi-objective optimization	ALGORITHM	In early classification of time series the objective is to build models which are able to make class-predictions for time series as accurately and as early as possible, when only a part of the series is available. It is logical to think that accuracy and earliness are conflicting objectives, since the more we wait, more data points from the series are available, and it is easier to make accurate class-predictions. Considering this, the problem can be very naturally formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, and solved as such. However, the solutions proposed in the literature up to now, reduce the problem into a single-objective problem by combining both objectives somehow. In this paper, we present a novel multi-objective formulation of the problem of early classification, and we design a solution using multi-objective optimization techniques. This method will provide a variety of solutions which find different trade-offs between both objectives, allowing the user to select the most suitable solution a-posteriori, depending on the accuracy and earliness requirements of the problem at hand. To prove the usefulness of our proposal, we carry out an extensive experimentation process using 45 benchmark databases and we present a case study in the financial domain. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.
