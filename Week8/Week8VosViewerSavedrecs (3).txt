Receptivity of Hospitalized Older Adults and Family Caregivers to Prognostic Information about Aging, Injury, and Frailty: A Qualitative Study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES			English	Article						Frailty; Prognostic Information; Aging; Injury; Older adults	PALLIATIVE CARE; COMMUNICATION PRACTICES; DECISION-MAKING; DISABILITY; LIFE; TRAJECTORIES; PERCEPTIONS; GOALS; END	Background: Frailty is the leading prognosticator for poor outcomes and palliative care among older adults. Delivery of negative prognostic information entails potentially difficult conversations about decline and death. Objective: The study aims were to: 1) examine hospitalized older adults' and family caregivers' receptivity to general (vs. individualized) prognostic information about frailty, injury, and one-year outcomes; and 2) determine information needs based on prognostic information. Design: Provision of general prognostic information followed by semi-structured interview questions. We deductively analyzed qualitative data within the context of problematic integration theory. Setting: An academic medical center in the Southeast region of the U.S. Participants: Purposive sampling was utilized to obtain a distribution of patients across the frailty continuum (non-frail [N=10], pre-frail [N=9], frail [9=6]). Twenty-five older adults (>= age 65) hospitalized for a primary injury (e.g. fall) and 15 family caregivers of hospitalized patients were enrolled. Methods: Hospitalized older patients and family caregivers were shown prognostic information about one-year outcomes of injured older adults in the form of simple pictographs. Semi-structured interview questions were administered immediately afterwards. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Demographic and medical information data were used to contextualize the responses during analysis. Results: Overall, participants (patients [56%], caregivers [73%]) were open to receiving prognostic information. A small number of family caregivers (N=3) expressed reservations about the frankness of the information and suggested delivery through a softer approach or not at all. Qualitative data was coded using categories and constructs of problematic integration theory. Four codes (personalizing the evidence, vivid understanding, downhill spiral, realities of aging) reflected probabilistic and evaluative orientation categories of problematic integration theory. One code (fatalism vs. hope) represented manifestations of ambivalence and ambiguity in the theory; and another code (exceptionalism) represented divergence and impossibility. Two codes (role of thought processes, importance of faith) reflected forms of resolutions as described in problematic integration theory. Information needs based on prognostic information revealed four additional codes: give it to me straight, what can I do? what can I expect? and how can I prevent decline? A consistently reported desire of both patients and caregivers was for honesty and hope from providers. Conclusion: This study supports the use of general prognostic information in conversations about aging, injury, frailty and patient outcomes. Incorporating prognostic information into communication aids can facilitate shared decision making before end-of-life is imminent. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Only a few studies in Affordance theory deal with investigating blockchain. This paper aims to discover affordances in blockchain when designing an AI-based financial recommendation system as a decision support system. The design thinking methodology was extended with machine learning and business process modelling to discover financial offerings, digital objects to be tokenised, advantages gained from the tracing affordances and consensus mechanism, and the role of smart contracts for each persona. The implementation of discovered blockchain-based applications requires a multichain framework to meet the requirements of design affordances.

A review of evaluation methodologies and practices to assess the value of climate information services for farmers: Implications for Africa	CLIMATE SERVICES			English	Review						Climate information services; Smallholder farmers; Agriculture; Monitoring and evaluation; Impact; Value; Africa	ECONOMIC VALUE; BURKINA-FASO; WEST-AFRICA; FORECASTS; IMPACT; AGRICULTURE; VARIABILITY; SCIENCE; END	This paper addresses the need for more rigorous evaluation of climate service projects and investments given the existence of little evidence on the actual value of climate services and the challenges that hamper current efforts to evaluate the impact of climate services for the agricultural community. Based on our in-depth review of existing literature from Africa and around the world, we find that rigorous methods for evaluating climate services span qualitative context-based and quantitative methodological approaches. The few studies that have been conducted so far to determine the value of climate services for farmers were for initiatives that incorporated in their design an evaluation framework. This highlights the importance of experimentally designing climate service programs for evaluation based on an impact pathway, rather than leaving evaluation as an after-thought. To strengthen the evidence base on the actual value of climate information services, complementary evaluation efforts will need to draw on a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches, be sensitive to the heterogeneity of user groups, and go beyond the focus on agricultural production to include other dimensions of the agricultural system.

The purpose of this paper is to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze lyric videos to understand their design trends via three modalities: word motion, font style, and music style. These trends will not only be helpful as hints for designing new lyric videos but also be meaningful to quantitatively reveal the thought processes of the video design professionals. To achieve this, we needed to develop or utilize several technologies. First, we developed a lyric word tracking method to capture the motion of individual lyric words. The proposed method uses the lyric text as the guiding information for word tracking to overcome the difficulties arising from the various word appearances and motions. Second, we developed a font style estimator to quantify the appearance of each word as a feature vector. Finally, we employed a music style estimator to quantify the mood of the music, e.g., "techno" and "fast." We then analyzed feature vectors of these three style modalities collected at 3,494 time points in 100 lyric videos. After revealing the trend of each modality via k-means, we conducted a co-occurrence analysis to understand the correlation between each modality pair. Our experimental results indicate that such a cluster-wise co-occurrence analysis can capture interesting trends hidden in lyric video designs.

Supporting Creativity and Appreciation of Uncertainty in Exploring Geo-coded Public Health Data	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Epidemiology; creativity; geographic information systems; visualization; public health	GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SCIENCE; FUTURE	Background and Objectives: We present a prototype visualisation tool, ADVISES (Adaptive Visualization for e-Science), designed to support epidemiologists and public health practitioners in exploring geo-coded datasets and generating spatial epidemiological hypotheses. The tool is designed to support creative thinking while providing the means for the user to evaluate the validity of the visualization in terms of statistical uncertainty. We present an overview of the application and the results of an evaluation exploring public health researchers' responses to maps as a new way of viewing familiar data, in particular the use of thematic maps with adjoining descriptive statistics and forest plots to support the generation and evaluation of new hypotheses. Methods: A series of qualitative evaluations involved one experienced researcher asking, 21 volunteers to interact with the system to perform a series of relatively complex, realistic map-building and exploration tasks, using a 'think aloud' protocol, followed by a semi-structured interview The volunteers were academic epidemiologists and UK National Health Service analysts. Results: All users quickly and confidently created maps, and went on to spend substantial amounts of time exploring and interacting with system, generating hypotheses about their maps. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the tool is able to support creativity and statistical appreciation among public health professionals and epidemiologists building thematic maps. Software such as this, introduced appropriately, could increase the capability of existing personnel for generating, public health intelligence.	[Thew, S.

Considering the deep penetration of digital technologies in everyday life, digital literacy offers a set of transversal skills that could improve a whole area of activities, from banking operations to civic participation. However, these skills are diverse and vary according to the development of technologies and society. This study fills an important academic gap on digital literacy by placing it in a specific and well-defined context, analyzing different perspectives that involve such learning, such as predictors of digital literacy in different types of students. In addition, research increases its importance as it is being developed during the pandemic, a period characterized by accelerated technological use and sudden changes. This research used a quantitative design based on the answers to a questionnaire conducted from March 2021 to May 2021. From a methodological perspective, we tested several hypotheses using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) within the structural equation model (SEM). The results show that communication, critical thinking, problem-solving, and technical digital skills are more present in the case of students enrolled in social sciences, while other digital skills (i.e., creativity and information) are more prevalent in the case of humanities students. Moreover, the results showed that, except for creativity and problem-solving-related digital skills, all of the digital skills were significantly influenced by students' different levels of education.

Through this collaborative group-based process, each co-design group engaged in a four-phase process to discover, define, develop, and deliver an intervention that took the form of a paper-based mobile app prototype. Young people reported that they need information and advice to support their and others' online decision making, help making situational decision-making skills for managing online interactions, and means to control information and images that can be accessed and distributed. Detailed app features that they required to address their decision-making needs are also discussed.

However, the functional significance of STPs remains largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Finding: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we first identified an STPs-network whose activity was positively correlated with the subjects' tendency of having STPs during a task-free state. The STPs-network was then found to be strongly associated with the default network, which has previously been established as being active during the task-free state. Interestingly, we found that offline reprocessing of previously memorized information further increased the activity of the STPs-network regions, although during a state with less STPs. In addition, we found that the STPs-network kept a dynamic balance between functional integration and functional separation among its component regions to execute offline memory reprocessing in STPs. Conclusion/Significance: These findings strengthen a view that offline memory reprocessing and STPs share the brain's default network, and thus implicate that offline memory reprocessing may be a predetermined function of STPs. This supports the perspective that memory can be consolidated and modified during STPs, and thus gives rise to a dynamic behavior dependent on both previous external and internal experiences.

Many of these claims are untrustworthy because the bases are unreliable. Acting on unreliable claims can lead to waste of resources and poor health outcomes. Yet, most people lack the necessary skills to appraise the reliability of health claims. The Informed Health Choices (IHC) project aims to equip young people in Ugandan lower secondary schools with skills to think critically about health claims and to make good health choices by developing and evaluating digital learning resources. To ensure that we create resources that are suitable for use in Uganda's secondary schools and can be scaled up if found effective, we conducted a context analysis. We aimed to better understand opportunities and barriers related to demand for the resources, how the learning content overlaps with existing curriculum and conditions in secondary schools for accessing and using digital resources, in order to inform resource development. Methods We used a mixed methods approach and collected both qualitative and quantitative data. We conducted document analyses, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, school visits, and a telephone survey regarding information communication and technology (ICT). We used a nominal group technique to obtain consensus on the appropriate number and length of IHC lessons that should be planned in a school term. We developed and used a framework from the objectives to code the transcripts and generated summaries of query reports in Atlas.ti version 7. Findings Critical thinking is a key competency in the lower secondary school curriculum. However, the curriculum does not explicitly make provision to teach critical thinking about health, despite a need acknowledged by curriculum developers, teachers and students. Exam oriented teaching and a lack of learning resources are additional important barriers to teaching critical thinking about health. School closures and the subsequent introduction of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated teachers' use of digital equipment and learning resources for teaching. Although the government is committed to improving access to ICT in schools and teachers are open to using ICT, access to digital equipment, unreliable power and internet connections remain important hinderances to use of digital learning resources. Conclusions There is a recognized need for learning resources to teach critical thinking about health in Ugandan lower secondary schools. Digital learning resources should be designed to be usable even in schools with limited access and equipment. Teacher training on use of ICT for teaching is needed.

Digital technology is transforming the educational spaces we inhabit, as well as our way of processing information. Although there are already numerous studies that have addressed this technological reality, only a handful have done so from a theoretical perspective. That is why we present research that seeks to reinforce the latest theoretical contributions for understanding how modern technology may be affecting the way in which knowledge is built. Based on the latest research in social constructivism, this is a qualitative study designed to contribute to the creation of a specific theoretical framework for an onlife world. An ill-structured task and a semi-structured interview were used to observe the use of the thinking skills that enable us to build knowledge and the relationship between them. The results show that the ways of building knowledge are changing, as digital technology fosters the use of higher-order thinking skills that, furthermore, operate in a chaotic, complex, and unpredictable manner. In conclusion, this study upholds the notion that the ways of building knowledge are changing, but we still need more empirical contributions to create a generally accepted theoretical construct for explaining how we build knowledge through digital technology.

J	Lee, YF; Tawfik, DS; Griffiths, AD				Lee, YF; Tawfik, DS; Griffiths, AD			Investigating the target recognition of DNA cytosine-5 methyltransferase <i>Hha</i>I by library selection using <i>in vitro</i> compartmentalisation	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; METHYLATION; VIVO; ENZYMES; CLONING; DESIGN; SYSTEM; DOMAIN; BASE; GENE	In vitro compartmentalisation (IVC), a technique for selecting genes encoding enzymes based on compartmentalising gene translation and enzymatic reactions in emulsions, was used to investigate the interaction of the DNA cytosine-5 methyltransferase M.HhaI with its target DNA (5'-GCGC-3'). Crystallog raphy shows that the active site loop from the large domain of M.HhaI interacts with a flipped-out cytosine (the target for methylation) and two target recognition loops (loops I and II) from the small domain make almost all the other base-specific interactions. A library of M.HhaI genes was created by randomising all the loop II residues thought to make base-specific interactions and directly determine target specificity. The library was selected for 5'-GCGC-3' methylation. Interestingly, in 11 selected active clones, 10 different sequences were found and none were wild-type. At two of the positions mutated (Ser252 and Tyr254) a number of different amino acids could be tolerated. At the third position, however, all active mutants had a glycine, as in wild-type M.HhaI, suggesting that Gly257 is crucial for DNA recognition and enzyme activity. Our results suggest that recognition of base pairs 3 and 4 of the target site either relies entirely on main chain interactions or that different residues from those identified in the crystal structure contribute to DNA recognition.

J	Sydelko, P; Midgley, G; Espinosa, A				Sydelko, Pamela; Midgley, Gerald; Espinosa, Angela			Designing interagency responses to wicked problems: Creating a common, cross-agency understanding	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Problem structuring methods; OR in government; Systems thinking; Interagency; Wicked problems	PROBLEM-STRUCTURING METHODS; CRITICAL SYSTEMS THINKING; BOUNDARY CRITIQUE; HEALTH; INTERVENTION; METHODOLOGY; REFLECTIONS; INFORMATION; FRAMEWORK; DYNAMICS	Wicked problems are open-ended, highly interdependent issues that cross agency, stakeholder, jurisdictional, and geopolitical boundaries. In response, there has been advocacy for interagency working. However, this confounds conventional approaches to government because policies and budgets tend to be aligned within organizational boundaries and not across them, making it difficult to bring the appropriate talent, knowledge and assets into an interagency approach to tackle the interdependencies of whatever wicked problem is at hand. In addition, the purposes, perspectives and values of the various government agencies and other stakeholders can often be in conflict. This paper reports on research to develop and evaluate a systemic intervention approach involving the use of multiple methods underpinned by boundary critique to address a wicked problem. The major focus is how to create a common understanding of a wicked problem among multiple agencies using a participatory problem structuring method called 'systemic perspective mapping'. The wicked problem we tackled was international organized drug crime and its intersection with local urban gang activity (using Chicago, USA, as a representative city). Perspectives on the problem were structured with participation from various local, regional and federal agencies involved in countering illegal drug trafficking. Our research found that the combined use of boundary critique and systemic perspective mapping was able to generate enough of a common understanding to provide a foundation for the design of an interagency organization using the viable system model (the latter is reported elsewhere in the literature).

Designing for uncertain, asymmetric control: Interaction design for brain-computer interfaces	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article						Brain-computer interaction; EEG; Text entry	CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; TOP	Designing user interfaces which can cope with unconventional control properties is challenging, and conventional interface design techniques are of little help. This paper examines how interactions can be designed to explicitly take into account the uncertainty and dynamics of control inputs. In particular, the asymmetry of feedback and control channels is highlighted as a key design constraint, which is especially obvious in current non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Brain-computer interfaces are systems capable of decoding neural activity in real time, thereby allowing a computer application to be directly controlled by thought. BCIs, however, have totally different signal properties than most conventional interaction devices. Bandwidth is very limited and there are comparatively long and unpredictable delays. Such interfaces cannot simply be treated as unwieldy mice. In this respect they are an example of a growing field of sensor-based interfaces which have unorthodox control properties. As a concrete example, we present the text entry application "Hex-O-Spell", controlled via motor-imagery based electroencephalography (EEG). The system utilizes the high visual display bandwidth to help compensate for the limited control signals, where the timing of the state changes encodes most of the information. We present results showing the comparatively high performance of this interface, with entry rates exceeding seven characters per minute. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we compare neural versus engineering strategies for constructing networks. During circuit development, synapses are overproduced and then pruned back over time, whereas in engineered networks, connections are initially sparse and are then added over time. We provide a computational perspective on these two different approaches, including discussion of how and why they are used, insights that one can provide the other, and areas for future joint investigation. By thinking algorithmically about the goals, constraints, and optimization principles used by neural circuits, we can develop brain-derived strategies for enhancing network design, while also stimulating experimental hypotheses about circuit development and function.

Consequently, its outreach within engineering design is interpreted differently in the scholarly community. At the same time, the claimed powerful support in tackling technical problems of any degree of difficulty conflicts with TRIZ diffusion in industrial settings, which is relatively low according to insights into product development practices. The mismatch between ambitious goals and moderate spill-over benefits in the industry ranges among the various open issues concerning TRIZ, its way of thinking, its effectiveness, the usability of its tools. In order to provide a general overview of TRIZ in science, the authors have attempted to analyse reliable and influential sources from the literature. The performed survey includes the top 100 indexed publications concerning TRIZ, according to the number of received citations. Variegated and poorly interconnected research directions emerge in the abundant literature that tackles TRIZ-related topics. The outcomes of the investigation highlight the successful implementation of TRIZ within, among the others, biomimetics and information processing. The traditional borders of mechanical and industrial engineering have been frequently crossed, as the use of TRIZ is also witnessed in the domain of business and services. At the same time, computer-aided platforms represent diffused attempts to boost TRIZ diffusion and applicability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study is to prioritize ways to bridge the gap. Methods: The study was based on an online survey of high-ranking scientists and policy makers who have a senior position in universities and governments in the health sector in China and Canada. The sampling frame comprised of universities with schools of public health and medicine and various levels of government in health and public health. Participants included university presidents and professors, and government deputy ministers, directors general and directors working in the health field. Fourteen strategies were presented to the participants for ranking as current ways and ideal ways in the future to bridge the gap between science and policy. Results: Over a 3-month survey period, there were 121 participants in China and 86 in Canada with response rates of 30.0 and 15.9 %, respectively. The top strategies selected by respondents included focus on policy (conducting research that focuses on policy questions), science-policy forums, and policy briefs, both as current ways and ideal ways to bridge the gap between science and policy. Conferences were considered a priority strategy as a current way, but not an ideal way in the future. Canadian participants were more in favor of using information technology (web-based portals and email updates) than their Chinese counterparts. Among Canadian participants, two strategies that were ranked low as current ways (collaboration in study design and collaboration in analysis) became a priority as ideal ways. This could signal a change in thinking in shifting the focus from the "back end" or "downstream" (knowledge dissemination) of the knowledge transfer process to the "front end" or "upstream" (knowledge generation). Conclusions: Our international study has confirmed a number of previously reported priority strategies to bridge the gap between science and policy. More importantly, our study has contributed to the future work on evidence-based policy making by comparing the responses from China and Canada and the current and ideal way for the future. Our study shows that the concept and strategies of bridging the gap between science and policy are not static but varying in space and evolving over time.	[Choi, Bernard C.

J	Huston, P				Huston, P			What does the public think of placebo use? The Canadian experience	SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Placebo - Its Action and Place in Health Research Today	APR 12-13, 2003	WARSAW, POLAND			placebo controlled trial (PCT); ethics; placebos; clinical trials; public consultations; randomized control trials; risk assessment; deliberative dialogue		Part of the National Placebo Initiative in Canada included public consultations, based on the belief that the views of the public should inform Canadian policy development on what constitutes appropriate placebo use. Public consultations took place nationally in 2003. A deliberative dialogue approach was used, or a structured discussion format designed to facilitate the consideration of complex issues and build consensus. The placebo debate was characterized as having 3 distinct approaches and each were explored. The first approach "Maximize Patient Protection" identified the need for experts to determine appropriate placebo use and that placebos should only be allowed under very restricted conditions. The second approach "Maximize Medical Knowledge" identified that placebos give essential information about the safety and efficacy of new drugs, and are appropriate when the rights, safety and well-being of research participants are ensured. The third approach "Maximize Patient Autonomy" identified that the current system of regulating placebo use is paternalistic and that patients should be able to define what is in their best interests and have more leeway to determine for themselves if they wish to participate in a placebo-controlled trial. Advantages and disadvantages of each approach were considered and feedback on what constitutes appropriate placebo use was sought. The major findings were that: PCTs were considered a valuable and acceptable part of advancing medical knowledge; research using placebos must be valid and justifiable; a patient-centred approach needs to be fostered; patient autonomy (choice) should be a first consideration and take clear precedence in trials of low to medium risk; patient protection (or health) may need to "trump" patient autonomy at higher levels of risk and/or patient vulnerability; placebos are not a violation of the duty of care as duty of care is best met by identifying a choice for patients, whenever a choice is available. These consultations clearly were not designed to produce conclusive evidence, but rather to provide some useful insights into what the public may think about placebo use; additional studies are indicated.

The co-fabrication space is a modern-day equivalent of a new factory type, and it makes use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as sensors, software, and online connectivity, to keep track of various building features, analyze data, and produce reports on usage patterns and trends that can be used to improve building operations and the environment. The co-fabrication user requires dynamic and flexible space, which is different from the conventional user's usage. Because the user composition in a co-fabrication space is dynamic and unstable, we cannot use the conventional approach to assess their usage and rentals. Prototyping necessitates a specifically designed energy-saving strategy. The research uses a "seeing-moving-seeing" design thinking framework, which enables designers to more easily convey their ideas to others through direct observation of the outcomes of their intuitive designs and the representation of their works through design media. The three components of human behavior, physical manufacture, and digital interaction are primarily the focus of this work. The computing system that connects the physical machine is created through communication between the designer and the digital interface, giving the designer control over the physical machine. It is an interactive fabrication process formed by behavior. The Sensible Energy System+ is an interactive fabrication process of virtual and real coexistence created by combining the already-existing technology, the prototype fabrication machine, and SENS. This process analyzes each step of the fabrication process and energy, fits it into the computing system mode to control the prototype fabrication machine, and reduces the problem between virtual and physical fabrication and energy consumption.

Design of optimal ecosystem monitoring networks: hotspot detection and biodiversity patterns	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Value of spatial information; Monitoring network; Species richness; Multiresolution texture; Kullback-Leibler divergence	TRI-NATIONAL FRONTIER; ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE; PROTECTED AREAS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SYSTEMIC RISK; OPTIMIZATION; INFORMATION; COMPLEXITY; CONSERVATION; STABILITY	Effective monitoring of ecosystems is crucial for assessing and possibly anticipating shifts, quantifying ecosystem services, and optimal decision making based on shifts and services. The selection of monitoring sites is typically suboptimal following local stakeholder or research interests that do not allow to capture ecosystem patterns and dynamics as a whole. The design of optimal monitoring network is crucial for the accurate determination of biodiversity patterns of ecosystems. A novel model for the design of optimal monitoring networks for biodiversity based on the concept of the value of information (VoI) is proposed. The VoI is assigned to species richness that is the economically and ecologically valuable metric. As a case study the trinational frontier ecosystem among Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia is considered for the model. A multiresolution texture-based model estimates species richness and turnover on satellite imagery calibrated on different sets of information coming from forest plot data organized in network topologies. The optimal monitoring network is the network that minimizes the integrated VoI defined as the variation of the VoI in the 28 years considered. This is equivalent to minimize the sum of the species turnover of the ecosystem. The small world network is identified as the optimal and most resilient monitoring network whose nodes are the hotspots of species richness. The hotspots are identified as the sites whose VoI is the highest for the whole period considered. Hence, the hotspots are the most valuable communities for inferring biodiversity patterns and the most ecologically/economically valuable according to the richness-resilience hypothesis. Most hotspots are honored by the small world network that can be thought as the "backbone" ecological network of the ecosystem. The small world monitoring network has an accuracy similar to 50 % higher than other network topologies in predicting biodiversity patterns. This network has the highest VoI at any time step and scale considered; thus, it guarantees to track changes of ecosystems in space and time. The network that results from the optimal trade-off between data value with their uncertainty and relevance, has deep implications for understanding ecosystem function and for management decisions. The model allows to include preferences for ecosystem communities by using differential weights on the VoI of these communities, and economic constraints that limit the extension of the network. Because of the optimal integration of environmental, social, and economical factors the model allows a sustainable monitoring and planning of biodiversity for the future.

Given these possible complications, routine communication about childbearing between women with PKD and their treating team is important. A question prompt list (QPL), a structured list of questions used by patients during consultations with healthcare providers, may be beneficial in assisting women with PKD to discuss their childbearing concerns with, and seek related information from, their treating team. The aims of this study were to co-design a QPL about pregnancy and childbearing for women with PKD, and evaluate its comprehensibility, salience, and acceptability.MethodsAn exploratory sequential mixed-methods study of women of reproductive age with PKD living in Australia, using an experience-based co-design approach with two phases. Women were recruited from a metropolitan public health service and via social media and invited to complete an anonymous online survey about the development of the PKD QPL (phase one) and participate in an online discussion group about its refinement (phase two).ResultsSixteen women completed the development survey and seven participated in the evaluation discussion group. Participants reported that women with PKD would value and use a QPL to prompt discussions with and seek further information about pregnancy and childbearing from their healthcare providers. Women identified four main topics for the QPL: 'thinking about having a baby', 'pregnancy', 'my medications' and 'after my baby is born'. Within each section a series of questions was developed. Based on the findings, a QPL about pregnancy and childbearing for women with PKD was co-designed.ConclusionsWomen with PKD often find it difficult to access information and have discussions with their health care providers about pregnancy and childbearing. The PKD QPL co-designed in this study was perceived to be an acceptable tool which will, from the perspectives of participants, assist women with PKD to access information more easily about pregnancy, childbearing and PKD; ask more targeted questions of their treating team; and make informed childbearing decisions.

Although this capacity has been linked to the default mode network (DMN), it remains unclear how interactions between the nodes of this network give rise to particular mental experiences during spontaneous thought. One hypothesis is that the core of the DMN integrates information from medial and lateral temporal lobe memory systems, which represent different aspects of knowledge. Individual differences in the connectivity between temporal lobe regions and the default mode network core would then predict differences in the content and form of people's spontaneous thoughts. This study tested this hypothesis by examining the relationship between seed-based functional connectivity and the contents of spontaneous thought recorded in a laboratory study several days later. Variations in connectivity from both medial and lateral temporal lobe regions was associated with different patterns of spontaneous thought and these effects converged on an overlapping region in the posterior cingulate cortex. We propose that the posterior core of the DMN acts as a representational hub that integrates information represented in medial and lateral temporal lobe and this process is important in determining the content and form of spontaneous thought.

Background: Novel teaching methods have been explored as alternatives to traditional approaches. One such strategy is the implementation of escape-room-based techniques, which have been used as an inventive educational approach in nursing. However, there is limited information available on specific applications, such as in maternity education. Design: The study conducted a quasi-experimental design during two semesters of an academic year (i.e., the 2021-2022 academic year). The study was conducted at a university, with participants enrolled in a maternity course. Methods: The experimental group engaged in an online game-based escape room learning activity during the pregnancy assessment session of their maternity course, while the control group learned with a traditional teaching approach. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the performances of the two groups. Results: Findings from the experimental group suggested that incorporating an online game-based escape room approach into the learning process enhanced students' learning performance, problem-solving skills and critical thinking skills. Additionally, students expressed a consensus that learning through the online game-based escape room approach added enjoyment to the learning experience. Conclusions: Maternity escape rooms" emerged as an online game-based approach that effectively stimulated nursing students and can serve as a practical resource for engaging in maternity care learning.

We should <i>totally</i> open a restaurant: How optimism and overconfidence affect beliefs	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Subjective beliefs; Overconfidence; Optimism; Information; Experiments	EXPECTATIONS; INFORMATION; CHOICE; OVEROPTIMISM; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; UTILITY; BIASES; IMAGE; MONEY	Wishful thinking, defined as the tendency to over-estimate the probability of high-payoff outcomes, is a widely-documented phenomenon that can affect decision-making across numerous domains, including finance, management, and entrepreneurship. We design an experiment to distinguish and test the relationship between two easily-confounded biases, optimism and overconfidence, both of which can contribute to wishful thinking. We find that optimism and overconfidence are positively correlated at the individual level and that both help to explain wishful thinking. These findings suggest that ignoring optimism results in an upwardly biased estimate of the role of overconfidence in explaining wishful thinking. To illustrate this point, we show that 30% of our observations are misclassified as under- or overconfident if optimism is omitted from the analysis. Our findings have potential implications for the design of information interventions since how agents incorporate information depends on whether the bias is ego-related.

J	Toker, Z				Toker, Zerrin			Teachers' Reflective thoughts and Perceptions About Change in the Process of Adaptation to the International Curriculum	EGITIM VE BILIM-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE			English	Article						Teachers' perception of change; International Baccalaureate; Middle Years Program; Reflective thinking	INQUIRY	The targeted student profile in the changing world is now aimed at being an individual who plays an active role in their learning process, investigates, questions, thinks and discovers rather than a passive recipient who acquires the information that the teacher understands. Such a student profile requires an understanding of teaching that aims to be equipped with a variety of competencies, rather than the transfer of information that can be acquired in a very short period of time from many sources. Being able to adapt to the ever-evolving and changing dynamics of 21st century, in order to train students equipped with century skills, it is inevitable that teachers will be constantly engaged in reflective thinking practices and guide their own development. This study aims to examine the reflective thinking processes of teachers in a school that is involved in the International Baccalaureate (IB) Middle Years Program (MYP) process adopted and implemented by many schools in Turkey, to reveal how they perceive change in this process and to examine the action plans they develop in the process of change. The study was carried out with 16 participants from different branches. Teachers from branches of Physical Education, Mathematics, Social Studies, Science, Turkish, English Teaching, Technology-Design, Music, Visual Arts, working at IB MYP School were participated in the study. In the study, a semi-structured interview form was used as a data collection tool. Descriptive analysis was used. It is seen that teachers' perceptions of change are clustered within certain frameworks, independent of the branch. The main ones are teaching approach, professional development practices, curriculum, philosophy, planning, collaboration, teaching process.

Prior to its implementation in schools, we conducted a study among 98 prospective science teachers to examine the quality of location based questions and participants' epistemic views. Data were collected through encoding of questions' quality, participants' grades, and semi-structured interviews. The findings indicated medium results for the quality of location-based questions, with multimedia design as the weakest feature. The participants' early experience in exam-writing and gender were found as significant predictors of the quality of questions. In addition, the data indicated a significant relationship between the questions' quality and participants' technological and pedagogical knowledge. Four competencies were identified with reference to the educational importance of location-based questions: contextualization, creativity, critical thinking, and information and communication technology (ICT) literacy. The current study underlines the importance of location-based questions as a form of learning and alternative assessment.

Integration adds complexity, requiring careful assessment of effects on a range of key system functions from demand creation and service delivery to oversight and governance. Through an innovative design process, we selected approaches to increase FTMs' PPFP use through existing health systems. We generated programmatic options and then sought to select approaches based on (1) potential impact on FTMs' PPFP uptake and (2) potential to institutionalize in the health system. The latter represented an innovation in addressing management systems' drivers of scalability and sustainability; to accomplish it, we developed a participatory design process to assess the potential of an approach to be institutionalized in a specific context. We adapted a management systems theory, the Viable System Model (VSM), which presents 5 essential organizational functions and the relations required between them to improve the viability (performance and institutionalization) of organizational systems. Drawing from the VSM, we developed a process for reviewing the effects of proposed approaches on provider workload, client flow, infrastructure, revisions to guidelines and job descriptions, coordination and management, and information systems. The VSM provided a structure to identify potential displacement of capacity in the health system and mitigate often neglected organizational challenges that compromise institutionalization. The process informed the elimination of approaches with potential for impact but that had deal-breakers to institutionalization, such as increased workload or shifted job descriptions, in the Bangladeshi context. For the selected approaches, consideration of systems elements fostered discussion of expected risks to institutionalization, highlighting needed mitigation efforts and monitoring during implementation.

Reasoning, as an important part of artificial intel-ligence, is an open and challenging problem to be solved. In this paper, memristive hopfield neural network is designed to realize reasoning. The designed circuit consists of four modules, namely a signal processing module, an iterator module, a signal input module and a signal output module. The signal processing module performs iterative operations under the control of the iterator module, so that the output signals of memristive hopfield neural network can converge to the final states. Reasoning is one of the basic forms of thinking, and is the process of drawing result from one or several given conditions. A guessing game for athletes is completed by the designed circuit which can reason the name of the athlete from incomplete information. The simulation results verify the feasibility of the circuit for reasoning.

J	Foulkes, L; Stapley, E				Foulkes, Lucy; Stapley, Emily			Want to improve school mental health interventions? Ask young people what they actually think	JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION			English	Review						Intervention; mental health; qualitative; school	QUALITATIVE EVALUATION; PROGRAM; MINDFULNESS; UNIVERSAL; ANXIETY; FRIENDS; SELF	As part of the recent 'therapeutic turn' in education, schools are now commonly seen as a place for mental health guidance and support. This often involves interventions-special curricula of lessons or activities (e.g. counselling sessions), which aim to either prevent mental health problems or manage those that have already started. Running these interventions in schools makes good sense: rates of mental health problems in young people are rising, and large numbers can be reached in this setting. However, evidence for the effectiveness of such interventions has been mixed. One way to improve how helpful and useful they are, we argue here, would be to ask young people themselves what they think about these programmes. This involves collecting qualitative data: gathering in-depth information about young people's experiences and opinions, rather than relying solely on numerical data, such as rating scales. The small number of existing published qualitative studies in this area show that many young people do find these interventions helpful, but there are issues that warrant careful attention. For example, some young people can feel worried or vulnerable during classroom-based exercises, and others don't see how the interventions are relevant for their own lives. Here, we explore this literature and recommend two avenues for future work: ask more young people what they think of existing interventions, and get them involved in the design of new ones. Together, this will put young people's voices at the heart of school-based mental health interventions.

One approach uses the metaphor of a "handprint," complementing the notion of environmental footprints, which have been widely adopted for impact measurement and accounting. We analyze this idea by establishing core principles of handprint thinking: Handprint encourages actions with positive impacts and connects to analyses of footprint reductions but adds value to them and addresses the issue of what action should be taken. We also identify five key questions that need to be addressed and decisions that need to be made in performing a (potentially quantitative) handprint assessment, related to scoping of the improvement to be made, how it is achieved, and how credit is assigned, taking into account constraints on action. A case study of the potential water footprint reduction of an average Finn demonstrates how handprint thinking can be a natural extension of footprint reduction analyses.

However, few of researches on engineering emergency decision involved with heterogeneous multi attributes, and the static and non-inferential analytical methods ignored the linkage of the dual information between objective characteristics and preference information, which failed to effectively quantify the attribute weights and the similarity between cases and thus are difficult to make a valid decision for the dynamic decision-making environment. Based on case-based reasoning (CBR), a novel emergency decision model embedding with the grey relational analysis (GRA) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithms, is proposed to help engineering emergency decision. Specially, the global indicator is derived by grey incidence degree for the similarity measure between heterogeneous multi-attribute cases from the perspective of system space, along with the GWO-based relative entropy method considering dual information correlation is designed for more reasonable weight allocation. Hence, the proposed model can exploit previous experiences and retrieve the optimal alternative for the future engineering emergency with heterogeneous multi attributes by imitating human thinking process. Finally, a real case in a water transfer project and comparison with three popular methods are conducted to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model.

LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							KNOWLEDGE CONSTRUCTION; CRITICAL THINKING; SUPPORT GROUPS; COMMUNITIES; INFORMATION; SEMIOTICS; BEHAVIOR; SATISFACTION; DISCOURSE; SEARCH	The online health discussion (OHD) has increasingly become an important component in the practice of health informatics service, and many health users have gained benefits through OHD. Few studies have tried to answer how people obtain benefits from OHD. As a new type of online health information, OHD is composed of multiple messages with a discourse structure. By referring to Peirce' semiotics, a theoretical model of the relationship of OHD with multiply meanings (i.e., discourse structure and health knowledge) and health users' perceived benefits (PB) was developed. 1248 OHD units were collected, and the main findings were obtained. (1) The number of discussion chains has a crucial effect on PB. (2) Health knowledge related to OHD produces indirect effects on PB. This work enriches extant literature by empirically revealing multilevel meanings of OHD and their roles. Related findings can be used to explore improvements for designing of OHD.

Design Randomised trial with three groups. Data collected at start of radiotherapy, one week later (when information provided), three weeks later, and three months later. Participants 525 patients started radical radiotherapy; 438 completed follow up. Interventions Two groups were offered information via computer (personalised or general information, or both) with open access to computer thereafter; the third group was offered a selection of information booklets. Outcomes Patients' views and preferences, use of computer and information, and psychological status; doctors' perceptions; cost of interventions. Results More patients offered the personalised information said that they had learnt something new thought the information was relevant, used the computer again, and showed their computer printouts to others. There were no major differences in doctors' perceptions of patients. More of the general computer group were anxious at three months. With an electronic patient record system, in the long run the personalised information system would cost no more than the general system. Full access to booklets cost twice as much as the general system. Conclusions Patients preferred computer systems that provided information from their medical records to systems that just provided general information. This has implications for the design and implementation of electronic patient record systems and reliance on general sources of patient information.

Hyperbaric oxygen brain injury treatment (HOBIT) trial: a multifactor design with response adaptive randomization and longitudinal modeling	PHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						Bayesian adaptive design; multiple factors; phase II clinical trial	CLINICAL-TRIALS; IMPUTATION; DRUG	The goals of phase II clinical trials are to gain important information about the performance of novel treatments and decide whether to conduct a larger phase III trial. This can be complicated in cases when the phase II trial objective is to identify a novel treatment having several factors. Such multifactor treatment scenarios can be explored using fixed sample size trials. However, the alternative design could be response adaptive randomization with interim analyses and additionally, longitudinal modeling whereby more data could be used in the estimation process. This combined approach allows a quicker and more responsive adaptation to early estimates of later endpoints. Such alternative clinical trial designs are potentially more powerful, faster, and smaller than fixed randomized designs. Such designs are particularly challenging, however, because phase II trials tend to be smaller than subsequent confirmatory phase III trials. The phase II trial may need to explore a large number of treatment variations to ensure that the efficacy of optimal clinical conditions is not overlooked. Adaptive trial designs need to be carefully evaluated to understand how they will perform and to take full advantage of their potential benefits. This manuscript discusses a Bayesian response adaptive randomization design with a longitudinal model that uses a multifactor approach for predicting phase III study success via the phase II data. The approach is based on an actual clinical trial design for the hyperbaric oxygen brain injury treatment trial. Specific details of the thought process and the models informing the trial design are provided. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We also argue that it is insufficient to only focus on the technology of ML. We should also design the broader socio-technical system within which the ML model is to be deployed. We draw on philosophers and systems thinkers to offer two additional steps to current ML design process models. These new phases focus on a) understanding the subjectivity of the data scientists involved in ML design and b) holistically examining the wider social context within which the ML model is to be implemented. We provide insight into how to implement the additional steps in the ML design process. The proposed additions help address issues such as the lack of explainability/transparency in ML models, bias in ML, and difficulty in managing human-ML hybrids.

It is advantageous for relevant scholars to deepen their understanding of this academic field from a bibliometrics view to grasp the future directions better. Design/methodology/approach Structuring a citation network with the processed data set containing 866 papers and relevant information collected from Web of Science (WoS). Conducting review analyses aiming at the main paths that are extracted from the above citation network. Findings There are two different evolution paths in LSCM field, i.e. improving corporate sustainability performance through combining lean and green practices, and seeking the balance between lean and agility to structure leagile supply chain for specific industries. LSCM research studies mainly focus on five aspects: (1) establishment and development of LSCM theory; (2) structuration of lean supply chain; (3) research studies of the relationship between LSCM and corporate performance; (4) supply chain evaluation system; and (5) review and vista of LSCM field. The intersection of two knowledge evolute routes would be Industry 4.0, which is an integrated theory system combining lean, agility, green and other supply chain thinking. Research limitations/implications The data set collected from WoS cannot contain all the research studies about LSCM is the main research limitation. Sustainability, as represented by environmental performance, will continue to be a major pursuit of this field. Integrating LSCM in Industry 4.0 will be the next hotspot in LSCM field. Practical implications Providing the main research contents and common methods of LSCM field. It is conducive to deepening the understanding of relevant practitioners and scholars to LSCM field from a dynamic perspective. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, it is the first time to reveal the knowledge diffuse trajectories of LSCM under different view with main path analysis. This study is unique that it provides a new view to understand the field of LSCM.

Knowing that Audit & Feedback (A & F) dashboards are an effective tool and are used as quality improvement interventions, we aimed to develop such dashboards personalized for dental providers which could allow them to monitor their own opioid prescribing performance. Methods: In this paper we report on the process for designing the A & F dashboards for dentists which were developed by using an iterative human-centered design process. The results obtained from each iteration were used to enrich the information needs analyses, provide function testing, and guide the design decisions of the next iteration. Results: Engaging dentists in the development and refinement of the dashboards while using the think-aloud protocol for user-testing, provided rapid feedback and identified areas that were confusing and needed either a redesign or additional explanatory content. The final version of dashboards consisted of displaying necessary information through easy to interpret visualizations and interactive features. These included providing access to current national and organizational prescribing guidelines, displaying changes in individual prescribing behavior over time, comparing individual prescribing rate to peer group rate and target rate, displaying procedure specific prescribing, integrating patient reported post-operative dental pain experience and providing navigation and interpretation tips for users. The dashboards were easy to learn and understand for the dentists and were deemed as worth using often in dental practice. Conclusion: Our research was able to demonstrate the creation of useful and usable A & F dashboards using data from electronic dental records and patient surveys, for dentists to effectively monitor their opioid prescribing behavior. Efficacy of the dashboards will be tested in future work.

J	Sasson, I; Dori, YJ				Sasson, Irit; Dori, Yehudit Judy			A three-attribute transfer skills framework - part II: applying and assessing the model in science education	CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article							HIGH-SCHOOL CHEMISTRY; LEARNING-ENVIRONMENT; CHEMICAL EDUCATION; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; PHYSICS CLASSES; GIRLS INTEREST; CHALLENGES; STRATEGY; BIOLOGY	In an era in which information is rapidly growing and changing, it is very important to teach with the goal of students' engagement in life-long learning in mind. This can partially be achieved by developing transferable thinking skills. In our previous paper - Part I, we conducted a review of the transfer literature and suggested a three-attribute transfer skills framework presented graphically as a cube. The goals of this paper - Part II are (a) to investigate the application of the three-attribute transfer skills framework by conducting two studies; and (b) to demonstrate the value of the framework as a tool for design of assignments and assessment of students' transfer skills. In this paper, we have applied the three-attribute transfer skills framework to design assignments and to assess middle and high school students. In order to achieve the first goal we conducted two studies: (1) investigating high school chemistry students in a computerized laboratory setting, and (2) exploring middle school students who were exposed to a science enrichment program. Study 1 took a case-based chemistry approach and included assessment of high school honor chemistry students' transfer skills. In Study 2, we evaluated the transfer skills of ninth grade students who had participated in a science enrichment academic program with emphasis on physics and we compared boys to girls. Findings of Study 1 indicated an increase in students' far transfer skill as expressed by the progress students made in transferring knowledge from chemistry to other science domains and by using more chemistry understanding levels in their responses. In Study 2, we found that the near transfer skill of middle school boys was significantly higher than the same skill among girls who participated in the same enrichment program. Both parts, the review and the three-attribute transfer skills framework (previous paper - Part I) and the research (this paper -Part II), contribute to narrowing the gap between the theory of transfer, empirical research, and the practice of transfer in science classrooms.

Structured Singular Value Analysis for Spintronics Network Information Transfer Control	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL			English	Article						Quantum mechanics; robust control; sensitivity; analysis; spin polarized transport; spintronics; uncertain systems		Control laws for selective transfer of information encoded in excitations of a quantum network, based on shaping the energy landscape using time-invariant, spatially-varying bias fields, can be successfully designed by using numerical optimization. Such control laws, already departing from classicality by replacing closed-loop asymptotic stability with alternative notions of localization, have the intriguing property that for all practical purposes they achieve the upper bound on the fidelity, yet the (logarithmic) sensitivity of the fidelity to such structured perturbation as spin coupling errors and bias field leakages is nearly vanishing. Here, these differential sensitivity results are extended to large structured variations using mu-design tools to reveal a crossover region in the space of controllers where objectives usually thought to be conflicting are actually concordant.

A comprehensive scoping review to identify standards for the development of health information resources on the internet	PLOS ONE			English	Review							WORLD-WIDE-WEB; READABILITY FORMULA; QUALITY; INSTRUMENTS; KNOWLEDGE; SITES; TRUST	Background Online health information, if evidence-based and unbiased, can improve patients' and care-givers' health knowledge and assist them in disease management and health care decisionmaking. Objective To identify standards for the development of health information resources on the internet for patients. Methods We searched in MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for publications describing evaluation instruments for websites providing health information. Eligible instruments were identified by three independent reviewers and disagreements resolved by consensus. Items reported were extracted and categorized into seven domains (accuracy, completeness and comprehensiveness, technical elements, design and aesthetics, usability, accessibility, and readability) that were previously thought to be a minimum requirement for websites. Results One hundred eleven articles met inclusion criteria, reporting 92 evaluation instruments (1609 items). We found 74 unique items that we grouped into the seven domains. For the accuracy domain, one item evaluated information provided in concordance with current guidelines. For completeness and comprehensiveness, 18 items described the disease with respect to various topics such as etiology or therapy, among others. For technical elements, 27 items evaluated disclosure of authorship, sponsorship, affiliation, editorial process, feedback process, privacy, and data protection. For design and aesthetics, 10 items evaluated consistent layout and relevant graphics and images. For usability, 10 items evaluated ease of navigation and functionality of internal search engines. For accessibility, five items evaluated the availability of websites to people with audiovisual disabilities. For readability, three items evaluated conversational writing style and use of a readability tool to determine the reading level of the text. Conclusion We identified standards for the development of online patient health information. This proposed instrument can serve as a guideline to develop and improve how health information is presented on the internet.

Teaching students to explain the pathophysiology of diseases to lay audiences with a scaffold that supports student choice	ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						authentic assessment; explaining disease; science communication	COMMUNICATE; PHYSIOLOGY	Expert educators in science argue that science graduates are often lacking skills in effectively communicating scientific information to lay audiences. To address this, we designed a project, Communicating Disease, for final-year undergraduate human pathophysiology students. Students chose a disease, a relevant nonscientific target audience, and a mode of communication and produced a communique designed to educate the audience on the pathophysiology of the disease. Separately, students justified their choice of disease and target audience. Upon completion of the project, students completed an anonymous questionnaire, and their submitted work was analyzed. Our study demonstrated that students thought it was important to learn how to effectively communicate science to a lay audience and felt that the project had supported them in developing knowledge and skills that enabled them to do so. Students were adequately challenged, and most students gave their best effort to the project, indicating a high level of engagement. Evaluation of student performance was consistent with the students' own perceptions and showed that most students communicated the pathophysiology effectively to the target audience and appropriately justified their choice of disease and target audience. Nevertheless, opportunities for improvement with some aspects of communication, production quality, and creativity were evident. This model is suitable for a range of scientific disciplines to engage students in developing their ability to communicate scientific information to lay audiences-a skill that it can be argued is vital for improving the scientific literacy of our community at large.

Aim: To understand the cognitive needs of nurses and physicians and determine how these needs should influence the design of healthcare interfaces. Design of study: A qualitative and quantitative study that compares how nurses and physicians comprehend patient information. Setting: Twenty-four registered nurses and twenty-four physicians working in the specialties of gastrointestinal or internal medicine. Methods: Each clinician reviewed two mock electronic medical records and summarized the cases using a think-aloud protocol. All verbalizations were coded for medical and conceptual information. Results: The nurses included a larger mean proportion (p < 0.001) of recalls than did the physicians. As compared to the nurses, the physicians included a statistically significant (p < 0.001) larger mean proportion of inferences, conditional statements, and interventions. The nurses concentrated on functional problems, whereas the physicians focused on diagnosis, treatment, and management. Conclusion: The main cognitive differences between the physicians and the nurses are explained through the differences in their practice models. Therefore, healthcare IT must develop separate interfaces for each discipline to address their unique needs. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, LL; Nhung, MT				Liu, Lulu; Minh Tien Nhung			The Application of VR/AR Technology in Graphic Design Based on zSpace	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article							VISUALIZATION; UNIQUENESS	The arrival of the information age has promoted the rapid development of information technology, and the birth of VR and AR technology has brought many changes to the emerging technology fields. R&D and progress of VR and AR technology highlight outstanding achievements in the information age. In the future, VR and AR technologies will bring huge economic benefits to related industries, and at the same time, they will lead the future of related industries. Virtual reality technology has evolved for decades since its birth. As a new technology, VR has greatly changed people's daily life. No matter in the field of graphic design or interior design, it can be used as a special technical means to effectively penetrate between abstract thinking and entity, thus promoting the change of people's design thinking. Therefore, VR technology has been paid more and more attention in recent years, so it is widely used. With the strengthening of China's national strength, VR/AR technology based on zSpace has been more and more applied to the field of graphic design. Therefore, this paper takes VR/AR technology based on zSpace as the research object, analyzes the application of VR/AR technology in graphic design in detail, sorts out the advantages and existing problems of VR/AR technology in graphic design field, and discusses the role of emerging technologies in graphic design field, hoping to provide reference and help for the improvement of virtual reality technology in graphic design field.

However, service users often feel they're not fully involved and direct access to users' own electronic care plans in the community can be an obstacle. To address this, an electronic care pathway tool (CPT) was co-designed by service users, staff and software developers, to facilitate co-production of care and crisis plans. Aims: To investigate the feasibility and acceptability of the pilot implementation of the CPT in professionals' practice to co-produce care plans and enable efficient working. Method: Qualitative interviews with fifteen mental health practitioners, and five service development/management staff. Normalisation process theory, which outlines the social processes involved in implementing technology, and co-production theory, informed interviews and data analysis. Results: Multiple factors influenced CPT usage, including people's views of technology, practitioners' relationships with service users, service users' mental health needs, and their capacity for reflective thinking. The CPT's visual and interactive features could enable co-production of care plans. The CPT supported practitioners' efficiency, but its features did not easily streamline with electronic patient records. Conclusions: CPT interactive touchpoints supported service users' therapeutic reflection and facilitated care planning involvement. Information technology system interoperability was an obstacle.

Background Increasing rates of chronic disease lead to health care being delivered by multiple care providers often at distributed geographic locations. As a way of increasing the availability of patient information to care providers our project will trial a PHF. Patients carry these files to doctors' appointments where clinicians record data for other doctors or the patient. Increasing the availability of patient information is anticipated to enhance the safety and quality of care delivery and improve health outcomes. Study design Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 patients. Participants were evenly distributed in terms of gender, aged 60 years or greater and visited at least two specialists and one general practitioner. Findings In this exploratory study, patients who were currently active in decision making about their own health already recorded some health information. They were receptive to carrying their information and thought they should take some responsibility for their health. Patients who were more passive in making decisions about their health did not perceive a need to carry their own information and felt that their doctors communicated adequately. Conclusion Patient-held health files provide an opportunity for patients to access their health information. Such files have the potential to improve health outcomes for patients who adopt both active and passive roles in relation to their own health and engaging with their health information.

A history professor and archivist working at a university that predominantly produces STEM majors have partnered to teach these students by utilizing the special collections related to engineering, innovation, and discovery in classroom work and assignments. This Critical Participation article presents the model of the 'archive as laboratory' to facilitate critical inquiry, introduce archival literacy to scientists and engineers, and expand students' concept of information sources. Students gain an understanding that research questions can be addressed through multiple kinds of evidence that the archives is uniquely situated to provide. The immersive learning experience is enhanced by coursework that incorporates foundational theories and approaches from Science & Technology Studies. The lab model engages the archive as a hands-on workspace and a place where students can practice research skills. Engaging the archive as a laboratory fosters inquiry and critical thinking, and connects histories of innovation, problem identification, and design practice to students' own majors and their future careers. It is relevant when a problem requires original solutions not found in existing manuals, textbooks, or online platforms.

This has provided an impetus for organizations to adopt and perfect data analytic functions (e.g. data science, predictive analytics, and big data) in order to enhance supply chain processes and, ultimately, performance. However, management decisions informed by the use of these data analytic methods are only as good as the data on which they are based. In this paper, we introduce the data quality problem in the context of supply chain management (SCM) and propose methods for monitoring and controlling data quality. In addition to advocating for the importance of addressing data quality in supply chain research and practice, we also highlight interdisciplinary research topics based on complementary theory.

J	Yao, T				Yao, T			Bioinformatics for the genomic sciences and towards systems biology. Japanese activities in the post-genome era	PROGRESS IN BIOPHYSICS & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Review						bioinformatics; systems biology; genome; protein; RIKEN; Japan	PROTEIN-STRUCTURE PREDICTION; DRUG DISCOVERY; COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS; DATABASE; SEQUENCE; IDENTIFICATION; GENES; FOLD; INFORMATICS; ANNOTATION	The knowledge gleaned from genome sequencing and post-genome analyses is having a very significant impact on a whole range of life sciences and their applications. 'Genome-wide analysis' is a good keyword to represent this tendency. Thanks to innovations in high-throughput measurement technologies and information technologies, genome-wide analysis is becoming available in a broad range of research fields from DNA sequences, gene and protein expressions, protein structures and interactions, to pathways or networks analysis. In fact, the number of research targets has increased by more than two orders in recent years and we should change drastically the attitude to research activities. The scope and speed of research activities are expanding and the field of bioinformatics is playing an important role. In parallel with the data-driven research approach that focuses on speedy handling and analyzing of the huge amount of data, a new approach is gradually gaining power. This is a 'model-driven research' approach, that incorporates biological modeling in its research framework. Computational simulations of biological processes play a pivotal role. By modeling and simulating, this approach aims at predicting and even designing the dynamic behaviors of complex biological systems, which is expected to make rapid progress in life science researches and lead to meaningful applications to various fields such as health care, food supply and improvement of environment. Genomic sciences are now advancing as great frontiers of research and applications in the 21st century. This article starts with surveying the general progress of bioinformatics (Section 1), and describes Japanese activities in bioinformatics (Section 2). In Section 3, 1 will introduce recent developments in Systems Biology which I think will become more important in the future. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Demirjian, W; Powelson, M; Canfield, S				Demirjian, Wesley; Powelson, Matthew; Canfield, Stephen			Design of Track-Type Climbing Robots Using Dry Adhesives and Compliant Suspension for Scalable Payloads	JOURNAL OF MECHANISMS AND ROBOTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						manufacturing; mobile robots; robot design; dry adhesives	VERTICAL SURFACES; WAALBOT	Climbing robots offer advanced motion capabilities to perform inspection, manufacturing, or rescue tasks. Climbing requires the robot to generate adhering forces with the climbing surface. Dry adhesives present a category of adhesion that could be advantageous for climbing a variety of surfaces. Current literature shows climbing robots using dry adhesives typically exhibit minimal payloads and are considered useful for tasks involving lightweight sensors, such as surveillance. However, dry adhesives routinely demonstrate adhering pressures in the range of 20-50 kPa, suggesting that a small robot (3 x 30 cm footprint, for example) could theoretically have a significant payload (in the order of 18-45 kg). Existing designs demonstrate small payloads primarily because they fail to distribute the adhesion forces over the entire adhering region available to these robots. Further, existing design methods do not demonstrate scalability of payload-to-vehicle size but, in fact, indicate such robots are not scalable (Gorb et al., 2007, "Insects Did It First: A Micropatterned Adhesive Tape for Robotic Applications," Bioinspir. Biomim., 2(4), pp. 117-125.). This paper presents a design procedure for track-type climbing robots that use dry adhesives to generate tractive forces and a passive suspension that distributes the climbing loads over the track in a preferred manner. This procedure simultaneously considers the behavior of both the adhesive material at the track-surface interface and the distribution of the adhesive forces over the full contact surface. The paper will demonstrate that dry-adhesive-based climbing robots can be designed to achieve high payloads and are scalable, thus enabling them to be used in applications previously thought to be impossible with dry adhesives.

Designs and technologies for plasma-facing wall protection in EU DEMO	NUCLEAR FUSION			English	Article						DEMO reactor; plasma-facing components; limiter engineering design; critical heat flux; PFC engineering; wall protection	SIMULATIONS; PROGRESS	The EU DEMO plasma is almost completely enveloped by large breeding blanket segments for tritium breeding and power extraction. Shaping of the blanket plasma-facing wall in 3D may prove to be essential, but this strategy alone is not sufficient to protect against anticipated transient plasma events. The high heat flux wall-limiter approach used in ITER is not thought to be viable in a tritium self-sufficient power reactor, and so in EU DEMO wall protection using discrete limiters is pursued. Two types of discrete limiter are described in this paper. One is an equatorial port limiter designed to handle the power during the plasma start-up phase, making use of water-cooled tungsten/CuCrZr monoblock technology. The second is the upper limiter, featuring a plasma-facing component designed specifically for extreme transient loading due to a vertical displacement event. The heat flux channelling and thermal barrier features of this design are shown to considerably reduce CuCrZr pipe temperature, and so reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failure. A preliminary neutronic calculation has shown that the impact of these discrete limiters on overall tritium breeding ratio is relatively low.	[Barrett, T. R.; Chuilon, B.; Kovari, M.; Hernandez, D.

Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis	BMJ OPEN			English	Review							ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; ELECTROCARDIOGRAM INTERPRETATION; INTERPRETATION SKILLS; LEARNING-THEORIES; 12-LEAD ELECTROCARDIOGRAM; DELIBERATE PRACTICE; FLIPPED CLASSROOM; CRITICAL THINKING; GUIDE; IMPACT	Introduction Although ECG interpretation is an essential skill in clinical medicine, medical students and residents often lack ECG competence. Novel teaching methods are increasingly being implemented and investigated to improve ECG training. Computer-assisted instruction is one such method under investigation; however, its efficacy in achieving better ECG competence among medical students and residents remains uncertain. Methods and analysis This article describes the protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis that will compare the effectiveness of computer-assisted instruction with other teaching methods used for the ECG training of medical students and residents. Only studies with a comparative research design will be considered. Articles will be searched for in electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center, Africa-Wide Information and Teacher Reference Center). In addition, we will review citation indexes and conduct a grey literature search. Data extraction will be done on articles that met the predefined eligibility criteria. A descriptive analysis of the different teaching modalities will be provided and their educational impact will be assessed in terms of effect size and the modified version of Kirkpatrick framework for the evaluation of educational interventions. This systematic review aims to provide evidence as to whether computer-assisted instruction is an effective teaching modality for ECG training. It is hoped that the information garnered from this systematic review will assist in future curricular development and improve ECG training. Ethics and dissemination As this research is a systematic review of published literature, ethical approval is not required. The results will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement and will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. The protocol and systematic review will be included in a PhD dissertation. PROSPERO registration number CRD42017067054; Pre-results.

Life sciences evidence from Dryad	ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Data sharing; Research data management; Citation analysis; Digital repository; Digital archive; Dryad	PRIMARY BIODIVERSITY DATA; EXPERIENCE; NEED	Purpose - Data sharing is widely thought to help research quality and efficiency. Data sharing mandates are increasingly being adopted by journals and the purpose of this paper is to assess whether they work. Design/methodology/approach - This study examines two evolutionary biology journals, Evolution and Heredity, that have data sharing mandates and make extensive use of Dryad. It uses a quantitative analysis of presence in Dryad, downloads and citations. Findings - Within both journals, data sharing seems to be complete, showing that the mandates work on a technical level. Low correlations (0.15-0.18) between data downloads and article citation counts for articles published in 2012 within these journals indicate a weak relationship between data sharing and research impact. An average of 40-55 data downloads per article after a few years suggests that some use is found for shared life sciences data. Research limitations/implications - The value of shared data uses is unclear. Practical implications - Data sharing mandates should be encouraged as an effective strategy. Originality/value - This is the first analysis of the effectiveness of data sharing mandates.

US adult tobacco users' absolute harm perceptions of traditional and alternative tobacco products, information-seeking behaviors, and (mis)beliefs about chemicals in tobacco products	ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Article						Tobacco; Absolute harm perceptions; Information seeking; HINTS	SMOKELESS TOBACCO; RISK PERCEPTIONS; RESPONSE RATES; CIGARETTE USE; SMOKING; SMOKERS; PREVALENCE; PATTERNS; BELIEFS; ATTITUDES	Introduction: Harm perceptions about tobacco products may influence initiation, continued use, and cessation efforts. We assessed associations between adult traditional tobacco product use and absolute harm perceptions of traditional and alternative tobacco products. We also described the topics individuals looked for during their last search for information, their beliefs about chemicals in cigarettes/cigarette smoke, and how both relate to harm perceptions. Methods: We ran multivariable models with jackknife replicate weights to analyze data from the 2015 administration of the National Cancer Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey (N = 3376). Results: Compared to never users, individuals reported lower perceived levels of harm for products they use. Among current tobacco users, ethnicity, thinking about chemicals in tobacco, and information-seeking were all factors associated with tobacco product harm perceptions. In the full sample, some respondents reported searching for information about health effects and cessation and held misperceptions about the source of chemicals in tobacco. Conclusions: This study fills a gap in the literature by assessing the absolute harm perceptions of a variety of traditional and alternative tobacco products. Harm perceptions vary among tobacco products, and the relationship among tobacco use, information seeking, thoughts about chemicals in tobacco products, and harm perceptions is complex. Data suggest that some individuals search for information about health effects and cessation and hold misperceptions about chemicals in tobacco products. Future inquiry could seek to understand the mechanisms that contribute to forming harm perceptions and beliefs about chemicals in tobacco products. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the WFD does not describe in detail how member states should operationalize participation. The need for local experience and local understanding of collaborative governance (co-governance) processes remains. The WaterCoG project evaluated 11 local pilot schemes. Building on the participatory, qualitative evaluation of pilot schemes from Sweden, United Kingdom, Denmark, The Netherlands, and Germany, the authors take a closer look at how co-governance can improve water governance, how water managers can make best use of tools and knowledge, and how they can improve process designs. The results reflect how social learning and successful co-governance are linked. Social learning as a shared understanding of complex ecosystem and water-management issues can be supported with active stakeholder involvement and citizen science. As such, in co-governance processes, stakeholders need technical access to data and knowledge and a shared process memory. This enables them to develop a shared understanding and facilitates bringing together competing interests and finding new solutions. Participatory tools became part of successful processes by building trust and knowledge based on commitment. However, proficient process design and facilitation make these tools more effective.

J	Qu, XF; Zhu, FQ				Qu, Xingfu; Zhu, Fanqi			Construction of Rural Cultural Service System Based on Mobile Information System	MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								At present, the development of rural culture is gradually rising. Under the promotion of the sense of freedom and democracy, mobile information system also plays an important role in rural cultural services. This paper uses edge algorithm to build mobile information system, combined with rural cultural service elements, to carry out information construction for the people's needs of tourism, information, and belief culture in the development of rural China. In this paper, with the county or township service projects as the research content and 200 residents of a community as the research object, using the way of questionnaire to survey the respondents, online questionnaire feedback results received 186, the effective rate of 93%. This paper investigates the project support of mobile information system for rural cultural services and the satisfaction degree of residents' demand for various cultural resources. Research shows that the rural cultural service system based on mobile information system can improve the scope of cultural services. From the survey results, 65.53% of the people think that the cultural service system can reduce people's dependence on special cultural services, so as to obtain resources from the diversified information service system. 35.63% of the people said that the efficiency of cultural service system could be improved by more than 50% compared to that of offline cultural service. Others said that the rural cultural service system could basically meet their living needs. Therefore, whether from the perspective of cultural service or information system, the current rural cultural service mode and service process need to be constructed from the perspective of cultural service supply system reform.

J	Thibodeau, PH; Boroditsky, L				Thibodeau, Paul H.; Boroditsky, Lera			Metaphors We Think With: The Role of Metaphor in Reasoning	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COMPREHENSION; THOUGHT; TIME	The way we talk about complex and abstract ideas is suffused with metaphor. In five experiments, we explore how these metaphors influence the way that we reason about complex issues and forage for further information about them. We find that even the subtlest instantiation of a metaphor (via a single word) can have a powerful influence over how people attempt to solve social problems like crime and how they gather information to make "well-informed" decisions. Interestingly, we find that the influence of the metaphorical framing effect is covert: people do not recognize metaphors as influential in their decisions; instead they point to more "substantive" (often numerical) information as the motivation for their problem-solving decision. Metaphors in language appear to instantiate frame-consistent knowledge structures and invite structurally consistent inferences. Far from being mere rhetorical flourishes, metaphors have profound influences on how we conceptualize and act with respect to important societal issues. We find that exposure to even a single metaphor can induce substantial differences in opinion about how to solve social problems: differences that are larger, for example, than pre-existing differences in opinion between Democrats and Republicans.

However, little is known about the use of, attitudes toward, and activities regarding eHealth among the Japanese population. Objectives: This study aimed to measure the prevalence of Internet use for health-related information compared with other sources, and to examine the effects on user knowledge, attitudes, and activities with regard to Internet use for health-related information in Japan. We examined the extent of use via personal computers and cell phones. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a quasi-representative sample (N = 1200) of the Japanese general population aged 15-79 years in September 2007. The main outcome measures were (1) self-reported rates of Internet use in the past year to acquire health-related information and to contact health professionals, family, friends, and peers specifically for health-related purposes, and (2) perceived effects of Internet use on health care. Results: The prevalence of Internet use via personal computer for acquiring health-related information was 23.8% (286/1200) among those surveyed, whereas the prevalence via cell phone was 6% (77). Internet use via both personal computer and cell phone for communicating with health professionals, family, friends, or peers was not common. The Internet was used via personal computer for acquiring health-related information primarily by younger people, people with higher education levels, and people with higher household incomes. The majority of those who used the Internet for health care purposes responded that the Internet improved their knowledge or affected their lifestyle attitude, and that they felt confident in the health-related information they obtained from the Internet. However, less than one-quarter thought it improved their ability to manage their health or affected their health-related activities. Conclusions: Japanese moderately used the Internet via personal computers for health purposes, and rarely used the Internet via cell phones. Older people, people with lower education levels, and people with lower household incomes were less likely to access the Internet via cell phone. The Internet moderately improved users' health-related knowledge and attitudes but seldom changed their health-related abilities and activities. To encourage communication between health providers and consumers, it is important to improve eHealth literacy, especially in middle-aged people. It is also important to make adequate amendments to the reimbursement payment system and nationwide eHealth privacy and security framework, and to develop a collaborative relationship among industry, government, and academia.

We have designed, developed, and implemented an on-line interactive resource entitled "Evaluating Scientific Research literature" (ESRL) aimed at students from the first 2 years of the undergraduate program. In this article, we describe the resource, then use student data collected from questionnaire surveys to evaluate the resource within 2 years of its launch. Our results add to those reported previously and indicate that ESRL can enable students to start evaluating research articles when used during their undergraduate program. We conclude maximal learning is likely to occur when the resource can be embedded in the curriculum such that students have a clearly articulated context for the resource's activities, can see their relevance in relation to assessed assignments and can be encouraged to think deeply about the activities in conversation with one another and/or with staff.

J	Glenn, TC				Glenn, Travis C.			Field guide to next-generation DNA sequencers	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Review						2(nd) and 3(rd) generation sequencing; 454; Helicos; Illumina; Ion Torrent; Life Technologies; massively parallel sequencing; Pacific Biosystems; Roche; SOLiD		The diversity of available 2(nd) and 3(rd) generation DNA sequencing platforms is increasing rapidly. Costs for these systems range from <$100 000 to more than $1 000 000, with instrument run times ranging from minutes to weeks. Extensive trade-offs exist among these platforms. I summarize the major characteristics of each commercially available platform to enable direct comparisons. In terms of cost per megabase (Mb) of sequence, the Illumina and SOLiD platforms are clearly superior (<=$0.10/Mb vs. >$10/Mb for 454 and some Ion Torrent chips). In terms of cost per nonmultiplexed sample and instrument run time, the Pacific Biosciences and Ion Torrent platforms excel, with the 454 GS Junior and Illumina MiSeq also notable in this regard. All platforms allow multiplexing of samples, but details of library preparation, experimental design and data analysis can constrain the options. The wide range of characteristics among available platforms provides opportunities both to conduct groundbreaking studies and to waste money on scales that were previously infeasible. Thus, careful thought about the desired characteristics of these systems is warranted before purchasing or using any of them.

THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY			English	Article						Cognitive knowledge; Modeling; Creativity; Outreach learning; Science education	MOLECULAR-STRUCTURE; SELF-CONCEPT; SCIENCE; STUDENTS; EDUCATION; ACHIEVEMENT; SCHOOL; MOTIVATION; TEACHERS; INQUIRY	Modeling plays a key role in science research and education is considered to increase comprehensibility of abstract concepts and processes. Especially hands-on experiences in authentic learning environments offer students the opportunity to feel like real researchers and support the development of problem-based thinking skills. In our study, we applied an inquiry-based, out-of-school laboratory module that uses classic experimental challenges as well as innovative model-supported teaching to promote cognitive achievement. Our hands-on module was designed for 9th graders and combined experimentation and creative model work to visualize molecular and otherwise invisible contents of DNA-structure. After mental modeling, participants (N = 114; 40.87% female) produced a physical DNA-model using handcrafting materials. Our major aims were to evaluate the model qualities and to monitor potential relationships between successful model elaboration, individual creativity and knowledge levels. Therefore, we correlated students' creativity levels with model quality scores as well as with cognitive achievement. While no relations were found for creativity and model elaboration further results were gender-dependent. Girls produced significantly higher model quality scores and significant positive correlations were revealed between short-term and mid-term knowledge levels. Correlations also were observed between girls' cognitive achievement and the creativity subscale 'flow'. In contrast, neither creativity nor model quality were decisive for boys cognitive achievement. Their average simpler modeling results did not correlate with the short-term and mid-term knowledge levels, although they achieved similar scores on both. Model elaboration seemingly provides more support for girls and offers a suitable approach for emphasizing creativity in science education. In attempting to attract girls to scientific ideas, creative modeling may further support hands-on experimentation.

However, during its secondary fermentation, high amounts of ammonia are released to give a negative influence on the flavor of natto. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is a key enzyme for the ammonia produced and released, because it catalyzes the oxidative deamination of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate using NAD(+) or NADP(+) as co-factor during carbon and nitrogen metabolism processes. To solve this problem, we employed multiple computational methods model and re-design GDH from Bacillus subtilis natto. Firstly, a structure model of GDH with cofactor NADP(+) was constructed by threading and ab initio modeling. Then the substrate glutamate were flexibly docked into the structure model to form the substrate-binding mode. According to the structural analysis of the substrate-binding mode, Lys80, Lys116, Arg196, Thr200, and Ser351 in the active site were found could form a significant hydrogen bonding network with the substrate, which was thought to play a crucial role in the substrate recognition and position. Thus, these residues were then mutated into other amino acids, and the substrate binding affinities for each mutant were calculated. Finally, three single mutants (K80A, K116Q, and S351A) were found to have significant decrease in the substrate binding affinities, which was further supported by our biochemical experiments.

The small brown planthopper (Laodephax striatellus Fallen), one of the most destructive agricultural pests, causes great damage to crops including rice, wheat, and maize. However, information about the genome of L. striatellus is limited. In this study, a small RNA library was constructed from a mixed L. striatellus population and sequenced by Solexa sequencing technology. A total of 501 mature miRNAs were identified, including 227 conserved and 274 novel miRNAs belonging to 125 and 250 families, respectively. Sixty-nine conserved miRNAs that are included in 38 families are predicted to have an RNA secondary structure typically found in miRNAs. Many miRNAs were validated by stem-loop RT-PCR. Comparison with the miRNAs in 84 animal species from miRBase showed that the conserved miRNA families we identified are highly conserved in the Arthropoda phylum. Furthermore, miRanda predicted 2701 target genes for 378 miRNAs, which could be categorized into 52 functional groups annotated by gene ontology. The function of miRNA target genes was found to be very similar between conserved and novel miRNAs. This study of miRNAs in L. striatellus will provide new information and enhance the understanding of the role of miRNAs in the regulation of L. striatellus metabolism and development.

J	Bruhn, C; Syn, SY				Bruhn, Christopher; Syn, Sue Yeon			Pragmatic thought as a philosophical foundation for collaborative tagging and the Semantic Web	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						William James; Charles Sanders Peirce; Pragmatism; Folksonomy; Collaborative tagging; Semantic Web	ENCYCLOPEDIAS; WIKIPEDIA; SEMIOTICS; ACCURACY; METADATA; SYSTEMS; FRBR	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to use ideas drawn from two founders of American pragmatism, William James and Charles Sanders Peirce, in order to propose a philosophical foundation that supports the value of collaborative tagging and reinforces the structure and goals of the Semantic Web. Design/methodology/approach The study employs a close analysis of key literature by James and Peirce to answer recent calls for a philosophy of the Web and to respond to research in the LIS literature that has assessed the value and limitations of folksonomy. Moreover, pragmatic views are applied to illustrate the relationships among collaborative tagging, linked data, and the Semantic Web. Findings With a philosophical foundation in place, the study highlights the value of the minority tags that fall within the so-called long tail of the power law graph, and the importance of granting sufficient time for the full value of folksonomy to be revealed. The discussion goes further to explore how collaborative tagging could evolve into collaborative knowledge in the form of linked data.

Design of Experiments as a Means of Lean Value Delivery to the Flight Test Enterprise	SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						design of experiments (DOE)I flight test; ANOVA; lean; case study; F-16; statistics		Modern flight test tends to be a complex, expensive undertaking, so any increases in efficiency would result in considerable savings. Lean thinking is an effective method to identify value and eliminate waste and is particularly effective when applied to the entire flight test enterprise. Design of experiments is a statistical methodology that results in highly efficient flight test where only the samples needed are collected and analyzed. The application of design of experiments to flight test's value stream can result in a significant increase in lean value to the stakeholders and a reduction of waste. Design of experiments uses objective, verifiable statistical analysis to plan, execute, and analyze test. With lean stakeholder input, design of experiment's planning process ensures that the variables of interest are measured to provide a specified confidence in the analysis. Statistical confidence provides critical information on both the magnitude and significance of system performance. Further, design of experiments provides a statistical power that tells the stakeholders what magnitude of the effect could have been detected. Another benefit is that system response models are continually generated as test matrices are executed. These models enable the stakeholders to understand and evaluate system performance. This increases test safety and flexibility, which also creates value and eliminates waste in a resource-limited experiment. A conceptual model is developed which shows how the design of experiments aligns the flight test process along the lean value delivery stream and identifies the stakeholders at each step.(C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals Inc.

Querying and integrating spatial-temporal information on the Web of Data via time geography	JOURNAL OF WEB SEMANTICS			English	Article						Time geography; Web of Data; Ontology design patterns; Data integration; Linked open data; Federated querying	LOCAL INDICATORS; ONTOLOGY; SUPPORT; SCIENCE	The Web of Data is a rapidly growing collection of datasets from a wide range of domains, many of which have spatial-temporal aspects. Hagerstrand's time geography has proven useful for thinking about and understanding the movements and spatial-temporal constraints of humans. In this paper, we explore time geography as a means of querying and integrating multiple spatial-temporal data sources. We formalize the concept of the space-time prism as an ontology design pattern to use as a framework for understanding and representing constraints and interactions between entities in space and time. Webuild on a formalization of space-time prisms and apply it in the context of the Web of Data, making it usable across multiple domains and topics. We demonstrate the utility of this approach through two use cases from the domains of environmental monitoring and cultural heritage, showing how space-time prisms enable spatial-temporal and semantic reasoning directly on distributed data sources.

However, seed-hair which is generated in epidermal cell of seeds causes the difficulty of the seedling process, because of the seed germination and absorption inhibitions. For these reasons, carrot seeds are commercialized after mechanical hair removal process. However, in this process, various damage and seed loss occur and breeding of hairless-seed carrot cultivar is needed to overcome these various weaknesses and additional seed production costs. In this study, cDNA libraries using 2 combinations, which were composed of short-hair seed CT-ATR 615 OP 666-13 & long-hair seed CT-ATR 615 OP 671-9, and short-hair seed CT-SMR 616 OP 659-1 & long-hair seed CT-SMR 616 OP 677-14, were constructed and EST sequences of each individuals were analyzed to reveal carrot seed-hair characteristics. Firstly, analyzed EST sequences were classified into FunCat functional categories. As a result, significant differences have been identified in metabolism category, protein folding and stabilization, protein binding, C-compound binding category from both of two combinations. Secondly, several candidate EST sequences related to seed trichome differentiation and cellulose biosynthetic process were selected based on GO data of EST sequences. These differences based on FunCat categories and candidate EST obtained by GO data analysis are thought to be involved in the formation of carrot seed hair. Finally, 741 SSR sites and 33 SNP sites were identified from analyzed EST sequences of two combinations. Then we designed SNP and SSR primer sets to develop molecular markers. These molecular markers will be used for classification of carrot cultivars and study seed-hair characteristic.

On the other hand, although many studies show that mindtools facilitate learners' cognitive process, little research focus on their effects on learners' higher order cognitive thinking in blogs. This research developed a learning environment by using a mindtool-based blog to promote learners' higher order cognitive thinking in their online discussions and to assess their learning effects. The participants were 276 senior high school students from an information ethics class. A quasi-experimental research design was adopted in this research. The control group used the ordinary blogs. The Experimental Group 1 used the basic mindtools in blogs, which means that learners can use all the mindtool functions except the Knowledge Compilation function. The Experimental Group 2 used the advanced mindtools in blogs, which means that they can use all the mindtool functions, including the Knowledge Compilation function. The results indicated that both experimental groups showed better learning effects and more higher order cognitive thinking than the control group. Moreover, the higher order cognitive thinking category Analyze was found more often in the Experimental Group 2 than in the Experimental Group 1.

Previous literature suggests that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is related to creativity. However, none of previous studies have compared the effect of transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) over bilateral PPC on both verbal and visual divergent thinking (DT) and Remote Associates Test (RAT) in the same experimental design. Forty healthy participants were randomly assigned to tRNS (100-500 Hz) over bilateral PPC or sham group, for 15 min and current was set at 1.5 mA. Participants' creativity skills were assessed before and after brain stimulation with the Unusual Uses and the Picture Completion subtests from the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking and the RAT. ANCOVA (baseline scores as covariate) results indicated that tRNS group had significantly higher scores at post-test in RAT and visual originality compared to sham group. Unusual Uses, on the other hand, was not significant. Improvement in RAT suggests the involvement of PPC during via insight solution which may reflect internally directed attention that helps the recombination of remotely associated information. The improvement in visual originality dimension from DT may be due to a higher internally directed attention while reducing externally oriented attention.

We test whether the hippocampal declarative memory system contributes to multimodal audience design. The hippocampus, while traditionally linked to episodic and relational memory, has also been linked to the ability to imagine the mental states of others and use language flexibly. We examined the speech and gesture use of four patients with hippocampal amnesia when describing how to complete everyday tasks (e.g., how to tie a shoe) to an imagined child listener and an adult listener. Although patients with amnesia did not increase their total number of words and instructional steps for the child listener, they did produce representational gestures at significantly higher rates for the imagined child compared to the adult listener. They also gestured at similar frequencies to neurotypical peers, suggesting that hand gesture can be a meaningful communicative resource, even in the case of severe declarative memory impairment. We discuss the contributions of multiple memory systems to multimodal audience design and the potential of gesture to act as a window into the social cognitive processes of individuals with neurologic disorders.

J	Walton, N				Walton, Neil			Making Art Explicit: Knowledge, Reason and Art History in the Art and Design Curriculum	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION			English	Article						art; education; inferentialism; knowledge		Different and competing conceptions of knowledge have recently been the focus of debate in education, especially art education. The cognitive science conception of knowledge as information processing and storage in long-term memory is especially prominent in educational policy. By contrast, within writing that is directly about art education, discussion of knowledge has often been framed in negative, terms, as reductive, as entailing the imposition of rigid subject content and as antithetical to art. Taking issue with both these contrasting views, and using a non-empirical, philosophical approach, this article puts forward a case for the centrality of knowledge and reasoning within the art and design curriculum. Specifically, the article draws on inferentialism, a theory that has not previously been applied to art education. The argument presented understands art as discursive and rational, as concept using and reason sensitive, as essentially a disjunctive set of historical-social practices. Art education is then best thought of as a rational-critical introduction to knowing those practices, as making explicit their proprieties, entailments and contradictions and the choices that are thereby made possible. This view emphasises learning in art and design as developing increasing levels of responsibility and commitment by integrating concepts in practice and theory.

Functional traits determine heterospecific use of risk-related social information in forest birds of tropical South-East Asia	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						functional traits; mobbing; predation risk; social information; tropical rainforest	ALARM CALLS; ECOLOGY; PREY; VULNERABILITY; MECHANISMS; PREDATORS; ALLOMETRY	In birds and mammals, mobbing calls constitute an important form of social information that can attract numerous sympatric species to localized mobbing aggregations. While such a response is thought to reduce the future predation risk for responding species, there is surprisingly little empirical evidence to support this hypothesis. One way to test the link between predation risk reduction and mobbing attraction involves testing the relationship between species' attraction to mobbing calls and the functional traits that define their vulnerability to predation risk. Two important traits known to influence prey vulnerability include relative prey-to-predator body size ratio and the overlap in space use between predator and prey; in combination, these measures strongly influence prey accessibility, and therefore their vulnerability, to predators. Here, we combine community surveys with behavioral experiments of a diverse bird assemblage in the lowland rainforest of Sumatra to test whether the functional traits of body mass (representing body size) and foraging height (representing space use) can predict species' attraction to heterospecific mobbing calls. At four forest sites along a gradient of forest degradation, we characterized the resident bird communities using point count and mist-netting surveys, and determined the species groups attracted to standardized playbacks of mobbing calls produced by five resident bird species of roughly similar body size and foraging height. We found that (1) a large, diverse subcommunity of bird species was attracted to the mobbing calls and (2) responding species (especially the most vigorous respondents) tended to be (a) small (b) mid-storey foragers (c) with similar trait values as the species producing the mobbing calls. Our findings from the relatively lesser known bird assemblages of tropical Asia add to the growing evidence for the ubiquity of heterospecific information networks in animal communities, and provide empirical support for the long-standing hypothesis that predation risk reduction is a major benefit of mobbing information networks.

J	Solis, AD				Solis, Armando D.			Amino acid alphabet reduction preserves fold information contained in contact interactions in proteins	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						protein structure; amino acid sequence; contact potential; knowledge-based potential; sequence representation; threading	RANDOM-SEQUENCE PROTEINS; DE-NOVO PROTEINS; STRUCTURE PREDICTION; POTENTIALS; DESIGN; RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION; SUPERFAMILY; ALIGNMENT; ENERGIES	To reduce complexity, understand generalized rules of protein folding, and facilitate de novo protein design, the 20-letter amino acid alphabet is commonly reduced to a smaller alphabet by clustering amino acids based on some measure of similarity. In this work, we seek the optimal alphabet that preserves as much of the structural information found in long-range (contact) interactions among amino acids in natively-folded proteins. We employ the Information Maximization Device, based on information theory, to partition the amino acids into well-defined clusters. Numbering from 2 to 19 groups, these optimal clusters of amino acids, while generated automatically, embody well-known properties of amino acids such as hydrophobicity/polarity, charge, size, and aromaticity, and are demonstrated to maintain the discriminative power of long-range interactions with minimal loss of mutual information. Our measurements suggest that reduced alphabets (of less than 10) are able to capture virtually all of the information residing in native contacts and may be sufficient for fold recognition, as demonstrated by extensive threading tests. In an expansive survey of the literature, we observe that alphabets derived from various approaches-including those derived from physicochemical intuition, local structure considerations, and sequence alignments of remote homologs-fare consistently well in preserving contact interaction information, highlighting a convergence in the various factors thought to be relevant to the folding code. Moreover, we find that alphabets commonly used in experimental protein design are nearly optimal and are largely coherent with observations that have arisen in this work.

By conducting a quasi-experimental research, the ISAFS-assisted discussion board was assigned to the 32 learners of one class as the experimental group, whereas the general online discussion board was assigned to the 32 learners of the other class as the control group to support the online discussion learning activities of socio-scientific issues (SSIs). Analytical results show that the mean scores of overall, complexity, and perspective of socio-scientific reasoning performance have no statistically significant differences between the two groups. However, the in-depth interview results suggest that the learners in the experimental group gave positive feedback on the design concepts of the ISAFS and could explore the complexity and various perspectives of the issue through co-words and non-co-words presented on the ISAFS graph. Several suggestions regarding the functions and user interface of the ISAFS were also collected from the interviews to provide the directions for future studies.

Part I: Fundamental aspects	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN THERAPEUTIC DRUG CARRIER SYSTEMS			English	Review						artificial neural networks; computer software; drug product development; experimental design; factor screening; response surface methodology	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; EXTRUSION-SPHERONIZATION PROCESS; RESPONSE-SURFACE METHODOLOGY; FRACTIONAL FACTORIAL DESIGN; PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS; COMPUTER OPTIMIZATION; MATHEMATICAL OPTIMIZATION; STATISTICAL OPTIMIZATION; DICLOFENAC SODIUM; RELEASE	Design of an impeccable drug delivery product normally encompasses multiple objectives. For decades, this task has been attempted through trial and error, supplemented with the previous experience, knowledge, and wisdom of the formulator. Optimization of a pharmaceutical formulation or process using this traditional approach involves changing one variable at a time. Using this methodology, the solution of a specific problematic formulation characteristic can certainly be achieved, but attainment of the true optimal composition is never guaranteed. And for improvement in one characteristic, one has to trade off for degeneration in another. This customary approach of developing a drug product or process has been proved to be not only uneconomical in terms of time, money, and effort, but also unfavorable to fix errors, unpredictable, and at times even unsuccessfid. On the other hand, the modern formulation optimization approaches, employing systematic Design of Experiments (DoE), are extensively practiced in the development of diverse kinds of drug delivery devices to improve such irregularities. Such systematic approaches are far more advantageous, because they require fewer experiments to achieve an optimum formulation, make problem tracing and rectification quite easier, reveal drug/polymer interactions, simulate the product performance, and comprehend the process to assist in better formulation development and subsequent scale-up. Optimization techniques using DoE represent effective and cost-effective analytical tools to yield the "best solution 'to a particular "Problem."Through quantification of drug delivery systems, these approaches provide a depth of understanding as well as an ability to explore and defend ranges for formulation factors, where experimentation is completed before optimization is attempted. The key elements of a DoE optimization methodology encompass planning the study objectives, screening of influential variables, experimental designs, postulation of mathematical models for various chosen response characteristics, fitting experimental data into these model(s), mapping and generating graphic outcomes, and design validation using model-based response surface methodology. The broad topic of DoE optimization methodology is covered in two parts. Part 1 of the review attempts to provide thought-through and thorough information on diverse DoE aspects organized in a seven-step sequence. Besides dealing with basic DoE terminology for the novice, the article covers the niceties of several important experimental designs, mathematical models, and optimum search techniques using numeric and graphical methods, with special emphasis on computer-based approaches, artificial neural networks, and judicious selection of designs and models.

There are numerous fractal strange attractors in the brain that change as thinking processes vary. Further, the thinking processes change the human behaviors, especially in schizophrenia or internet addiction. The proposed chaos modelling and control theory may offer useful and relevant information on electrical stimulation therapy design to change this thinking processes through stimulating the brain's electrical activities. The experimental result of relaxing body from a lots of electrotherapy clinics helps mental disorders relax the thinking chaos in mind to replace their chaotic behaviors from the brain's electrical activities. This paper tries to explain the above claim in the aspect of the electrotherapy and control theory to suggest the control signal of electrotherapy based on an assumption for chaos model of patient and its control signals design according to multiple stabilization solutions. In the future, the electrical stimulation therapy will be proof in the Raphael Humanistic Clinic or the other electrotherapy clinics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Transferring patient's biomedical information using illumination and communication technology under dim lighting in hospitals	OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS			English	Article						ICT; vDSM; RPO-OFDM; Li-Fi; Hospital	OFDM	Over the last 60 years, there have been incorrigible thought towards the development and design of hospital facilities in lighting. In specialty hospitals, new standards in lighting for patient rooms and design of healthy environments have been the subject of architectural thinking. Dimmed light emitting diode (LED) luminaries will provide visual comfort with appropriate optics during patient's monitoring. Not only the ambience in the patient room but also the task of transferring patient's health care information can be accomplished via illumination and communication technology which includes LED lighting together with light fidelity technology. In this paper we propose a hybrid digital dimming modulation which combines variable delta sigma modulation dimming modulation technique with reverse polarity optical OFDM data modulation technique to dim the LEDs installed in the patient's room and to transfer the patient's health care details.

J	Rohrbach, T				Rohrbach, Tobias			Loud and Negative: Exploring Negativity in Voter Thoughts About Women and Men Politicians	POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						candidate evaluation; gender; negativity; think aloud; thought listing	AMBIVALENT SEXISM; GENDER; STEREOTYPES; CANDIDATES; IMPACT; MEDIA	Negative information about political candidates is readily available in contemporary political communication. Moreover, negativity is tightly connected to gendered expectations about what constitutes appropriate behavior for politicians. Yet, existing theoretical models of negativity and candidate evaluation typically do not address the role of gender and the available empirical evidence remains inconclusive regarding the electoral consequences of the interaction of negativity and gender. This article tackles these gaps in two studies to investigate how negativity manifests in voters' thoughts about women and men politicians in response to negative media cues and how these thoughts affect vote preference. Study 1 uses a mixed methods think-aloud approach to trace the first impression formation and subsequent decision-making pro-cess (N = 78). Study 2 replicates the design as an online thought listing survey experiment (N =142). A similar quantitative pattern emerges across both studies: (a) Negative cues elicit similar amounts of negativity in voters' thoughts for women and men politicians, (b) these negative thoughts strongly lower candidates' electoral chances, (c) but less so for women candidates. The qualitative analysis suggests that negative cues heuristically affect earlier stages of impression formation while voters are likely to rely on gender cues when they rationalize their vote decision.

Longitudinal Study of the Impacts of a Climate Change Curriculum on Undergraduate Student Learning: Initial Results	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate change; learning community; interdisciplinary; systems-based design; environmental ethics; environmental science; community based learning; longitudinal research; case studies	SUSTAINABILITY; COMPETENCES; SCIENCE; MODEL	The present study assesses the efficacy of a semester-long undergraduate sustainability curriculum designed from a systems approach. The three-course curriculum, which incorporated environmental science and ethics courses along with an integrative course using a community-based learning pedagogy, was intended to provide students with experience using knowledge and skills from distinct disciplines in a holistic way in order to address the complex problems of the human acceptance of and response to anthropogenic climate change. In the fall of 2013, 23 of the 24 sophomore general education students enrolled in the three courses were surveyed at the beginning and end of the semester; 17 of those same students completed the survey again in the spring of 2016, their senior year. Results, which focus on the 17 students who continued to participate through their senior year, were analyzed with quantitative and qualitative methodologies. The pre/post data from the surveys demonstrated significant improvement in climate literacy, certainty, concern and urgency over the course of the semester; the senior data indicated that those improvements were largely retained. The study also suggests that the nine-credit curriculum improved transferable skills such as interdisciplinary thinking, self-confidence and public speaking. A qualitative analysis of three student cases, informed by a focus group (n = 7) of seniors along with other sources of information, suggested retention of such transferable skills, and, in some cases, deeper involvement in climate and sustainability action.

Communication researchers have identified shortcomings of the deficit model approach, which assumes that skepticism toward science is based on a lack of information or scientific literacy, and encourage scientists to facilitate open-minded exchange with the public. We describe an ambassador approach, to develop a scientist's impact identity, which integrates his or her research, personal interests and experiences to achieve societal impacts. The scientist identifies a community or focal group to engage, on the basis of his or her impact identity, learns about that group, and promotes inclusion of all group members by engaging in venues in which that group naturally gathers, rather than in traditional education settings. Focal group members stated that scientists communicated effectively and were responsive to participant questions and ideas. Scientists reported professional and personal benefits from this approach.

J	Trouche, E; Johansson, P; Hall, L; Mercier, H				Trouche, Emmanuel; Johansson, Petter; Hall, Lars; Mercier, Hugo			Vigilant conservatism in evaluating communicated information	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DECISION-MAKING; ADVICE; CONFIDENCE; TASK; STRATEGIES; JUDGMENT; ABILITY; TRUST; SELF	In the absence of other information, people put more weight on their own opinion than on the opinion of others: they are conservative. Several proximal mechanisms have been suggested to account for this finding. One of these mechanisms is that people cannot access reasons for other people's opinions, but they can access the reasons for their own opinions-whether they are the actual reasons that led them to hold the opinions (rational access to reasons), or post-hoc constructions (biased access to reasons). In four experiments, participants were asked to provide an opinion, and then faced with another participant's opinion and asked if they wanted to revise their initial opinion. Some questions were manipulated so that the advice participants were receiving was in fact their own opinion, while what they thought was their own opinion was in fact not. In all experiments, the participants were consistently biased towards what they thought was their own opinion, showing that conservativeness cannot be explained by rational access to reasons, which should have favored the advice. One experiment revealed that conservativeness was not decreased under time pressure, suggesting that biased access to reasons is an unlikely explanation for conservativeness. The experiments also suggest that repetition plays a role in advice taking, with repeated opinions being granted more weight than non-fluent opinions. Our results are not consistent with any of the established proximal explanations for conservatism. Instead, we suggest an ultimate explanation-vigilant conservatism-that sees conservatism as adaptive since receivers should be wary of senders' interests, as they rarely perfectly converge with theirs.

An Implementation Science Framework to Develop a Clinical Decision Support Tool for Familial Hypercholesterolemia	JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE			English	Article						electronic health record; clinical decision support; CDS; familial hypercholesterolemia; FH; genomics	USABILITY EVALUATION; HYBRID DESIGNS; THINK-ALOUD; INFORMATION; GUIDELINE	Electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical decision support (CDS) can address the low awareness and undertreatment of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a disorder associated with a markedly increased risk of coronary heart disease. We aimed to incorporate provider perspectives into the development and implementation of a CDS tool for FH. An implementation science framework and a user-centered design process were used to create a CDS tool for FH. Primary care physicians and specialist physicians participated in qualitative interviews, usability testing and an implementation survey. The CDS was configured in two formats-a best practice alert (BPA) and an in-basket message and subsequently deployed in the EHR in silent mode. The key themes that emerged from the analysis of interview transcripts included understanding and awareness of FH, clinical workflow, physician preferences and value of CDS tools, perspectives on patient needs and values and dissemination and implementation. Recommendations related to usability included preferred CDS format and placement, content, timing and frequency, and level of alert urgency/prioritization. In response to the survey, 84.6% of physicians agreed that the CDS would improve early FH diagnosis and 92.3% agreed that it would help them identify and manage FH patients. Physician feedback led to iterative CDS refinement. In summary, we developed a CDS tool for FH using an implementation science framework and physician feedback. Initial deployment revealed a significant burden of FH and the potential for the CDS tool to have a large impact.

Transposed to a medical knowledge, this new model, originally conceived by the authors and called the 'allosteric learning model', offers new ways of considering patient education. After criticizing the 'grand theories' of learning, mainly the latest ones called constructivist models, the authors suggest a new set of micromodels designed to explain thoroughly the functioning of the patient's thought process (questions, frame of references, semantic network,...) and his understanding of medical information on his own disease. For health care providers, these models also offer a series of new pedagogical approaches both efficient and original to regulate the act of education based on confrontation, mobilisation, integration, etc. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Designing digital information environments to support serendipity can not only provide users with new knowledge, but also propel them in directions they might not otherwise have traveled insurprising and delighting them along the way. As serendipity involves unexpected circumstances it cannot be directly controlled, but it can be potentially influenced. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work has focused on providing a rich empirical understanding of how it might be influenced. We interviewed 14 creative professionals to identify their self-reported strategies aimed at increasing the likelihood of serendipity. These strategies form a framework for examining ways existing digital environments support serendipity and for considering how future environments can create opportunities for it. This is a new way of thinking about how to design for serendipity; by supporting the strategies found to increase its likelihood rather than attempting to support serendipity as a discrete phenomenon, digital environments not only have the potential to help users experience serendipity but also encourage them to adopt the strategies necessary to experience it more often.

J	Shreiner, TL; Guzdial, M				Shreiner, Tamara L.; Guzdial, Mark			The information won't just sink in: Helping teachers provide technology-assisted data literacy instruction in social studies	BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						literacy; participatory design; secondary education; technology acceptance model; visualization	DOMAIN-SPECIFIC LANGUAGES; DATA VISUALIZATIONS; CONTENT KNOWLEDGE; DESIGN RESEARCH; COMPREHENSION; EDUCATION; EFFICACY; CONSTRUCTION; STUDENTS; BELIEFS	In this study, support for teaching data literacy in social studies is provided through the design of a pedagogical support system informed by participatory design sessions with both pre-service and in-service social studies teachers. It provides instruction on teaching and learning data literacy in social studies, examples of standards-based lesson plans, made-to-purpose data visualization tools and minimal manuals that put existing online tools in a social studies context. Based on case studies of eleven practicing teachers, this study provides insight into features of technology resources that social studies teachers find usable and useful for using data visualizations as part of standards- and inquiry-based social studies instruction, teaching critical analysis of data visualizations and helping students create data visualizations with online computing tools. The final result, though, is that few of our participating teachers have yet adopted the provided resources into their own classrooms, which highlights weaknesses of the technology acceptance model for describing teacher adoption. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Data literacy is an important part of social studies education in the United States. Most teachers do not teach data literacy as a part of social studies. Teachers may adopt technology to help them teach data literacy if they think it is useful and usable. What this paper adds Educational technology can help teachers learn about data literacy in social studies. Social studies teachers want simple tools that fit with their existing curricula, give them new project ideas and help students learn difficult concepts. Making tools useful and usable does not predict adoption; context plays a large role in a social studies teachers' adoption. Implications for practice and/or policy Designing purpose-built tools for social studies teachers will encourage them to teach data literacy in their classes. Professional learning opportunities for teachers around data literacy should include opportunities for experimentation with tools. Teachers are not likely to use tools if they are not accompanied by lesson and project ideas.

J	JEFFREY, HJ				JEFFREY, HJ			PRAGMATIC DESIGN OF MEETINGS AND PRESENTATIONS	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article								Designing and running good meetings and presentations is a mystery to many software engineers, including many very experienced ones. Many workshops, training courses, and books address the mechanics (overheads, speaking style, and so on), but these provide comparatively little information beyond the most basic reminders, such as "no personal insults" or "make an agenda and stick to it." These basics do not address such difficult problems as presenting to an audience made up of people from several departments at several levels of management, handling skeptical or oppositional people, what to say to the manager whose authority is being undermined, talking to top management in language they can understand about things they care about (rather than what the programmer thinks they ought to care about), and so on. This article presents an organized and comprehensive approach to designing meetings and presentations. It discusses techniques for addressing the differing attitudes, degrees of knowledge, and concerns of the audience, and presents a step-by-step procedure for designing a presentation that considers the audience's knowledge, attitudes, and perspectives.

GPTE benefits from its non-linear traffic correlation modeling and the graph-parallel processing framework built on clustered machines. By representing the road network as a property graph, GPTE decomposes the numerous computations involved in non-linear models to vertices and performs traffic estimation via neural network modeling and iterative information propagation. This paper presents our experiences in designing and implementing GPTE on top of the Spark, an emerging cluster computing framework. Extensive experiments are performed with real-world data input from Singapore's transport authority. Experimental results show that GPTE achieves as high as 88 percent accuracy in traffic estimation and up to 8x performance gain in computation efficiency with the optimization techniques applied. Comparison study demonstrates that GPTE outperforms the baseline solutions by 34 percent on accuracy and 46 percent on processing time.

This problem affects society at large and has severely impacted the mindset of leadership, precluding in-depth debates involving citizens that lack an understanding of the basic notions and concepts that drive other agencies. Thus, the Lisbon Declaration, approved at the European Humanities Conference based on proposals by UNESCO, CIPSH, and FCT, calls for the integrated teaching of humanities and sciences units at all levels of education, including the doctoral level. This chapter discusses the potential contribution of geoarchaeology towards that aim, as this discipline sits at the heart of the humanities-sciences interaction, thus bridging science methods with human behavior. Geoarchaeology is one of the most important archaeological research methods that offers unprecedented levels of integration between disciplines and geoarchaeological research. It is a good example of how geosciences can contribute towards re-thinking education, in terms of research-based education: learning to research, learning that research on the earth and humans is by nature interdisciplinary, learning to design answerable questions, learning to frame scientific analysis within wider meanings and prospects, and fostering an understanding of the truth and the criteria for truth. This topic is a unique bridge between both human and earth sciences and between science and human behavior, which play pivotal roles in communicating and educating about sustainability. The multidisciplinary dimensions of geoarchaeological approaches have encouraged continuous development and innovation of methods and approaches that have provided new possibilities for explorations in geosciences, research on earth and humans, learning to design answerable questions, and fostering an understanding of truth and the criteria for truth. This text discusses two examples: pigment analysis and micromorphology. Pigment analysis relates scientific methods with rock and mobile art, and also involves experimentation in the making of the art itself, which is a powerful didactic tool, thus linking science with daily observed realities and related cultural traits. Micromorphology is a geoarchaeological methodology currently applied to research, which provides a unique insight into the interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinary relationships associated with humans and society. Despite the complexity of this approach, it provides easily understood information on various segments of society; e.g., soil formation, thus making it one of the most effective tools in the Earth Sciences sector contributing to sustainability and related to daily behavior practices.

J	Aleksander, I				Aleksander, I			Advances in intelligent information technology: re-branding or progress towards conscious machines?	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						artificial intelligence; history of technology; conscious machines; computational intelligence		Is artificial intelligence (AI) just something that is done in laboratories disconnected from the development of the pragmatic computing, which constitutes current information technology or does it contribute to progress in computing and information technology? It has even been suggested that advances in AI are merely a re-branding exercise for promises that are rarely kept. This paper is a personal view of the forces that have driven the development of AI in the past and what might be a serious paradigm shift in the future. The latter points to what appears to be the most abstruse corner of the subject: the modelling of the human brain and the possibility of designing systems with the brain's ability to create conscious thought. There have been accusations that AI is always ahead on promise and behind on delivery. This is an inaccurate view. In broad terms, the argument presented here suggests that as AI developed, progress was achieved by overcoming unforeseen difficulties in the pursuit of very ambitious targets, not just a re-branding of promises. This process not only advanced AI but also fed into the mainstream of computing that underpins the information technology of the present time. While the outcome of the paradigm shift towards conscious machines, which is examined at the end of this paper is still unclear, it is possible to speculate how information technology might be affected in the future.

A well-defined assessment approach provides detailed insights into program weaknesses and leads to continuous improvement. Whereas a poor assessment approach does not reflect the underlying weaknesses and may result in a useless effort. Furthermore, each accreditation body may have a different recommended outcome measurement approach. As a result, academic institutions may make adhoc choices just to satisfy accreditation requirements rather than designing a sustainable measurement approach. On the other hand, the magnitude of huge tasks for satisfying multiple accreditation bodies results in fatigue and mental stress for academic staff. ABET is a well-known international program accreditation body, and NCAAA is a local accreditation body for academic programs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In this paper, we have documented that how a sustainable outcome measurement mechanism can be designed to satisfy both ABET and NCAAA requirements. The core contribution of this paper is relevant specifically for academic programs in the Kingdom striving to meet both ABET and NCAAA requirements and is also relevant for all education programs to design an appropriate program assessment approach to ensure a sustainable process to foster better learning among students.

However, the perceptions of multiple forms of feedback among learners and their contributions to reflective learning is yet to attract significant attention, particularly in the Information Systems (IS) context. This research investigates the antecedent constituents of feedback and how they contribute to an overall perception of feedback in an introductory IS course. A research model grounded in the pedagogical literature was operationalised and quantitative data collected and analysed using Partial Least Squares. The results indicate that summative and generic assessment feedback were found to be significant towards formulating an overall perception of feedback, and that such perception is significant in influencing a learner's experience. This further highlights the fact that students are overwhelmingly assessment focused and may not engage in reflective practice pertaining to their overall learning experience - necessitating the establishment of learner's reflective lenses to guide them towards such reflection.

Therefore, five pre-service teachers enrolled in a university undergraduate course called 'Inquiry-based chemistry education II' (5 ECTS) were involved in an empirical case study. The pre-service teachers' implementations of inquiry were studied from their reports on self-designed context-based inquiry teaching sequences for students age 13-15, and their beliefs by interviewing them after the course. The results indicate that the most frequent aspects of inquiry, which were implemented, were that inquiry (i) includes a context, (ii) is a way to act, (iii) is a way to think, and (iv) includes source/information evaluation and argumentation. The pre-service teachers' beliefs about inquiry were shown to reflect manifold aspects of inquiry, such as the difficulty in explaining it. However, this difficulty in encapsulating inquiry into a clear-cut definition is not necessarily an impediment to inquiry-based teaching. Furthermore, inquiry is inherently context-bound, and context-based teaching requires extra-situational knowledge from the context and not only declarative knowledge from science. This should be considered to support effective professional development.

First, these clinical indicators are rarely reviewed outside of existing quality and safety reporting. Second, many medical specialists view their CPD requirements as time-consuming, having minimal impact on practice change and improving patient outcomes. There is an opportunity to build new user interfaces based on these data, designed to support individual and group reflection. Data-informed reflective practice has the potential to generate new insights about performance, bridging the gap between CPD and clinical practice. Objective: This study aims to understand why routinely collected administrative data have not yet become widely used to support reflective practice and lifelong learning. Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews (N=19) with thought leaders from a range of backgrounds, including clinicians, surgeons, chief medical officers, information and communications technology professionals, informaticians, researchers, and leaders from related industries. Interviews were thematically analyzed by 2 independent coders. Results: Respondents identified visibility of outcomes, peer comparison, group reflective discussions, and practice change as potential benefits. The key barriers included legacy technology, distrust with data quality, privacy, data misinterpretation, and team culture. Respondents suggested recruiting local champions for co-design, presenting data for understanding rather than information, coaching by specialty group leaders, and timely reflection linked to CPD as enablers to successful implementation. Conclusions: Overall, there was consensus among thought leaders, bringing together insights from diverse backgrounds and medical jurisdictions. We found that clinicians are interested in repurposing administrative data for professional development despite concerns with underlying data quality, privacy, legacy technology, and visual presentation. They prefer group reflection led by supportive specialty group leaders, rather than individual reflection. Our findings provide novel insights into the specific benefits, barriers, and benefits of potential reflective practice interfaces based on these data sets. They can inform the design of new models of in-hospital reflection linked to the annual CPD planning-recording-reflection cycle.

This phenomenon has increased the digital gap, disparities, and inequalities in global and local contexts. This paper reports a systematic literature mapping of 180 articles published from 2000 to 2021 discussing the digital gap. The documents were retrieved using boolean operations in two databases, adding terms related to gender, age, ethnicity, and disabilities, focusing on population groups that are especially vulnerable to the effects of this phenomenon. The method included categorizing the retrieved documents to provide a general view of the most concerning topics in the academic and research community. This analysis concludes (a) the approaches to address this topic are diverse, as this is a multilayered, complex, and interconnected issue; (b) many studies refer to developed countries; however, fewer are those who observe or analyze the underdeveloped regions; (c) the majority of published papers in the last decade report information and communication technologies (ICT) and their role in bridging the gap, showing an opportunity area for designing these technologies considering more accessible approaches through flexible technology approaches; (d) this study's results are a valuable source of information to identify the design requirements for accessible products and service systems. The last section provides a detailed explanation of the findings.

Often, both local and scientific knowledge encompass important pieces of information for such a projection. Acknowledging the diversity across the two types of knowledge, we investigated their differences and similarities in a twofold case study, conducting a participatory mapping (PM) exercise with local wine growers, as well as a Multi Criteria Evaluation (MCE) with non-local experts from science, government and industry. Hence, we not only utilised two different knowledge elicitation methods, but also two types of 'Knowledges'. Within a region dominated by vineyards, and with expected land use change, we compared the two results quantitatively, in a participatory evaluation workshop, and with annotations gained through the participatory mapping exercise. Both methods have their merits, with the results from the participatory mapping perceived as being more plausible, and the MCE scoring higher in terms of spatial resolution. Whilst the participatory mapping yields more and better contextualised information, the results from the MCE can be better compared across study areas.

Interhemispheric Transfer of Semantic Information Facilitates Bilateral Word Recognition	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL			English	Article						semantic processing; interhemispheric interactions; word recognition; divided visual field	VISUAL-FIELD ADVANTAGE; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; SPATIAL ATTENTION; CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; REACTION-TIME; LANGUAGE; COMMUNICATION; POSITION; CATEGORIZATION	Language comprehension is left-lateralized but with variable contributions from the right hemisphere. When both hemispheres are stimulated simultaneously using divided visual field presentation, performance may be enhanced or hindered depending on the complexity of the task, and these effects may relate to independent processing in both hemispheres or to information transfer between hemispheres. Simultaneous stimulation of both hemispheres is thought to suppress interhemispheric interactions, but information transfer may nonetheless occur. Studies with simultaneous bilateral displays have demonstrated that semantic information from the contralateral visual field (and hemisphere) can facilitate relatedness judgments and lexical decisions. The current study extends this line of research by assessing semantic information transfer in a bilateral word identification task. Task manipulations involving directed spatial attention and asymmetric primes (e.g., ATOM -> BOMB) were used to isolate automatic priming as opposed to top-down processing. The results revealed 2 main findings: (a) interhemispheric priming in the form of improved word recognition occurred specifically in conditions designed to isolate automatic transfer of semantic information, that is, in the attended visual field for the target word in asymmetric prime pairs, and (b) there is evidence for an asymmetrical transfer of semantic information, in that the subordinate left visual field-right hemisphere benefited more from such transfer. Together, these results demonstrate evidence for automatic interhemispheric transfer of semantic information, even under conditions of simultaneous bilateral display.

Defining the optimum strategy for identifying adults and children with coeliac disease: systematic review and economic modelling	HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT			English	Review							IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME; ANTITISSUE TRANSGLUTAMINASE ANTIBODIES; DEAMIDATED-GLIADIN-PEPTIDES; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; IRON-DEFICIENCY ANEMIA; GLUTEN-SENSITIVE ENTEROPATHY; TYPE-1 DIABETES-MELLITUS; ORGAN-SPECIFIC AUTOANTIBODIES; COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; ANTI-ENDOMYSIAL ANTIBODY	Background: Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by ingesting gluten. It affects approximately 1% of the UK population, but only one in three people is thought to have a diagnosis. Untreated coeliac disease may lead to malnutrition, anaemia, osteoporosis and lymphoma.Objectives: The objectives were to define at-risk groups and determine the cost-effectiveness of active case-finding strategies in primary care.Design: (1) Systematic review of the accuracy of potential diagnostic indicators for coeliac disease. (2) Routine data analysis to develop prediction models for identification of people who may benefit from testing for coeliac disease. (3) Systematic review of the accuracy of diagnostic tests for coeliac disease. (4) Systematic review of the accuracy of genetic tests for coeliac disease (literature search conducted in April 2021). (5) Online survey to identify diagnostic thresholds for testing, starting treatment and referral for biopsy. (6) Economic modelling to identify the cost-effectiveness of different active case-finding strategies, informed by the findings from previous objectives.Data sources: For the first systematic review, the following databases were searched from 1997 to April 2021: MEDLINE (R) (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA), Embase (R) (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Cochrane Library, Web of ScienceTM (ClarivateTM, Philadelphia, PA, USA), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials database. For the second systematic review, the following databases were searched from January 1990 to August 2020: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Kleijnen Systematic Reviews (KSR) Evidence, WHO ICTRP and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials database. For prediction model development, Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum and a subcohort of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were used; for estimates for the economic models, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum was used.Review methods: For review 1, cohort and case-control studies reporting on a diagnostic indicator in a population with and a population without coeliac disease were eligible. For review 2, diagnostic cohort studies including patients presenting with coeliac disease symptoms who were tested with serological tests for coeliac disease and underwent a duodenal biopsy as reference standard were eligible. In both reviews, risk of bias was assessed using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool. Bivariate random-effects meta-analyses were fitted, in which binomial likelihoods for the numbers of true positives and true negatives were assumed.Results: People with dermatitis herpetiformis, a family history of coeliac disease, migraine, anaemia, type 1 diabetes, osteoporosis or chronic liver disease are 1.5-2 times more likely than the general population to have coeliac disease; individual gastrointestinal symptoms were not useful for identifying coeliac disease. For children, women and men, prediction models included 24, 24 and 21 indicators of coeliac disease, respectively. The models showed good discrimination between patients with and patients without coeliac disease, but performed less well when externally validated. Serological tests were found to have good diagnostic accuracy for coeliac disease. Immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase had the highest sensitivity and endomysial antibody the highest specificity. There was little improvement when tests were used in combination. Survey respondents (n = 472) wanted to be 66% certain of the diagnosis from a blood test before starting a gluten-free diet if symptomatic, and 90% certain if asymptomatic. Cost-effectiveness analyses found that, among adults, and using serological testing alone, immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase was most cost-effective at a 1% pre-test probability (equivalent to population screening). Strategies using immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody plus human leucocyte antigen or human leucocyte antigen plus immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase with any pre-test probability had similar cost-effectiveness results, which were also similar to the cost-effectiveness results of immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase at a 1% pre-test probability. The most practical alternative for implementation within the NHS is likely to be a combination of human leucocyte antigen and immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase testing among those with a pre-test probability above 1.5%. Among children, the most cost-effective strategy was a 10% pre-test probability with human leucocyte antigen plus immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase, but there was uncertainty around the most cost-effective pre-test probability. There was substantial uncertainty in economic model results, which means that there would be great value in conducting further research.Limitations: The interpretation of meta-analyses was limited by the substantial heterogeneity between the included studies, and most included studies were judged to be at high risk of bias. The main limitations of the prediction models were that we were restricted to diagnostic indicators that were recorded by general practitioners and that, because coeliac disease is underdiagnosed, it is also under-reported in health-care data. The cost-effectiveness model is a simplification of coeliac disease and modelled an average cohort rather than individuals. Evidence was weak on the probability of routine coeliac disease diagnosis, the accuracy of serological and genetic tests and the utility of a gluten-free diet.Conclusions: Population screening with immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase (1% pre-test probability) and of immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody followed by human leucocyte antigen testing or human leucocyte antigen testing followed by immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase with any pre-test probability appear to have similar cost-effectiveness results. As decisions to implement population screening cannot be made based on our economic analysis alone, and given the practical challenges of identifying patients with higher pre-test probabilities, we recommend that human leucocyte antigen combined with immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase testing should be considered for adults with at least a 1.5% pre-test probability of coeliac disease, equivalent to having at least one predictor. A more targeted strategy of 10% pre-test probability is recommended for children (e.g. children with anaemia).Future work: Future work should consider whether or not population-based screening for coeliac disease could meet the UK National Screening Committee criteria and whether or not it necessitates a long-term randomised controlled trial of screening strategies. Large prospective cohort studies in which all participants receive accurate tests for coeliac disease are needed.Study registration: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42019115506 and CRD42020170766.

A collaborative working model for enhancing the learning process of science & engineering students	COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Higher education; ICT learning technologies; Quality assessments; Computers in human behavior; Collaborative learning; Student experiences; Collective intelligence	COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE; PEER ASSESSMENT; FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT; HIGHER-EDUCATION; SELF; WEB; ENVIRONMENTS; IMPACT	Science and engineering education are mostly based on content assimilation and development of skills. However, to adequately prepare students for today's world, it is also necessary to stimulate critical thinking and make them reflect on how to improve current practices using new tools and technologies. In this line, the main motivation of this research consists in exploring ways supported by technology to enhance the learning process of students and to better prepare them to face the challenges of today's world. To this end, the purpose of this work is to design an innovative learning project based on collaborative work among students, and research its impact in achieving better learning outcomes, generating of collective intelligence and further motivation. The proposed collaborative working model is based on peer review assessment methodology implemented through a learning web-platform. Thus, students were encouraged to peer review their classmates' works. They had to make comments, suggest improvements, and assess final assignments. Teaching staff managed and supervised the whole process. Students were selected from computer science engineering at the University of Alicante (Spain). Results suggested greater content assimilation and enhanced learning in several scientific skills. The students' final grade exceeded what any student could produce individually, but we cannot conclude that real collective intelligence was generated. Learning methodologies based on the possibilities of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) provide new ways to transmit and manage knowledge in higher education. Collaborating in peer assessment enhances the students' motivation and promotes the active learning. In addition, this method can be very helpful and time saving for instructors in the management of large groups.

In particular, the rising usage of mobile devices, including smartphones and tabs, has invited researchers to design and develop learning applications and games for such platforms. Mobile applications and games have been developed for learning languages like many other domains. However, most of these games are fun-based and lack a holistic design and development approach. Therefore, as a principal contribution, this research presents a theoretical model for designing language learning games in a cultural context. The proposed model combines the elements of sociocultural theory with the concepts and elements of gamification, keeping in view the requirements and educational settings, including level and mode of education, etc., to ensure the effectiveness and usability of the developed game. Subsequently, based on the proposed model, a Language Learning Game (LLG) has been designed and developed through a systematic process that involves game design, low-fidelity, and high-fidelity prototyping and its validation. The LLG has been evaluated comprehensively at different stages by incorporating standard methods. Whereby this research augments the existing set of heuristics by proposing a number of specialized heuristics for the evaluation of serious games to gauge their conformance to the cultural context. The evaluation results show that the game has overall usability scores of 90%. While the quasi-experiment-based pre-test and post-test have been conducted, the results reveal that the results obtained by LLG are statistically significantly better than adopted mobile application and traditional group.

As a core part of virtual modeling, 3D virtual modeling is crucial to improve the intuitiveness of state monitoring, enhance human-cyber interactions, visualize conditions and simulations, and provide visual guides in digital twin. However, although 3D virtual modeling in digital twin has many benefits for different applications, its complex characteristics become obstacles for novice engineers to develop and utilize. Besides, research information about 3D virtual modeling in digital twin is too scattered, while there has been no literature review that specially and comprehensively summarizes and analyzes it. To help novice engineers understand and scheme 3D virtual modeling in digital twin for future research and applications, this paper reviews 106 digital twin 3D modeling cases with their characteristics, including deployment targets, purposes & roles, collaborative models, data flows, the autonomy of 3D modeling, fidelity, twinning rates, enabling technologies, and enabling tools. This paper then discusses and analyzes the review outcomes via statistics. Finally, this paper also proposes a thinking map for scheming the 3D virtual modeling in digital twin. In general, 3D virtual modeling is oriented by the motivation behind different digital twins, engineers hence should reflect on the purposes, scenarios, resources, and long-term visions of their projects. When designing characteristics of 3D virtual modeling, engineers must consider functions, capabilities of data processing and transmission, timeliness of data, applicability, and specialty of each characteristic. For future work, this paper highlights three important research issues to realize the prospect of 3D virtual modeling, including the versatility of autonomous 3D modeling, incremental updates of 3D models, and optimal planning of data collections for 3D modeling. Besides, future work will also investigate the enhancement of 3D virtual modeling via relevant information technologies, such as IoT-based data collections, machine vision-based data processing, and adaptive machine learning-based dynamic modeling.

Descriptive, Qualitative Study of Women Who Use Mobile Health Applications to Obtain Perinatal Health Information	JOGNN-JOURNAL OF OBSTETRIC GYNECOLOGIC AND NEONATAL NURSING			English	Article						mobile health applications; patient education; perinatal	COGNITIVE LOAD THEORY; EDUCATION; SCIENCE	Objective: To determine the extent to which perinatal mobile health applications (mHealth apps) are usable and desirable for women who seek information about childbearing. Design: A descriptive, qualitative research design. Setting: Through snowball sampling, participants were recruited from the social media sites Craigslist, Nextdoor, and Facebook and were asked to provide friends with a study invitation letter. Participants: Sixteen women who were pregnant or in the postpartum period and had used mHealth apps participated in the study. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted to determine how participants perceived and used mobile applications for information about pregnancy. Participants were then given a perinatal app and asked to find specific information with the use of a think-aloud process. Data were organized, coded, and then grouped into concept maps in an iterative process until themes emerged. Results: The themes that emerged were as follows: mHealth Apps Are a Source of Support During Childbearing, mHealth Apps Are Functional Tools, and There Are Limitations of mHealth Apps. Participants felt supported when they used mHealth apps because the information was personalized and they could use the apps to connect with family and the online community. mHealth apps have perceived limitations because women sometimes feel disconnected from the information they receive, some providers and families do not support their use, and security issues may be a concern. Conclusion: mHealth apps can be useful educational tools. Providers can support women by recommending select apps for use. Because of minimal oversight from app distribution platforms or health care organizations in the development and use of educational mHealth apps, a system to certify or verify mHealth apps should be developed.

Here, we report ultrastrong alloys, discovered via high-throughput screening of the nc CoCr33-69 materials library. The nc materials library was fabricated using magnetron co-sputtering. The alloys consist of textured, columnar structures with grain size in the nanometric regime. We found that the texture and phase composition can be tailored by changing the Cr concentration. In the investigated region of the nc CoCr system, a relatively broad spectrum of yield strength, determined via micropillar compression tests, was found ranging from 1.41 GPa up to 3.64 GPa. The remarkable strength increment was caused by a chemically-and thermally driven phase and microstructure evolution of the system. The strongest alloys were found in the regions containing the 8CoCr phase, which was considered previously as metastable. Density functional calculations revealed that the 8CoCr phase is more energetically favourable in Cr-rich regions compared to single-phase simple solid solutions (HCP, BCC). Experimental results showed that the range of its occurrence is wider than previously thought, i.e. after annealing the 8CoCr phase was found above 44 at. % of Cr.

J	Pohlmann-Eden, B; Eden, SC; Smith, R				Pohlmann-Eden, Bernd; Eden, Silke C.; Smith, Rosie			Early communication is key - Designing a new communication tool to immediately empower people with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures; Document engineering; Empowerment; Prognosis	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; DIAGNOSIS; PNES; PREDICTORS; MANAGEMENT; TIME	Introduction: Patient empowerment and shared decision-making has been increasingly recognized as key factors for a favorable prognosis. This is particularly true in complex brain disorders such as psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) which go along with several challenges. People with PNES (PW-PNES) often feel lost in the healthcare system. Early clear communication is one of the few favorable prognostic variables. Our goal was to design a new ultrashort user-friendly communication tool allowing immediate patient empowerment. Methods: We conceptualized a design thinking process with patient engagement of PW-PNES. Together with a larger group of PW-PNES, we developed a comprehensive user-friendly 1-page document summarizing the key features of PNES. We applied document engineering (DE) as a cognitive science-based new methodology. Document engineering is well established in the aviation, oil, and mining industries and measurably reduces comprehension and performance errors. Results: The design thinking process encompassed 5 phases (empathize, ideate, define, prototype, and test). A prototype of a 1-page document, the 1-Pager-PNES, was created which contained the essential 7 domains organized in a simple structure such as a promise-question-answer (PQA) format. Information was kept poignant, complete, easy-to-read integrating cognitive principles to optimize navigation. The prototype "1-Pager-PNES" was subsequently tested in a 7-member focus group. All patients expressed significant improvement in understanding their disease and felt immediately empowered. Implementing their specific feedbacks, reiterative testing, and involving PNES experts resulted in the final version of the "1-Pager-PNES". Conclusion: A promising new communication tool reduced to 1-page only is introduced which improves patient guidance and enables better coping mechanisms with this complex disease. The patient/user is empowered quickly through finding answers to pressing questions. Our study is unique for three reasons: 1) it engaged patients in the developing process, 2) it produced a tool for immediate communication for PW-PNES, which follows principles of human behavior and cognitive science, and 3) it used cross-industry thinking. Despite all limitations, we consider our small pilot study an inspiration for future studies with focus on patient empowerment through user-friendly documents. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

J	Watson, C				Watson, Curtis			An Exploratory Study of Secondary Students' Judgments of the Relevance and Reliability of Information	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							OF-THE-LITERATURE; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; EPISTEMOLOGICAL BELIEFS; RESEARCH-PROJECT; COGNITIVE MODEL; DOCUMENT USE; CREDIBILITY; CRITERIA; WEB; SEEKING	This qualitative investigation is situated in the field of information seeking and use, and decision-making theory provided a framework for the study. In a naturalistic setting and across a range of curriculum areas, it investigated the behavior of secondary school students undertaking information search tasks. Research questions focused on students' criteria for assessing the relevance and reliability of information. Thirty-seven students between 14 and 17 years of age from a southeastern Australian school participated. The study collected data from journals; interviews, including video-stimulated recall interviews; think-aloud reports; video screen captures; and questionnaires. Data analysis culminated in grounded theory. Initial judgments of an item's relevance were based on comprehensibility, completeness of source, whether the item needed to be purchased, whether video sources were suitable, and whether factual or opinionative material met students' needs. Participants preferred information that provided topic overviews, information that linked to prior knowledge, and sources that treated topics in acceptable depth and were structured to facilitate accessibility. Students derived clues about reliability from URLs and considered the reputation of sources. The ability of an item to corroborate prior knowledge, its graphic design, its style of writing, and the perceived authority of its creators influenced participants' decisions about reliability.

Thinking about that, this paper proposes a solution to deal with this challenge through a compositional approach that explores the context information on hybrid models, called EXEHDA-HM. The proposed approach stands out by the design of a repository that supports three database models and by the compositional processing strategy based on rules. In our proposal, the applications can combine data stored on different bases in a single rule, which could enhance the identification of contextual situations. For the evaluation we designed and implemented some case studies on information security area, exploring the hybrid repository composed of relational, non-relational, and triple storage models. Our results demonstrate that was possible to identify richer situations with the data composition across more than one model and there are situations that can only be found through this composition.

Title Paper: Natural computing: A problem solving paradigm with granular information processing	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Natural computing; Granular computing; Soft computing; Hybrid model; Decision systems	ROUGH-FUZZY MLP; SETS	Natural computing, inspired by biological course of action, is an interdisciplinary field that formalizes processes observed in living organisms to design computational methods for solving complex problems, or designing artificial systems with more natural behaviour. Based on the tasks abstracted from natural phenomena, such as brain modelling, self-organization, self-repetition, self evaluation, Darwinian survival, granulation and perception, nature serves as a source of inspiration for the development of computational tools or systems that are used for solving complex problems. Nature inspired main computing paradigms used for such development include artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, rough sets, evolutionary algorithms, fractal geometry, DNA computing, artificial life and granular or perception-based computing. Information granulation in granular computing is an inherent characteristic of human thinking and reasoning process performed in everyday life. The present article provides an overview of the significance of natural computing with respect to the granulation-based information processing models, such as neural networks, fuzzy sets and rough sets, and their hybridization. We emphasize on the biological motivation, design principles, application areas, open research problems and challenging issues of these models. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Utilization-focused scientific policy advice: a six-point checklist	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Policy advice; science communication; interdisciplinary dialogue; knowledge utilization; government agencies; policy design	CLIMATE SCIENCE	Knowledge utilization depends on how well the scientific community communicates knowledge to its target audiences' needs. We argue that policy-relevant science communication can increase the real-life impact of scientific evidence by moving beyond political agenda-setting and providing concrete advice to policy drafters. Agenda-setting seeks to raise politicians' and the wider public's awareness of a problem (problem advice). However, for scientific evidence to translate into effective policy interventions, the scientific community and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) must also provide policy drafters with advice on policy design and implementation (policy advice). Political attention is volatile, and - except for particularly policy-driven and solution-focused actors - politicians have little incentive to address long-term issues such as climate change if voters do not punish short-term thinking. In contrast, the public administration (government agencies) carries out long-term expert work. Government agencies are therefore the primary recipients of evidence-based knowledge transfer that aims to create concrete policy solutions. We develop hands-on recommendations for tailoring scientific advice to the needs of policy drafters through a six-point checklist. Based on utilization-focused evaluation research, we argue that scientific evidence should not only address the causes of public problems but also the effectiveness of proposed policy solutions and the consequences of policy decisions. We also highlight the need to assess the political feasibility of a given policy proposal (potential oppositions and stumbling blocks) and its practical implementability (likely reaction of the target groups). Ensuring effective policy advice requires transdisciplinary dialogue between natural, social, and policy scientists, as well as dialogue between research and government agencies. Key policy insights There is a gap between public and political awareness of climate change issues and effective policy solutions. Due to their respective roles within the policy process, politicians and government agencies have different knowledge needs. In addition to providing politicians and the general public with problem advice, a specific form of policy advice, that is, policy-prescriptive evidence-based information, should be developed and provided for policy drafters within government agencies. Natural, social and policy scientists must team up to provide policy advice that is not only evidence-based but also utilization-focused.

While Information and Communication Technology is thought to affect health information disparities, it remains unclear whether it widens or narrows them. We aimed to examine how four types of communication media-face-to-face/telephone, E-mail, LINE, social network service (SNS)-modify the association between educational background and accessibility to useful health information in the personal network of Japanese adults. We used data from the third-wave Japanese Study on Stratification, Health, Income, and Neighborhood (J-SHINE) survey conducted in 2017, which targeted middle-aged adults living in four municipalities within Japanese metropolitan areas. The results demonstrated that SNS use moderated the gap between educational backgrounds, suggesting that SNS can be an interventional leverage to close a health-related information gap between socioeconomic positions.

A systematic review and qualitative synthesis of views about human papillomavirus testing	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Review						human papillomavirus; cervical screening; cervical cancer; systematic review	HPV INFORMATION NEEDS; PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT; DECISION AIDS; KNOWLEDGE; PREFERENCES; ATTITUDES; BORDERLINE; MANAGEMENT; BELIEFS; EDUCATION	BACKGROUND: A new protocol for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing within the UK cervical screening programme commenced in April 2011, creating new patient experiences. This is the first review to synthesise a substantial body of international evidence of women's information needs, views and preferences regarding HPV testing. We aimed to inform the development of educational materials to promote informed choice, reduce anxiety and improve disease control. METHODS: We searched 12 bibliographic databases. Two reviewers independently screened papers and assessed study quality; disagreements were resolved by discussion. Results were extracted verbatim and authors' findings treated as primary data. Studies were synthesised collaboratively using framework methods. RESULTS: We synthesised findings from 17 studies. Women had overwhelmingly negative concerns; an HPV diagnosis was daunting, had associated problems of disclosure of a sexually transmitted infection (STI), impacted on relationships and provoked fear of stigmatisation. Nevertheless, many thought HPV testing could be a preferable alternative to repeat cytology. Knowledge was poor; women struggled to interpret limited information in the context of existing knowledge about STIs and cervical cancer. CONCLUSION: Women are likely to be poorly informed, have limited understanding and many unanswered questions. This could increase anxiety and reduce ability to make informed choices, presenting a substantial challenge for those who design and provide information.

This phenomenon is called "short-term synaptic plasticity" and is shown at all synapses. While much work has been done to understand the mechanisms of short-term changes in the state of synapses, short-term plasticity is often thought of as a mechanistic consequence of the design of a synapse.

What the public think about participation in medical research during an influenza pandemic: an international cross-sectional survey	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Pandemic; Influenza; Clinical research; Preparedness; Public involvement; Informed consent; Research participation	INFORMED-CONSENT; CLINICAL-RESEARCH; CARE; VALIDATION; TRIALS	Objectives: The public and patients are primary contributors and beneficiaries of pandemic-relevant clinical research. However, their views on research participation during a pandemic have not been systematically studied. We aimed to understand public views regarding participation in clinical research during a hypothetical influenza pandemic. Study design: This is an international cross-sectional survey. Methods: We surveyed the views of nationally representative samples of people in Belgium, Poland, Spain, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, using a scenario-based instrument during the 2017 regional influenza season. Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted. Results: Of the 6804 respondents, 5572 (81.8%) thought pandemic-relevant research was important, and 5089 (74.8%) thought 'special rules' should be applied to make this research feasible. The respondents indicated willingness to take part in lower risk (4715, 69.3%) and higher risk (3585, 52.7%) primary care and lower risk (4780, 70.3%) and higher risk (4113, 60.4%) intensive care unit (ICU) study scenarios. For primary care studies, most (3972, 58.4%) participants preferred standard enrolment procedures such as prospective written informed consent, but 2327 (34.2%) thought simplified procedures would be acceptable. For ICU studies, 2800 (41.2%) preferred deferred consent, and 2623 (38.6%) preferred prospective third-party consent. Greater knowledge about pandemics, trust in a health professional, trust in the government, therapeutic misconception and having had ICU experience as a patient or carer predicted increased willingness to participate in pandemic-relevant research. Conclusions: Our study indicates current public support for pandemic-relevant clinical research. Tailored information and initiatives to advance research literacy and maintain trust are required to support pandemic-relevant research participation and engagement.

In the schematization process, preserving the relative position of nodes and the relative length of segments are considered highly important for constructing spatial cognition. Some researchers have regarded these as general principles of automated schematization. However, in-depth investigations into the conversion of these general principles into specific schematic network map designs are still lacking. This study aimed to empirically investigate how the two relative relations are preserved in existing manually produced schematic maps to better understand and interpret designer thinking. Official underground network maps of 32 cities were used in this study. The results revealed that (1) relative relations were largely preserved with a preservation ratio of approximately 80%, and the global preservation ratios of two relative relations were significantly higher than those of local preservation; (2) the preservation of relative position took priority over the preservation of relative length for the schematic maps with significant enlargement of dense regions; and (3) a reference object may be used for preserving relative relations, for example, the center region or major axis. The findings of this study will assist in developing and/or optimizing design rules for automated schematization while preserving relative relations.

While previous models have achieved remarkable successes, an important problem may still hinder their performances, that is, the sparsity of the real-world data. In this paper, we propose a novel counterfactual data augmentation framework to alleviate the problem of data sparsity. In specific, our framework contains a sampler model and an anchor model. The sampler model aims to generate high-quality user behavior sequences, while the anchor model is trained based on the original and new generated samples, and leveraged to provide the final recommendation list. To implement the sampler model, we first design four types of heuristic methods based on either random or frequency-based strategies. And then, to improve the quality of the generated sequences, we propose two learning-based samplers by discovering the decision boundaries or increasing the sample informativeness. At last, we build an RL based model to automatically determine where to edit the history behaviors and how many items should be replaced. Considering that the sampler model can be imperfect, we, at last, analyze the influence of the noisy information contained in the generated sequences on the anchor model in theory, and design a simple but effective method to better serve the anchor model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

This study aimed to design and validate the empowerment scale for the older individuals with COPD (ESOCOPD). Materials & methods: This study was conducted in two phases with a deductive-inductive approach: a qualitative phase for designing the tool (the grounded theory study re-analysis, a review of texts and interviews) and a quantitative phase for validation of the questionnaire (face and content validity and reliability). Reliability was determined by test-retest and Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results: Based on the results of the grounded theory study re-analysis and a review of texts and interviews, 47 items were designed, 14 of which were removed in the face and content validity assessment. The total Content validity index and content validity ratio of the questionnaire were found as 0.82 and 0.95, respectively.The final number of items in the scale was 33, and its dimensions included information seeking, achieving independence, learning to live with COPD, participation in care, having critical thinking, psychosocial capacities management, and achieving goals. Intra-class correlation of questionnaire dimensions was 0.86-0.99. Conclusions: The ESOCOPD can be used by health care and treatment providers to determine the patient's ability for self-care and disease management because of its small number of items, it's validation, and reliability.

Mobile health (mHealth) apps show promise in supporting self-management of chronic conditions such as type 1 diabetes. Many health care providers become involved in app development. Unfortunately, limited information is available to guide their selection of appropriate methods, techniques, and tools for a participatory design (PD) project in health care. Objective: The aim of our study was to develop an mHealth app to support young people in self-managing type 1 diabetes. This paper presents our methodological recommendations based on experiences and reflections from a 2-year research study. Methods: A mixed methods design was used to identify user needs before designing the app and testing it in a randomized controlled trial. App design was based on qualitative, explorative, interventional, and experimental activities within an overall iterative PD approach. Several techniques and tools were used, including workshops, a mail panel, think-aloud tests, and a feasibility study. Results: The final mHealth solution was "Young with Diabetes" (YWD). The iterative PD approach supported researchers and designers in understanding the needs of end users (ie, young people, parents, and health care providers) and their assessment of YWD, as well as how to improve app usability and feasibility. It is critical to include all end user groups during all phases of a PD project and to establish a multidisciplinary team to provide the wide range of expertise required to build a usable and useful mHealth app. Conclusions: Future research is needed to develop and evaluate more efficient PD techniques. Health care providers need guidance on what tools and techniques to choose for which subgroups of users and guidance on how to introduce an app to colleagues to successfully implement an mHealth app in health care organizations. These steps are important for anyone who wants to design an mHealth app for any illness.

Inhibiting their activities by the use of drug-like small chemical molecules is thought to be an efficient strategy in pesticide design and development. On the basis of the crystal structure of Of ChtI, a chitinase indispensable for the molting of the insect pest Ostrinia furnacalis (Asian corn borer), here we report a chemical fragment and five variant compounds as inhibitors of Of ChtI obtained from a library of over 200 000 chemicals by a structure-based-virtual-screening approach. The compounds were synthesized with high atom economy and tested for their. Of ChtI-inhibitory activities in a bioassay. Compound 3 showed preferential inhibitory activity with a K-i value of 1.5 mu M against Of ChtI. Analysis of the structure-activity relationships of the compounds provided insight into their interactions with the enzyme active site, which may inform future work in improving the potencies of their inhibitory activities.

Many health care programs that use RMT rely on commercially available, "off-the-shelf" devices to collect patient data. However, validation of these devices is sparse, the technology landscape is constantly changing, relative benefits between device options are often unclear, and research on patient and health care provider preferences is often lacking. Objective: To address these common challenges, we propose a novel device selection framework extrapolated from human-centered design principles, which are commonly used in de novo digital health product design. We then present a case study in which we used the framework to identify, test, select, and implement off-the-shelf devices for the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Central Nervous System (RADAR-CNS) consortium, a research program using RMT to study central nervous system disease progression. Methods: The RADAR-CNS device selection framework describes a human-centered approach to device selection for mobile health programs. The framework guides study designers through stakeholder engagement, technology landscaping, rapid proof of concept testing, and creative problem solving to develop device selection criteria and a robust implementation strategy. It also describes a method for considering compromises when tensions between stakeholder needs occur. Results: The framework successfully guided device selection for the RADAR-CNS study on relapse in multiple sclerosis. In the initial stage, we engaged a multidisciplinary team of patients, health care professionals, researchers, and technologists to identify our primary device-related goals. We desired regular home-based measurements of gait, balance, fatigue, heart rate, and sleep over the course of the study. However, devices and measurement methods had to be user friendly, secure, and able to produce high quality data. In the second stage, we iteratively refined our strategy and selected devices based on technological and regulatory constraints, user feedback, and research goals. At several points, we used this method to devise compromises that addressed conflicting stakeholder needs. We then implemented a feedback mechanism into the study to gather lessons about devices to improve future versions of the RADAR-CNS program. Conclusions: The RADAR device selection framework provides a structured yet flexible approach to device selection for health care programs and can be used to systematically approach complex decisions that require teams to consider patient experiences alongside scientific priorities and logistical, technical, or regulatory constraints.

A positive experience may encourage retention in the study, and participants may benefit in unanticipated ways. Objective To explore first-time mothers' experiences of taking part in a longitudinal cohort study and completing self-administered surveys during pregnancy and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months' postpartum. Design Content analysis of comments written by participants in the Maternal health And Maternal Morbidity in Ireland study's five self-completion surveys, a multisite cohort study exploring women's health and health problems during and after pregnancy. This paper focuses on what women wrote about taking part in the research. Ethical approval was granted by the site hospitals and university. Setting and participants A total of 2174 women were recruited from two maternity hospitals in Ireland between 2012 and 2015. Findings A total of 1000 comments were made in the five surveys. Antenatally, barriers related to surveys being long and questions being intimate. Postpartum, barriers related to being busy with life as first-time mothers. Benefits gained included gaining access to information, taking time to reflect, stopping to think and being prompted to seek help. Survey questions alone were described as valuable sources of information. Discussion and conclusions Findings suggest that survey research can "give back" to women by being a source of information and a trigger to seek professional help, even while asking sensitive questions. Understanding this can help researchers construct surveys to maximize benefits, real and potential, for participants.

Nevertheless, the functional role of prefrontal activity in this process is not fully understood. In this experiment we asked participants to evaluate ambiguous inkblots from the Rorschach test, while stimulating the left lateral PFC using excitatory anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In addition, visual insight ability was assessed as a control measure requiring visual and conceptual restructuring and convergent thinking rather than divergent idea generation employed to interpret the equivocal Rorschach inkblots. Using a randomized double-blind design, we demonstrated that anodal tDCS increased the number of meaningful patterns recognized in the inkblots but had no significant effect on visual insight. These findings support the role of left lateral PFC in the processing of ambiguous visual information and object recognition. More generally, we discuss that the PFC may be involved in the mechanisms supporting the activation of stored visual and semantic representations in order to compensate for less informative bottom-up inputs and thus facilitate flexible cognition and idea generation.

J	Zhu, YZ; Shen, XT; Ye, CQ				Zhu, Yunzhang; Shen, Xiaotong; Ye, Changqing			Personalized Prediction and Sparsity Pursuit in Latent Factor Models	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Alternating directions; Collaborative filtering; Content-based filtering; Partial latent models; Recommender; Sparse factorization		Personalized information filtering extracts the information specifically relevant to a user, predicting his/her preference over a large number of items, based on the opinions of users who think alike or its content. This problem is cast into the framework of regression and classification, where we integrate additional user-specific and content-specific predictors in partial latent models, for higher predictive accuracy. In particular, we factorize a user-over-item preference matrix into a product of two matrices, each representing a user's preference and an item preference by users. Then we propose a likelihood method to seek a sparsest latent factorization, from a class of overcomplete factorizations, possibly with a high percentage of missing values. This promotes additional sparsity beyond rank reduction. Computationally, we design methods based on a decomposition and combination strategy, to break large-scale optimization into many small subproblems to solve in a recursive and parallel manner. On this basis, we implement the proposed methods through multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming, and through Mahout, a library for scalable machine learning and data mining, for mapReduce computation. For example, our methods are scalable to a dataset consisting of three billions of observations on a single machine with sufficient memory, having good timings. Both theoretical and numerical investigations show that the proposed methods exhibit a significant improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art scalable methods.

The abnormally low sea water temperature periodically observed is thought to be related to the mortality of the abalone. A stock survey was carried out to design an effective management policy. Based on predictions of the sea water temperature and the results of the stock survey, we propose a management policy which controls the fishing mortality coefficient and the number of juveniles released. Simulations were conducted using estimated or assumed values of biological and operational parameters. Within the range of parameters used here, the results suggest the following: (1) The utilization of both sea water temperature and stock survey provides more accurate catch predictions than when using only sea water temperature. (2) When the sea water temperature is predicted accurately, decreasing the number of juveniles released and increasing the fishing if the stock is good brings good cathches.

An extended challenge-based framework for practice design in sports coaching	JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES			English	Article						Motor learning; practice conditions; skill acquisition; practice scheduling; transfer	DELIBERATE PRACTICE; CONTEXTUAL INTERFERENCE; IMPLICIT MEMORY; SELF-EFFICACY; INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; LEARNING DEPENDS; COGNITIVE EFFORT; WORKING-MEMORY; MOTOR; SKILL	The challenge-point framework as a model for thinking about motor learning was first proposed in 2004. Although it has been well-cited, surprisingly this framework has not made its way into much of the applied sport science literature. One of the reasons for this omission is that the original framework had not been encapsulated into a paper accessible for sports practitioners. The framework had mostly a theoretical focus, providing a mechanistic summary of motor learning research. Our aims in this paper were to explain and elaborate on the challenge point framework to present an applied framework guiding practice design. We connect the framework to other theories that involve predictive coding, where information is attended when it disconfirms current predictions, providing a strong signal for learning. We also consider how two new dimensions (learners' motivation and practice specificity) need to be considered when designing practice settings. By moving around the different dimensions of functional difficulty, motivation, and specificity, coaches can optimize practice to achieve different learning goals. Specifically, we present three general "types" of practice: practice to learn, to transfer to competition, and to maintain current skills. Practical examples are given to illustrate how this framework can inform coach practice.

J	Lugen, M				Lugen, Marine			Framing Climate Services: Logics, Actors, and Implications for Policies and Projects	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						climate services; climate information services; climate change adaptation; framing analysis; discourse analysis; climate policy	CHANGE ADAPTATION; INFORMATION; SCIENCE; VULNERABILITY; FORECASTS; FARMERS; NEEDS; RISK; AGRICULTURE; KNOWLEDGE	This paper explores how climate services are framed in the literature and possible implications for climate services' policies and projects. By critically exploring the frames around climate services, the wider objective is to encourage more reflexive and responsible research in the field, particularly given the huge challenge that climate change represents. By using a framing analysis based on an extensive literature review, five dominant frames were identified. Climate services are mainly framed (1) as a technological innovation, (2) as a market, (3) as an interface between users and producers, (4) as a risk management tool, and (5) from an ethical angle. The predominant frames influence how we think about climate services, shared assumptions, and the way in which policies and projects are designed. To prevent negative effects of climate services on the ground, such as inequalities, the main recommendations include establishing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary dialogues between different communities of practice and players, increasing empirical and social science research to improve our understanding of this new field, and finally, re-thinking climate services in terms of adaptation rather than as the mere production of new information products.

We agree with them that the advent of the digital age is calling for a reconsideration of the role of theory and theorizing. We also think their proposal does not go far enough. The time is ripe to question the role of theory in our field more fundamentally. We propose to instead focus on establishing IS research as a platform through which we can collect, organize, and provide access to digital trace data from various sources to analyze contemporary socio-technical phenomena. We believe that such a move allows us to more fully unleash the unique socio-technical competences of our field in the digital age.

Florian			Maintaining information about speech input during accent adaptation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							WORD RECOGNITION; TIME-COURSE; ENGLISH; MEMORY; VOICE; REPRESENTATIONS; DISCRIMINATION; EXPERIENCE; ATTENTION; CONTRAST	Speech understanding can be thought of as inferring progressively more abstract representations from a rapidly unfolding signal. One common view of this process holds that lower-level information is discarded as soon as higher-level units have been inferred. However, there is evidence that sub-categorical information about speech percepts is not immediately discarded, but is maintained past word boundaries and integrated with subsequent input. Previous evidence for such sub-categorical information maintenance has come from paradigms that lack many of the demands typical to everyday language use. We ask whether information maintenance is also possible under more typical constraints, and in particular whether it can facilitate accent adaptation. In a web-based paradigm, participants listened to isolated foreign-accented words in one of three conditions: subtitles were displayed concurrently with the speech, after speech offset, or not displayed at all. The delays between speech offset and subtitle presentation were manipulated. In a subsequent test phase, participants then transcribed novel words in the same accent without the aid of subtitles. We find that subtitles facilitate accent adaptation, even when displayed with a 6 second delay. Listeners thus maintained sub-categorical information for sufficiently long to allow it to benefit adaptation. We close by discussing what type of information listeners maintain-sub-categorical phonetic information, or just uncertainty about speech categories.	[Burchill, Zachary; Liu, Linda; Jaeger, T.

This hypothesis is controversial in part because it appears to deny the possibility of a universal groundwork for human cognition, and in part because some findings taken to support it have not reliably replicated. We argue that considering this hypothesis through the lens of probabilistic inference has the potential to resolve both issues, at least with respect to certain prominent findings in the domain of color cognition. We explore a probabilistic model that is grounded in a presumed universal perceptual color space and in language-specific categories over that space. The model predicts that categories will most clearly affect color memory when perceptual information is uncertain. In line with earlier studies, we show that this model accounts for language-consistent biases in color reconstruction from memory in English speakers, modulated by uncertainty. We also show, to our knowledge for the first time, that such a model accounts for influential existing data on cross-language differences in color discrimination from memory, both within and across categories. We suggest that these ideas may help to clarify the debate over the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.

This study adopts a quasi-experimental research design with a control group. We recruited a total of twenty-six sixth graders from a private school. The data collection instruments were Reflective Thinking Skill Scale towards Problem Solving, Academic Motivation Scale, Spatial Visualisation Scale, and Mental Rotation Scale. The experimental process lasted for four weeks. LEGO-based teaching aids were employed in the experimental group, whereas Scratch-based educational applications were used in the control group. Based on the findings, there was an increase in the reflective thinking skill towards problem solving as well as mental rotation and spatial visualisation skills of the students in both groups. However, it has been found that the mean scores of reflective thinking skill towards problem solving and spatial visualisation skills of the experimental group students are higher than those of the control group. We conclude that LEGO-based educational applications have a more positive impact on the development of reflective thinking skill towards problem solving and spatial visualisation skill compared with Scratch-based educational applications. According to our findings, we discuss limitations and provide recommendations for researchers and practitioners.

Health promotion planning frameworks such as Intervention Mapping provide helpful guidance in addressing various facets of the environmental context in health intervention design, including the environmental factors that influence a given health condition or behavior, environmental agents that can influence a population's health, and environmental change methods. In further exploring how to harness the environmental context for health promotion, we examine in this paper the concept of interweaving of health promotion into context, defined as weaving or blending together health promotion strategies, practices, programs, and policies to fit within, complement, and build from existing settings and environments. Health promotion interweaving stems from current perspectives in health intervention planning, improvement science and complex systems thinking by guiding practitioners from a conceptualization of context as a backdrop to intervention, to one that recognizes context as integral to the intervention design and to the potential to directly influence health outcomes. In exploring the general approach of health promotion interweaving, we examine selected theoretical and practice-based interweaving concepts in relation to four key environments (the policy environment, the information environment, the social/cultural/organizational environment, and the physical environment), followed by evidence-based and practice-based examples of health promotion interweaving from the literature. Interweaving of health promotion into context is a common practice for health planners in designing health promotion interventions, yet one which merits further intentionality as a specific health promotion planning design approach.

WKID Innovation, a framework to tackle wicked problems, is modeled after the National Aeronautic Space Administration's (NASA) science system engineering. NASA is a leader creating disruptive technologies that alter the way that people, companies, and industries operate. Since 1958, NASA has pioneered innovation to advance human knowledge, engineering the first human landing on the moon, successfully landing rovers on Mars, and leaving our solar system, literally going where no man has gone before. While driving innovation in new frontiers, NASA collects accurate, reliable Earth observations that change how we live. WKID Innovation is a framework to scale NASA processes for innovation, specifically by using the knowledge hierarchy to bridge design thinking and complex systems science to system engineer and manage disruptive innovation.

How Perspectives of a System Change Based on Exposure to Positive or Negative Evidence	SYSTEMS			English	Article						causal maps; case library; mental models; problem-based learning; systems representation	STRUCTURAL BALANCE; CASE LIBRARIES; MAPS; OBESITY; SCIENCE	The system that shapes a problem can be represented using a map, in which relevant constructs are listed as nodes, and salient interrelationships are provided as directed edges which track the direction of causation. Such representations are particularly useful to address complex problems which are multi-factorial and may involve structures such as loops, in contrast with simple problems which may have a clear root cause and a short chain of causes-and-effects. Although students are often evaluated based on either simple problems or simplified situations (e.g., true/false, multiple choice), they need systems thinking skills to eventually deal with complex, open-ended problems in their professional lives. A starting point is thus to construct a representation of the problem space, such as a causal map, and then to identify and contrast solutions by navigating this map. The initial step of abstracting a system into a map is challenging for students: unlike seasoned experts, they lack a detailed understanding of the application domain, and hence struggle in capturing its key concepts and interrelationships. Case libraries can remedy this disadvantage, as they can transfer the knowledge of experts to novices. However, the content of the cases can impact the perspectives of students. For example, their understanding of a system (as reflected in a map) may differ when they are exposed to case studies depicting successful or failed interventions in a system. Previous studies have abundantly documented that cases can support students, using a variety of metrics such as test scores. In the present study, we examine the ways in which the representation of a system (captured as a causal map) changes as a function of exposure to certain types of evidence. Our experiments across three cohorts at two institutions show that providing students with cases tends to broaden their coverage of the problem space, but the knowledge afforded by the cases is integrated in the students' maps differently depending on the type of case, as well as the cohort of students.

Metaheuristic algorithms have gained attention in this field in recent years. The grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) is a meta-heuristic algorithm recently proposed based on the migration and hunting of grasshoppers in nature. However, the method suffers from a low diversity of the agents, which results in the stagnation problems, or immature convergence. To make GOA more competent in various situations, this paper stabilizes an improved GOA with new exploratory and exploitative features, which we have called it the SCGOA. The mechanism and structure of the proposed SCGOA are mainly divided into two steps: First, to balance the exploration and exploitation stages, trigonometric substitution is utilized for perturbation of the updating (evolution) of the position vectors of the individuals. Secondly, the diversity of the population is boosted using can Cauchy mutation-based strategy, which can help the grasshopper population to avoid the stagnation and lazy convergence. Therefore, Cauchy mutation is introduced to assist in an adequate variety of the position of the grasshopper population. Performance of SCGOA was validated on the latest IEEE CEC2017 benchmark functions in comparison with several well-known meta-heuristic algorithms. Various extensive results reveal that the proposed SCGOA has achieved a significant advantage over the other rivals. Finally, the Cauchy mutation-based SCGOA was also used for tackling four engineering design problems, and the results showed that SCGOA was superior to some state-of-the-art algorithms. We also developed the binary version of Cauchy mutation-based SCGOA in dealing with many feature selection datasets. The results on feature selection reveal that the binary version can outperform original GOA and other optimization algorithms, with higher classification accuracy, smaller error rate, and less number of features. We think the proposed optimizer can be widely tool for solving forms of the optimization problems.

Design Randomised trial with eight groups (three factors, 2x2x2). Data collected at recruitment and three month follow-up. Participants 400 patients starting radiotherapy, Of whom 325 with breast or prostate cancer and complete anxiety and depression data were included in the analysis. Interventions Printed booklets: half had only general information from CancerBACUP about each patients cancer and half had personalised information from the patient's medical record plus selected general information; half were composed of information chosen interactively by the patient and half were produced automatically with a larger volume of material; mid half had additional advice on anxiety management. Main outcome measures Patients' views of the information, use of their booklets with others; change in reported social support; change in anxiety and depression. Results The larger booklets produced automatically were more likely to be found useful and to tell patients something new and less likely to be seen as too limited than the booklets produced interactively, but they were also more likely to overwhelm some patients. Personalised booklets were more likely than general booklets to tell patients something new. There was no difference in patients' perceived understanding of their cancer by any of the intervention factors. Patients with personalised information were more likely to show their booklets to others and to think it helped in discussing their, cancer or its treatment. There were no major differences in social support, anxiety, or depression by an), intervention factors. Conclusions Patients were more likely to show personalised information to their confidants than general information. Further research is needed into the effects of sharing information on patients' social Support and anxiety.

The Biochemical Literacy Framework: Inviting pedagogical innovation in higher education	FEBS OPEN BIO			English	Article						biochemistry; curriculum design; higher education; pedagogy; scientific literacy	DISCIPLINARY LITERACY; SCIENTIFIC LITERACY; UNDERLYING THEORIES; CRITICAL THINKING; BLOOMS TAXONOMY; STUDENTS; BIOLOGY; SCIENCE; SKILLS; CHEMISTRY	When developing meaningful curricula, institutions must engage with the desired disciplinary attributes of their graduates. Successfully employed in several areas, including psychology and chemistry, disciplinary literacies provide structure for the development of core competencies-pursuing progressive education. To this end, we have sought to develop a comprehensive blueprint of a graduate biochemist, providing detailed insight into the development of skills in the context of disciplinary knowledge. The Biochemical Literacy Framework (BCLF) aspires to encourage innovative course design in both the biochemical field and beyond through stimulating discussion among individuals developing undergraduate biochemistry degree courses based on pedagogical best practice. Here, we examine the concept of biochemical literacy aiming to start answering the question: What must individuals do and know to approach and transform ideas in the context of the biochemical sciences? The BCLF began with the guidance published by relevant learned societies - including the Royal Society of Biology, the Biochemical Society, the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Quality Assurance Agency, before considering relevant pedagogical literature. We propose that biochemical literacy is comprised of seven key skills: critical thinking, self-management, communication, information literacy, visual literacy, practical skills and content knowledge. Together, these form a dynamic, highly interconnected and interrelated meta-literacy supporting the use of evidence-based, robust learning techniques. The BCLF is intended to form the foundation for discussion between colleagues, in addition to forming the groundwork for both pragmatic and exploratory future studies into facilitating and further defining biochemical literacy.

The caregivers of children have a high demand for the presentation of text, pictures, and videos in three forms of popular healthcare science content. Caregivers placed significant importance on the popularization of safe medication usage for children. The survey results showed that the top 3 ways for caregivers to think that the quality of popular healthcare science content was "very good " came from medical institutions, medical staff notifications, and personal media, effectively increasing popular healthcare information accuracy. The intelligibility and pertinence of content expression are urgently needed within the caregiver population.Conclusion: Caregivers are very concerned about the popular science of safe medication for children, and are willing to learn about relevant content. Guided by the demand, we should actively disseminate accurate and easy-to-understand popular science about safe medication for children to caregivers through online or offline channels so as to promote safe medication for children.

J	Reichler, G; Dalton, S				Reichler, G; Dalton, S			Chefs' attitudes toward healthful food preparation are more positive than their food science knowledge and practices	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION			English	Article							NUTRITION	Objective To determine if chefs' and student chefs' attitudes, knowledge, and practices regarding healthful food preparation are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Design An analytical survey questionnaire was distributed to 4 chef groups. Sections 1 and 2 of the survey measured chefs food science knowledge (13 questions) and likelihood of using food preparation practices (15 questions) necessary to meet the 1990 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Section 3 (22 questions) measured chefs' attitudes toward nutrition in general, toward the importance of healthful food preparation practices, and toward the US Dietary Guidelines. Sample Of 512 surveys distributed by mail, at culinary meetings, and in classes at 2 culinary schools, 447 (86%) were returned (158 from practicing chefs and 289 from student chefs). Practicing chefs included chef educators, foodservice chefs from a national corporation, and indepen dent chef members of the American Culinary Federation of New York City. Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics included frequencies, means, and standard deviations of survey items and of individual survey sections. Reliability and validity were determined using a coefficients and principal components analysis. Analysis of variance was used to examine differences in practice, attitudes, and knowledge among chef groups. Results Both practicing chefs and student chefs answered more than 70% of the food science questions correctly, independent chefs scored significantly lower than educator and corporate chefs. More than two thirds of the chefs and student chefs correctly responded to questions about the nutrient composition of food and how cooking affects the nutrient content of food. All chef groups were confused about fat and cholesterol in food and in the body. Few healthful food preparation practices were likely to be used by any chef group more than two thirds of the time, although the subscale of the attitude toward the importance of these practices was very positive. The majority of practicing chefs thought that customers do not care about the US Dietary Guidelines and nutrition; student chefs thought that customers do care. Both groups strongly agreed that, as chefs, they are responsible For the nutritional content of the food they prepared. Application Both chefs and student chefs are willing to learn about food science and recipe modification principles as they apply to healthful cooking practices. The opportunities are clear. Dietitians have the expertise to teach chefs healthful food preparation techniques, recipe modification, and food composition information.

People in many low- and middle-income countries already suffer from several health challenges, such as malnutrition and a high occurrence of infectious diseases, challenges that will be intensified by climate change and variability. Furthermore, these countries often have health systems with a limited capacity to adapt to and prepare for future climate scenarios. As a result, many of the poorest and most vulnerable countries are likely to bear the brunt of health impacts resulting from climate change and variability. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identified health as the sector with the greatest potential to reduce the impacts of climate change in many lower- and middle-income countries if adaptation measures are taken. In this paper, we use case studies from a project funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to examine how to design programmes to reduce climate risks in the health sector. The USAID project called the Adaptation, Thought Leadership, and Assessment (ATLAS) Project and it assisted public health institutions in lower- and middle-income countries. Four specific cases are presented: in Mozambique, supporting the National Institute of Health of to launch a climate and health research observatory; in Ethiopia, working with the Ministry of Health to include climate and weather information into malaria early warning systems; in sub-Saharan Africa, improving our understanding of the relationship between temperature and malaria to inform malaria elimination interventions; and working across all project countries (globally) to manage extreme heat to reduce impacts on human health and well-being. We analyze these four ATLAS Project case examples to identify lessons and opportunities for future decisions and investment in climate and health care system management and capacity building programmes.

A cognitive systems engineering design approach to improve the usability of electronic order forms for medical consultation	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Referral and consultation; Cognitive systems engineering; Usability evaluation; Human factors; Medical order entry systems	HEALTH-CARE; PSYCHOMETRIC EVALUATION; PATIENT SAFETY; THINKING ALOUD; TASK-ANALYSIS; COMMUNICATION; TECHNOLOGY; MODEL; WORK	Background: During medical referrals, communication barriers between referring and consulting outpatient clinics delay patients' access to health care. One notable opportunity for reducing these barriers is improved usefulness and usability of electronic medical consultation order forms. The cognitive systems engineering (CSE) design approach focuses on supporting humans in managing cognitive complexity in sociotechnical systems. Cognitive complexity includes communication, decision-making, problem solving, and planning. Objective: The objective of this research was to implement a CSE design approach to develop a template that supports the cognitive needs of referring clinicians and improves referral communication. Methods: We conducted interviews and observations with primary care providers and specialists at two major tertiary, urban medical facilities. Using qualitative analysis, we identified cognitive requirements and design guidelines. Next, we designed user interface (UI) prototypes and compared their usability with that of a currently implemented UI at a major Midwestern medical facility. Results: Physicians' cognitive challenges were summarized in four cognitive requirements and 13 design guidelines. As a result, two UI prototypes were developed to support order template search and completion. To compare UIs, 30 clinicians (referrers) participated in a consultation ordering simulation complemented with the think-aloud elicitation method. Oral comments about the UIs were coded for both content and valence (i.e., positive, neutral, or negative). Across 619 comments, the odds ratio for the UI prototype to elicit higher-valenced comments than the implemented UI was 13.5 (95% CI = [9.2, 19.8]), p < .001. Conclusion: This study reinforced the significance of applying a CSE design approach to inform the design of health information technology. In addition, knowledge elicitation methods enabled identification of physicians' cognitive requirements and challenges when completing electronic medical consultation orders. The resultant knowledge was used to derive design guidelines and UI prototypes that were more useful and usable for referring physicians.

J	Markanday, A; Inoue, J; Dicke, PW; Thier, P				Markanday, Akshay; Inoue, Junya; Dicke, Peter W.; Thier, Peter			Cerebellar complex spikes multiplex complementary behavioral information	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							PURKINJE-CELLS; AUTORADIOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS; ACTION-POTENTIALS; PREDICTION ERROR; ORGANIZATION; DISCHARGE; RESPONSES; SIGNALS; SYSTEM; CAT	Purkinje cell (PC) discharge, the only output of cerebellar cortex, involves 2 types of action potentials, high-frequency simple spikes (SSs) and low-frequency complex spikes (CSs). While there is consensus that SSs convey information needed to optimize movement kinematics, the function of CSs, determined by the PCs climbing fiber input, remains controversial. While initially thought to be specialized in reporting information on motor error for the subsequent amendment of behavior, CSs seem to contribute to other aspects of motor behavior as well. When faced with the bewildering diversity of findings and views unraveled by highly specific tasks, one may wonder if there is just one true function with all the other attributions wrong? Or is the diversity of findings a reflection of distinct pools of PCs, each processing specific streams of information conveyed by climbing fibers? With these questions in mind, we recorded CSs from the monkey oculomotor vermis deploying a repetitive saccade task that entailed sizable motor errors as well as small amplitude saccades, correcting them. We demonstrate that, in addition to carrying error-related information, CSs carry information on the metrics of both primary and small corrective saccades in a time-specific manner, with changes in CS firing probability coupled with changes in CS duration. Furthermore, we also found CS activity that seemed to predict the upcoming events. Hence PCs receive a multiplexed climbing fiber input that merges complementary streams of information on the behavior, separable by the recipient PC because they are staggered in time.

J	Yan, ZG				Yan, Zhenggang			TODIM-VIKOR method for quality evaluation of tourism rural landscape planning and design with 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic numbers	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM); 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic sets (2TLNSs); TODIM; VIKOR; tourism rural landscape planning and design	GROUP DECISION-MAKING; FUZZY VIKOR	With the continuous deepening of the construction of urban-rural economic integration in China, rural construction activities supported by rural revitalization strategies have changed the development thinking of rural economy. While implementing the goal of rural ecological economy, optimizing the rural living environment has become one of the important contents of rural revitalization, including the planning and design of rural landscapes. Rural landscape planning and design need to comprehensively consider the adaptability of landscape and rural ecological environment, emphasize the impact of rural spatial structure differences on landscape planning and design, and achieve scientific and humanized landscape planning and design, thereby creating a more warm, natural, and comfortable rural living space. The quality evaluation of tourism rural landscape planning and design is a multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems. Recently, the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multicriteria decision making) and VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) method has been inaugurated to cope with MAGDM issues. The 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic sets (2TLNSs) are inaugurated as a effective tool for characterizing uncertain information during the quality evaluation of tourism rural landscape planning and design. In this paper, the 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic TODIM-VIKOR (2TLN-TODIM-VIKOR) method is inaugurated to solve the MAGDM under 2TLNSs. In the end, a numerical case study for quality evaluation of tourism rural landscape planning and design is inaugurated to confirm the proposed method.

No clone with the wild-type sequence was selected and most clones contained a sequence motif not found in the wild-type sequence. Two mimotopes (LYMPQLS, SEMPQLP) were synthesized which inhibited binding to the measles virus 95-135 times better than a wild-type peptide. Sequence comparison of proteins with known 3D-structure indicates that the epitope corresponds to an alpha-helix, while the best mimotopes have no predicted helix propensity. The proline is thought to be required for inducing a turn necessary for mimicking part of the alpha-helix. The higher intrinsic stability of such a mimotope may explain its improved binding and may be more suitable in immunogenicity experiments.

They can be employed prospectively or retrospectively to identify the mechanisms and consequences of policies or interventions designed to strengthen health systems and inform discussion with policymakers and stakeholders on actions that may alleviate sub-optimal outcomes. Whilst the use of CLDs in health systems research has generally increased, there is still limited use in low- and middle-income settings. In addition to their suitability for evaluating complex systems, CLDs can be developed where opportunities for primary data collection may be limited (such as in humanitarian or conflict settings) and instead be formulated using secondary data, published or grey literature, health surveys/reports and policy documents. The purpose of this paper is to provide a step-by-step guide for designing a health system research study that uses CLDs as their chosen research method, with particular attention to issues of relevance to research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The guidance draws on examples from the LMIC literature and authors' own experience of using CLDs in this research area. This paper guides researchers in addressing the following four questions in the study design process; (1) What is the scope of this research? (2) What data do I need to collect or source? (3) What is my chosen method for CLD development? (4) How will I validate the CLD? In providing supporting information to readers on avenues for addressing these key design questions, authors hope to promote CLDs for wider use by health system researchers working in LMICs.

A 30-year case study and 15 principles: Implications of an artificial intelligence methodology for functional modeling	AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Conceptual Design; Functional Modeling; Functional Reasoning; Functional Representation; Structure-Behavior-Function Models; Systems Thinking	KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION; GENERIC MECHANISMS; ENGINEERING DESIGN; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS; GENERATION; ONTOLOGY; ANALOGY	Research on design and analysis of complex systems has led to many functional representations with several meanings of function. This work on conceptual design uses a family of representations called structure-behavior-function (SBF) models. The SBF family ranges from behavior-function models of abstract design patterns to drawing-shape-SBF models that couple SBF models with visuospatial knowledge of technological systems. Development of SBF modeling is an instance of cognitively oriented artificial intelligence research that seeks to understand human cognition and build intelligent agents for addressing complex tasks such as design. This paper first traces the development of SBF modeling as our perspective on design evolved from that of problem solving to that of memory and learning. Next, the development of SBF modeling as a case study is used to abstract some of the core principles of an artificial intelligence methodology for functional modeling. Finally, some implications of the artificial intelligence methodology for different meanings of function are examined.

These are an essential part of variety evaluation with the key aim of the statistical analysis of these datasets to accurately estimate the variety by environment (VE) effects. It has previously been thought that the number of varieties in common between environments, referred to as "variety connectivity, " was a key driver of the reliability of genetic variance parameter estimation and that this in turn affected the reliability of predictions of VE effects. In this paper we have provided the link between the objectives of this work and those in model-based experimental design. We propose the use of the D-optimality criterion as a diagnostic to capture the information available for the residual maximum likelihood (REML) estimation of the genetic variance parameters. We demonstrate the methods for a dataset with pedigree information as well as evaluating the performance of the diagnostic using two simulation studies. This measure is shown to provide a superior diagnostic to the traditional connectivity type measure in the sense of better forecasting the uncertainty of genetic variance parameter estimates.

J	Sun, TL; Kuo, WL				Sun, TL; Kuo, WL			Visual exploration of production data using small multiples design with non-uniform color mapping	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						visual data mining; data visualization; production management	VISUALIZATION	Visual data mining may overcome some of the flexibility problem often suffered by computer-centered data mining approaches. This can happen because human beings are introduced to the information discovery loop to take advantage of their natural strength in creative thinking and rapid visual pattern recognition to discover information not defined a priori and to perform approximated reasoning that computer algorithms are hard to do. This paper presents a novel visual exploration approach for mining abstract, multi-dimensional data stored in tables in a relational database. The visual image is constructed by converting each table into a visualization unit called a table graph and then assembling these table graphs together to form a small multiples design. Different types of non-uniform color mappings to render this small multiples design could be automatically generated by minimizing the weight differences of colors in the visual image. These non-uniform color mappings are designed in such a way that the adjacent glyphs in a table graph that have near underlying values will be assigned with the same color. As such, visual patterns not able to see under the traditional uniform color mapping could be revealed. This enables the users to examine the input tables from different perspectives. The proposed flexible visualization method has been applied to generate visual images from which the users could quickly and easily compare the machine idle cost performances of alternative master production plans.

We suggest this classical view is increasingly obsolete: digital technologies are now creating and shaping physical reality. We call this phenomenon the ontological reversal. The ontological reversal is where the digital version is created first, and the physical version second (if needed).

The control function of the system is concentrated, which leads to poor system flow resistance and slower speed. In view of this problem, combined with the actual application requirements of underwater vehicle for submarine cable inspection, in this paper, a method of control system design based on modular thinking is proposed. Considering the nonlinear hydrodynamic factors, the four degree of freedom motion modeling method of vehicle is presented. The hardware part of the vehicle control system is decomposed into a series of standard modules according to the function. By using the method of modularization, the control system design of underwater vehicle for submarine cable inspection is designed. Experimental results show that the system has better anti-flow capability and faster speed.

Designing and Implementing Web-based Scaffolding Tools for Technology-Enhanced Socioscientific Inquiry	EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY			English	Article						Inquiry-based learning; Socioscientific inquiry; Scaffolding; Annotations; Technology-enhanced environments	MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS; LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS; KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION; SCIENCE; IMPACT; MANAGEMENT; PROMPTS; ISSUES	This study explores how web-based scaffolding tools provide instructional support while implementing a socio-scientific inquiry (SSI) unit in a science classroom. This case study focused on how students used web-based scaffolding tools during SSI activities, and how students perceived the SSI unit and the scaffolding tools embedded in the SSI activities. A web-based SSI unit was developed and utilized in a technology-enhanced science classroom, and included three types of embedded annotations (definition, background information, thinking questions). The fmdings of this study suggest that students benefitted from web-based annotated scaffoldings in their individual reading and group discussions. The effective use of hard scaffolding may have contributed positively to students' engagement in the SSI activities and allowed students to easily explore a variety of context-related hyperlinked resources. In addition, the hard scaffolding tools allowed the teacher greater flexibility to effectively monitor students' learning progress, evaluate students' understanding of the topic, and provide guidance as needed through questioning. A holistic and dynamic approach is recommended when teachers and instructional designers consider how web-based hard scaffolding tools might function to assist students' learning in SSI.

Objectives: Improve the care pathway experience of older cancer patients and explore lessons learned regarding how to engage this vulnerable group. Design: Experience-Based Co-Design. Setting and participants: Older cancer patients, their caregivers and healthcare professionals within colorectal and breast cancer care pathways. Interventions: Co-design quality improvement teams. Main outcome measures: Colorectal cancer care pathway touchpoints were (a) availability of a contact person during diagnostic, treatment and aftercare phases; (b) collaboration between physicians and different hospital departments; (c) continuous relationship with same physician; (d) respectful treatment; (e) and information transfer with primary care. Breast cancer care pathway touchpoints were (a) comprehensive information package and information provision, (b) care planning based on patient preferences, (c) continuity of patient-professional relationship and (d) specialized care in case of vulnerability. Challenges related to PPI included (a) ability of older cancer patients to be reflective, critical and think at a collective level; (b) gaining support and commitment of professionals; (d) overcoming cultural differences and power inequalities; and (e) involving researchers and facilitators with appropriate expertise and position. Conclusion: This multidisciplinary quality improvement project revealed several challenges of PPI with older cancer patients and their caregivers. Research teams themselves need to assume the role of facilitator to enable meaningful PPI of older cancer patients. Patient or Public Contribution: Patient and caregiver representatives and advocates were involved in the design, conduct, analysis, interpretation of the data and preparation of this manuscript.

There has been a pressing need for research that would shed light on factors - especially modifiable factors - that could reduce risks to human health. At least several hundred studies addressing the complex relationships among transmission of SARS-CoV2, air pollution, and human health have been published. However, these investigations are limited by available and consistent data. The project goal was to seek input into opportunities to improve and fund exposure research on the confluence of air pollution and infectious agents such as SARS-CoV-2. Thirty-two scientists with expertise in exposure science, epidemiology, risk assessment, infectious diseases, and/or air pollution responded to the outreach for information. Most of the respondents expressed value in developing a set of common definitions regarding the extent and type of public health lockdown. Traffic and smoking ranked high as important sources of air pollution warranting source-specific research (in contrast with assessing overall ambient level exposures). Numerous important socioeconomic factors were also identified. Participants offered a wide array of inputs on what they considered to be essential studies to improve our understanding of exposures. These ranged from detailed mechanistic studies to improved air quality monitoring studies and prospective cohort studies. Overall, many respondents indicated that these issues require more research and better study design. As an exercise to solicit opinions, important concepts were brought forth that provide opportunities for scientific collaboration and for consideration for funding prioritization. Further conversations on these concepts are needed to advance our thinking on how to design research that moves us past the documented limitations in the current body of research and prepares us for the next pandemic.

Background: Clinical reasoning and clinical thinking are essential elements in the advanced nursing clinical practice decision-making process. The quality improvement of care is related to the development of those skills. Therefore, it is crucial to optimize teaching strategies that can enhance the role of clinical reasoning in advanced clinical practice. Design: A scoping review was conducted using the framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley as a research strategy. Consistent with the nature of scoping reviews, a study protocol has been established. Methods: The studies included and analyzed in this scoping review cover from January 2016 to June 2022. Primary studies and secondary revision studies, published in biomedical databases, were selected, including qualitative ones. Electronic databases used were: CINAHL, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and OVID. Three authors independently evaluated the articles for titles, abstracts, and full text. Results: 1433 articles were examined, applying the eligibility and exclusion criteria 73 studies were assessed for eligibility, and 27 were included in the scoping review. The results that emerged from the review were inter-preted and grouped into three macro strategies (simulations-based education, art and visual thinking, and other learning approaches) and nineteen educational interventions. Conclusions: Among the different strategies, the simulations are the most used. Despite this, our scoping review reveals that is necessary to use different teaching strategies to stimulate critical thinking, improve diagnostic reasoning, refine clinical judgment, and strengthen decision-making. However, it is not possible to demonstrate which methodology is more effective in obtaining the learning outcomes necessary to acquire an adequate level of judgment and critical thinking. Therefore, it will be necessary to relate teaching methodologies with the skills developed.

J	Li, YK; Li, CG				Li, Yuke; Li, Chunguang			Synergies between Intrinsic and Synaptic Plasticity Based on Information Theoretic Learning	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NONLINEAR ADAPTIVE PREDICTION; EXCITABILITY; NEURONS; ALGORITHM	In experimental and theoretical neuroscience, synaptic plasticity has dominated the area of neural plasticity for a very long time. Recently, neuronal intrinsic plasticity (IP) has become a hot topic in this area. IP is sometimes thought to be an information-maximization mechanism. However, it is still unclear how IP affects the performance of artificial neural networks in supervised learning applications. From an information-theoretical perspective, the error-entropy minimization (MEE) algorithm has newly been proposed as an efficient training method. In this study, we propose a synergistic learning algorithm combining the MEE algorithm as the synaptic plasticity rule and an information-maximization algorithm as the intrinsic plasticity rule. We consider both feedforward and recurrent neural networks and study the interactions between intrinsic and synaptic plasticity. Simulations indicate that the intrinsic plasticity rule can improve the performance of artificial neural networks trained by the MEE algorithm.

In this paper we present an original method that takes into account design intents relative to sunlight, visibility and urban regulation. First df all we study how current CAD tools have considered these properties until now. Our conclusion is that the classical design/simulation/analysis process does not suit design practices, especially in the early stages. We think that an improved CAD system should offer the architect the option of manipulating abstract information such as design intents. We define an intent as a conceptual expression of constraints having an influence on the project. For instance, a visual intent will be stated with no reference to vision geometry: "from this place, I want to see the front of the new building". We show how to represent each of these constraints with a 3D volume associated to some characteristics. If some solutions exist, we are sure that they are included in these volumes. For physical phenomena we compute the volume geometry using the principles of inverse simulation. In the case of urban regulation we apply deduction rules. Design intents are solved by means of geometrical entities that represent openings or obstructions in the project. Computing constraint volumes is a way of guiding the architect in his exploration of solutions. Constraint volumes are new spaces that can restore the link between form and phenomenon in a CAD tool. Our approach offers the designer the possibility of manipulating design intents.

The tool was intended to support the compliance monitoring task of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). CITES Secretariat questioned the WEMS prototype due to the significant role it accorded to certain Non-governmental organizations in the information collection process. Subsequently, it led to the redesign of WEMS, where governments were the custodians of enforcement information. In this paper, we explain why the previous NGO based design of WEMS was a concern for CITES secretariat. We applied Q methodology, a research method used to study people's "subjectivity", to elicit the ways of thinking of wildlife conservation actors in India, Japan and Thailand, countries where the NGO based WEMS were intended to be piloted. Our analysis revealed four competing perspectives of wildlife conservation, namely ecocentrism, mix of neoliberalism and anthropocentrism, authoritarianism and scientific rationalism; each with a particular implication on the adoption of a decision support system to monitor wildlife crime. The findings of our study reveal that scientific experts cannot expect unwavering support from the other groups for their aspirations, though they agree that some form of science mechanism is one way forward in bringing a policy consensus. We conclude that transboundary enforcement information sharing is a complex problem where information system designers or policy makers alone cannot judge its acceptance within a policy context. Since very few studies have been carried out on linking the actor-belief dynamics in a decision support system and its use in environmental policy making within the context of a MEA, this study brings more insight in understanding the inherent policy challenges in information sharing within MEAs and broadly, across the disciplines of environmental governance.

Designing endocrine disruption out of the next generation of chemicals	GREEN CHEMISTRY			English	Article							POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; DEVELOPMENTAL EXPOSURE; XENOPUS-LAEVIS; TOXICITY; ESTROGEN; ZEBRAFISH; ACTIVATION; METABOLITES; DOCKING; ACID	A central goal of green chemistry is to avoid hazard in the design of new chemicals. This objective is best achieved when information about a chemical's potential hazardous effects is obtained as early in the design process as feasible. Endocrine disruption is a type of hazard that to date has been inadequately addressed by both industrial and regulatory science. To aid chemists in avoiding this hazard, we propose an endocrine disruption testing protocol for use by chemists in the design of new chemicals. The Tiered Protocol for Endocrine Disruption (TiPED) has been created under the oversight of a scientific advisory committee composed of leading representatives from both green chemistry and the environmental health sciences. TiPED is conceived as a tool for new chemical design, thus it starts with a chemist theoretically at "the drawing board." It consists of five testing tiers ranging from broad in silico evaluation up through specific cell- and whole organism-based assays. To be effective at detecting endocrine disruption, a testing protocol must be able to measure potential hormone-like or hormone-inhibiting effects of chemicals, as well as the many possible interactions and signaling sequellae such chemicals may have with cell-based receptors. Accordingly, we have designed this protocol to broadly interrogate the endocrine system. The proposed protocol will not detect all possible mechanisms of endocrine disruption, because scientific understanding of these phenomena is advancing rapidly. To ensure that the protocol remains current, we have established a plan for incorporating new assays into the protocol as the science advances. In this paper we present the principles that should guide the science of testing new chemicals for endocrine disruption, as well as principles by which to evaluate individual assays for applicability, and laboratories for reliability. In a 'proof-of-principle' test, we ran 6 endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that act via different endocrinological mechanisms through the protocol using published literature. Each was identified as endocrine active by one or more tiers. We believe that this voluntary testing protocol will be a dynamic tool to facilitate efficient and early identification of potentially problematic chemicals, while ultimately reducing the risks to public health.

Patient-centered design criteria for wearable seizure detection devicesl	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Seizure detection; Survey	HYPERMOTOR SEIZURES; CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY; ICTAL TACHYCARDIA; DETECTION SYSTEMS; VALIDATION; PREDICTION; FREQUENCY; ALGORITHM; PRESSURE; CHILDREN	Introduction: Epilepsy is a common neurological condition. Seizure diary reports and patient- or caregiver reported seizure counts are often inaccurate and underestimated. Many caregivers express stress and anxiety about the patient with epilepsy having seizures when they are not present. Therefore, a need exists for the ability to recognize and/or detect a seizure in the home setting. However, few studies have inquired on detection device features that are important to patients and their caregivers. Methods: A survey instrument utilizing a population of patients and caregivers was created to obtain information on the design criteria most desired for patients with epilepsy in regard to wearable devices. Results: One thousand one hundred sixty-eight-responses-were collected. Respondents thought that sensors for muscle signal (61.4%) and heart rate (58.0%) would be most helpful followed by the 02 sensor (41.4%). There was more interest in these three sensor types than for an accelerometer (25.5%). There was very little interest in a microphone (8.9%), galvanic skin response sensor (8.0%), or a barometer (4.9%). Based on a rating scale of 1-5 with 5 being the most important, respondents felt that "detecting all seizures" (4.73) is the most important device feature followed by "text/email alerts" (4.53), "comfort" (4.46), and "battery life" (4.43) as an equally important group of features. Respondents felt that "not knowing device is for seizures" (2.60) and "multiple uses" (2.57) were equally the least important device features. Average ratings differed significantly across age groups for the following features: button, multiuse, not knowing device is for seizures, alarm, style, and text ability. The p-values were all < 0.002. Eighty-two point five percent of respondents [95% confidence interval: 80.0%, 84.7%] were willing to pay more than $100 for a wearable seizure detection device, and 42.8% of respondents [95% confidence interval: 39.8%, 45.9%] were willing to pay more than $200. Conclusions: Our survey results demonstrated that patients and caregivers have design features that are important to them in regard to a wearable seizure detection device. Overall, the ability to detect all seizures rated highest among respondents which continues to be an unmet need in the community with epilepsy in regard to seizure detection. Additional uses for a wearable were not as important. Based on our results, it is important that an alert (via test and/or email) for events be a portion of the system. A reasonable price point appears to be around $200 to $300. An accelerometer was less important to those surveyed when compared with the use of heart rate, oxygen saturation, or muscle twitches/signals. As further products become developed for use in other health arenas, it will be important to consider patient and caregiver desires in order to meet the need and address the gap in devices that currently exist.

J	Vieira, AD; Anthony, R				Vieira, Andreia De Paula; Anthony, Raymond			Recalibrating Veterinary Medicine through Animal Welfare Science and Ethics for the 2020s	ANIMALS			English	Article						animal welfare; animal health; veterinary ethics; One Health; welfare technology and systems; veterinary education	PRECISION LIVESTOCK; ONE HEALTH; RESISTANCE; MULTIPLE; CONTEXT	Simple Summary This article emphasizes the importance of educating veterinarians and veterinary students in animal welfare science and veterinary ethics, so that they can ably advance pertinent scientific knowledge and promote ethical thinking as trusted animal advocates in the 2020s. In light of this public expectation, a number of challenges are raised for veterinarians and the veterinary profession. These challenges involve: (1) re-envisioning the nature of disease treatment that goes beyond traditional conceptions of health or clinical matters, and which include animal welfare; (2) re-imagining disease prevention at the intersection of animal-human-ecosystem health; (3) developing core competencies in animal welfare science and ethics in order to provide professional leadership in animal welfare; and (4) taking a more active role in the development of novel networked devices, monitoring technologies and automated animal welfare solutions, and understanding their effects on the welfare of animals, human-animal relationships, and the veterinary profession in general. Abstract What should leading discourses and innovation regarding animal welfare look like for the veterinary profession in the 2020s? This essay considers four main challenges into which veterinarians are increasingly being drawn, as they respond to increasing public expectation for them to be scientific and moral authorities in animal welfare in addition to their traditional role as trusted health experts. They include: (1) to go beyond traditional conceptions of health by adopting a holistic view that also considers animal welfare, not only disease treatment; (2) to reimagine their professional duties when it comes to disease prevention at the intersection of animal-human-ecosystem health; (3) to develop core competencies/proficiency in animal welfare science and ethics in order to navigate discourses concerning competing priorities and socio-political ideologies and to provide professional leadership in animal welfare; (4) to provide feedback on novel networked devices, monitoring technologies and automated animal welfare solutions and their impact on animals' welfare. To competently navigate the intricacies of the socio-political and connected world as trusted authorities and conduits for innovation in and through animal welfare, veterinarians and veterinary students are encouraged to: (a) develop core competencies in veterinary ethics, animal welfare science and deliberative capacities that are well-informed by current multidisciplinary frameworks, such as One Health; (b) engage interested parties in more effective collaboration and ethical decision-making in order to address animal welfare related concerns within their immediate sphere of influence (e.g., in a given community); and (c) participate in the process of engineering and technological design that incorporates animals' welfare data (such as their preferences) for real-time animal monitoring through adding animal scientific and values-aware evidence in information technology systems. In order to tackle these challenges, four pillars are suggested to help guide veterinarians and the veterinary profession. They are: Collaboration, Critical Engagement, Centeredness on Research, and Continuous Self-Critique.

This "default network'' has been functionally linked to the stream of thoughts occurring automatically in the absence of goal-directed activity and which constitutes an aspect of mental behavior specifically addressed by many meditative practices. Zen meditation, in particular, is traditionally associated with a mental state of full awareness but reduced conceptual content, to be attained via a disciplined regulation of attention and bodily posture. Using fMRI and a simplified meditative condition interspersed with a lexical decision task, we investigated the neural correlates of conceptual processing during meditation in regular Zen practitioners and matched control subjects. While behavioral performance did not differ between groups, Zen practitioners displayed a reduced duration of the neural response linked to conceptual processing in regions of the default network, suggesting that meditative training may foster the ability to control the automatic cascade of semantic associations triggered by a stimulus and, by extension, to voluntarily regulate the flow of spontaneous mentation.

J	Kim, JH; Jung, SY; Lee, WG				Kim, Jong Hye; Jung, Soon Young; Lee, Won Gyu			Design of contents for ICT literacy in-service training of teachers in Korea	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Country-specific development; Pedagogical issues		The importance of ICT literacy education for students and teachers in the information society cannot be overemphasized. The Korean government had developed an ICT literacy curriculum for students and teachers since 2000. It announced the ICT literacy curriculum for students in 2000 and the ISST for teachers in 2002. Most contents of the ICT literacy curriculum and ISST focused on teaching the use of application programs. However, as the IT environment changes rapidly, the parties concerned thought that the revision of the ICT literacy curriculum and ISST is indispensable. Therefore, the Korean government announced the revised ICT literacy curriculum for students in 2005. The revised ICT literacy curriculum emphasized the principles of computer science and problem-solving methods. However, although the ICT literacy curriculum was revised, there was no ICT literacy inservice training curriculum to reflect the revised ICT literacy curriculum. In this research, we designed the contents of the ICT literacy in-service training program based on the revised ICT literacy curriculum. The contents of the ICT literacy in-service training program consist of four sections: the Information society, information devices, Information processing, and Information handling. The contents in each section of the ICT literacy in-service training curriculum are divided into two groups: mandatory and optional. There were several findings made in this study. After analyzing the opinions and requirements of experts and teachers, the 'Information processing' section was found to be the most important part of the ICT literacy in-service training program. It was found that the experts and teachers have different views on the contents of the ICI' literacy in-service training program. Also, we found that effective teaching strategies and evaluation methods should be provided for the ICT literacy in-service training curriculum to be effective. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It is important that the user-facing display of AI output facilitates clinical thinking and workflow for all disciplines involved in bedside care.Objectives Our objective is to engage multidisciplinary users (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) in the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) to present an AI-derived risk score.Methods Intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians participated in focus groups seeking input on instability risk forecast presented in a prototype GUI. Two stratified rounds (three focus groups [only nurses, only providers, then combined]) were moderated by a focus group methodologist. After round 1, GUI design changes were made and presented in round 2. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and deidentified transcripts independently coded by three researchers. Codes were coalesced into emerging themes.Results Twenty-three ICU clinicians participated (11 nurses, 12 medical providers [3 mid-level and 9 physicians]). Six themes emerged: (1) analytics transparency, (2) graphical interpretability, (3) impact on practice, (4) value of trend synthesis of dynamic patient data, (5) decisional weight (weighing AI output during decision-making), and (6) display location (usability, concerns for patient/family GUI view). Nurses emphasized having GUI objective information to support communication and optimal GUI location. While providers emphasized need for recommendation interpretability and concern for impairing trainee critical thinking. All disciplines valued synthesized views of vital signs, interventions, and risk trends but were skeptical of placing decisional weight on AI output until proven trustworthy.Conclusion Gaining input from all clinical users is important to consider when designing AI-derived GUIs. Results highlight that health care intelligent decisional support systems technologies need to be transparent on how they work, easy to read and interpret, cause little disruption to current workflow, as well as decisional support components need to be used as an adjunct to human decision-making.

J	Viswanathan, V; Linsey, J				Viswanathan, Vimal; Linsey, Julie			Spanning the complexity chasm: A research approach to move from simple to complex engineering systems	AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Cognitive-Artifact Study; Complex Systems; Conceptual Design; Mixed Methods; Physical Models	MIXED-METHODS; IDEA GENERATION; DESIGN; KNOWLEDGE; EXAMPLES; OBJECTS	A multistudy approach is presented that allows design thinking of complex systems to be studied by triangulating causal controlled lab findings with coded data from more complex products. A case study illustration of this approach is provided. During the conceptual design of engineering systems, designers face many cognitive challenges, including design fixation, errors in their mental models, and the sunk cost effect. These factors need to be mitigated for the generation of effective ideas. Understanding the effects of these challenges in a realistic and complex engineering system is especially difficult due to a variety of factors influencing the results. Studying the design of such systems in a controlled environment is extremely challenging because of the scale and complexity of such systems and the time needed to design the systems. Considering these challenges, a mixed-method approach is presented for studying the design thinking of complex engineering systems. This approach includes a controlled experiment with a simple system and a qualitative cognitive-artifacts study on more complex engineering systems followed by the triangulation of results. The triangulated results provide more generalizable information for complex system design thinking. This method combines the advantages of quantitative and qualitative study methods, making them more powerful while studying complex engineering systems. The proposed method is illustrated further using an illustrative study on the cognitive effects of physical models during the design of engineering systems.

We aimed to develop and pilot-test different written patient information materials explaining confidence intervals in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Further, a questionnaire on comprehension of confidence intervals was developed and piloted. Methods: We developed different patient information versions aiming to explain confidence intervals. We used an illustrative example to test three different approaches: (1) short version, (2) "average weight" version and (3) "worm prophylaxis" version. Interviews were conducted using think-aloud and teach-back approaches to test feasibility and analysed using qualitative content analysis. To assess comprehension of confidence intervals, a six-item multiple choice questionnaire was developed and tested in a pilot randomised controlled trial using the online survey software UNIPARK. Here, the average weight version (intervention group) was tested against a standard patient information version on confidence intervals (control group). People with multiple sclerosis were invited to take part using existing mailing-lists of people with multiple sclerosis in Germany and were randomised using the UNIPARK algorithm. Participants were blinded towards group allocation. Primary endpoint was comprehension of confidence intervals, assessed with the six-item multiple choice questionnaire with six points representing perfect knowledge. Results: Feasibility of the patient information versions was tested with 16 people with multiple sclerosis. For the pilot randomised controlled trial, 64 people with multiple sclerosis were randomised (intervention group: n = 36; control group: n = 28). More questions were answered correctly in the intervention group compared to the control group (mean 4.8 vs 3.8, mean difference 1.1 (95 % CI 0.42-1.69), p = 0.002). The questionnaire's internal consistency was moderate (Cronbach's alpha = 0.56). Conclusions: The pilot-phase shows promising results concerning acceptability and feasibility. Pilot randomised controlled trial results indicate that the patient information is well understood and that knowledge gain on confidence intervals can be assessed with a set of six questions.

"I don't think the problem's the student horizontal ellipsis I think it's us": Engaging faculty in curriculum innovation	JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION			English	Article						curriculum development; needs assessment; predoctoral education; program outcomes; qualitative methods	DENTAL EDUCATION	Purpose The need to innovate predoctoral dental education is well established; however, there are few recent reports to guide substantial curriculum transformation. The purpose of this study was to describe faculty perspectives on their vision of future graduates, curriculum needs, and potential barriers to a successful redesign. This information would be used to inform strategic planning for the predoctoral curriculum transformation. Methods Eighty full-time faculty from the University of North Carolina Adams School of Dentistry participated in 60-minute focus groups in March 2018. Focus group questions were developed to elicit perceptions about the current curriculum, what the dental graduate should know in 2040, and what is needed to engage faculty in curriculum change. Transcripts of the focus group sessions were analyzed by a third-party research group using qualitative thematic analysis to identify pertinent themes shared by participants. Results Faculty identified that developing clinical skill that engages multiple specialties, student time to engage in advocacy activities, and opportunities to integrate biomedical, clinical, and behavioral sciences as critical features of the curriculum. They believed the 2040 graduate should be able to critically evaluate literature, exhibit strong leadership skills, and adapt to the changing healthcare environment. To better engage faculty in curriculum change, there needs to be dedicated time, sufficient resources, a clear plan, and greater collaboration across the school. Conclusion When embarking on curriculum transformation, engagement with faculty is a critical component of the change process. Focus groups can be used as a technique to better understand faculty perspectives about curricular needs and the overall vision.

A cross-sectional study	HEALTH EXPECTATIONS			English	Article						attitude to health; consumer health information; health communication; health literacy; patient education as topic		Background Patients need medication and medical condition-related information to better self-manage their health. Health-care professionals (HCPs) should be able to actively provide information outside of one-on-one consultations; however, patient consent may be required. Objective To investigate the Australian public's preferences, and factors that may influence their preferences, towards an opt-in versus an opt-out approach to health communication. Design A cross-sectional study using a structured questionnaire administered via Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing. Setting and participants Participants across Australia who were adults, English-speaking and had a long-term medical condition. Main outcome measures Preferences for opt-in vs opt-out approach to receiving follow-up tailored information. Results A total of 8683 calls were made to achieve the required sample size of 589 completed surveys. Many (346/589; 58.7%) indicated that they were interested in receiving tailored, ongoing follow-up information from their HCP. Nearly half (n = 281; 47.7%) preferred an opt-in service and 293/589 (49.7%) an opt-out service for receiving follow-up information. Reasons for preferring an opt-in service were being in control of the information received (n = 254); able to make a decision that is best for them (n = 245); opt-in service would save time for HCPs (n = 217); they may not want or need the information (n = 240). Many (n = 255) felt that an opt-out service should be part of the normal duty of care of their HCP and believed (n = 267) that this approach would ensure that everyone has access to information. Conclusions Respondents were interested in receiving tailored information outside of consultation times. However, preferences for an opt-in or opt-out approach were divided.

In order to understand the most widely used digital technology products and their impact on students' creativity, 61 articles indexed by the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) were reviewed. Our review revealed that the articles investigated six categories of digital technology products (information saving-sharing, digital gaming, digital design, digital writing, robotics, and virtual learning environment), used four methods to measure students' creativity (students' creative characteristics, outputs, process, and learning environment), and analyzed five ways that digital technology products influence students' creativity (increasing motivation, professional activities, higher order thinking, creative cooperation, and cognitive load). Our analysis of the literature indicates that the impact of digital technology products on students' creativity is mixed and depends on teaching strategies and learning behaviors. We identify research challenges and important areas for future research.

TAYLOR LECTURE: YUCCA MOUNTAIN RADIATION STANDARDS, DOSE/RISK ASSESSMENTS, THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX, EVALUATIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						regulations; risk estimates; safety standards; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements	I-129; C-14	The Yucca Mountain high-level radioactive waste repository is designed to contain spent nuclear fuel and vitrified fission products. Due to the fact that it will be the first such facility constructed anywhere in the world, it has proved to be one in which multiple organizations, most prominently the U.S. Congress, are exercising a role. In addition to selecting a site for the facility, Congress specified that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) promulgate the associated Standards, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission establish applicable Regulations to implement the Standards, and the U.S. Department of Energy (U.S. DOE) design, construct, and operate the repository. Congress also specified that U.S. EPA request that the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) provide them guidance on the form and nature of the Standards. In so doing, Congress also stipulated that the Standards be expressed in terms of an "equivalent dose rate." As will be noted, this subsequently introduced serious complications.Due to the inputs of so many groups, and the fact that the NAS recommendations conflicted with the Congressional stipulation that the limits be expressed in terms of a dose rate, the outcome is a set of Standards that not only does not comply with the NAS recommendations, but also is neither integrated, nor consistent. The initial goals of this paper are to provide an independent risk/dose analysis for each of the eight radionuclides that are to be regulated, and to evaluate them in terms of the Standards. These efforts reveal that the Standards are neither workable nor capable of being implemented. The concluding portions of the paper provide guidance that, if successfully implemented, would enable U.S. DOE to complete the construction of the repository and operate it in accordance with the recommendations of NAS while, at the same time, provide a better, more accurate, understanding of its potential risks to the public. This facility is too important to the U.S. nuclear energy program to be impeded by inappropriate Standards and unnecessary regulatory restrictions. As will be noted, the sources of essentially all of the recommendations suggested in this paper were derived through applications of the principles of good science, and the benefits of "thinking outside the box."

In this article, we discuss data as an engineering tool and propose to use data throughout the asset's whole life cycle from identifying the need, planning and designing to construction, operation, integration and maintenance. This requires systems thinking where focus is not limited to the problems but rather constructs a systemic perspective to understand the interrelationships between components and systems. Future infrastructure is connected, intelligent and data-driven. To enable more sustainable decision-making, we should not only consider how to integrate different infrastructure elements but also use data to monitor, learn from and inform decisions. To this end, we present a case study where several assets, such as bridges, railways and transport systems are integrated, and data are curated for the purpose of aiding climate-conscious, sustainable decision-making. An example systems architecture for integration of different digital twins is explained and benefits of this data-driven, systemic perspective are discussed.

Using data from a national survey of state legislators, we examine whether entrepreneurs shape the legislative agenda on disaster preparedness and relief, which types of entrepreneurs are most influential, and what strategies they use in their interactions with legislators. The results indicate that legislators who report contact with policy entrepreneurs are more likely to have introduced related legislation, evidence of the important link between entrepreneurs and policy change. While entrepreneurs utilize a variety of different strategies, the analysis reveals policymakers are particularly receptive to entrepreneurs who provide new and reliable information. This finding suggests the influence of entrepreneurs lies not only in their ability to define problems and build coalitions, but also in their distinctive ability to provide information to elected officials, an important role that has largely been overlooked by existing literature.

Designing Technology to Address Parent Uncertainty in Childhood Cancer	ADVANCES IN NURSING SCIENCE			English	Article						mobile application; childhood cancer; uncertainty	INTERDISCIPLINARY INTERVENTION; CHILDREN; STATISTICS; MOTHERS	The stress and uncertainty created by a child's cancer diagnosis and treatment can affect parent and child functioning. Health technology provides a potential avenue for intervention delivery. Interviews were conducted with parents of children diagnosed with cancer to discover their needs following diagnosis and design a relevant mobile application. Treatment experience was the overarching theme. Subthemes included the emotional response, use of information, and environmental factors. Technology was used primarily to seek out information and communicate with others. Health technologies are gaining popularity and have the potential to be beneficial for patients and families throughout the treatment experience.

This paper looks at how three search engines, AltaVista, Yahoo and Infoseek presented their information to a small group of visually impaired and blind users and how accessible individual Internet pages are. Two participants had varying levels of partial sight and two Subjects were blind and solely reliant on speech synthesis output. Subjects were asked for feedback on interface design at various stages of their search and any problems they encountered were noted. The barriers to access that were found appear to come about by lack of knowledge and thought by the page designers themselves. An accessible page does not have to be dull. By adhering to simple guidelines, visually impaired users would be able to access information more effectively than would otherwise be possible. Visually disabled people would also have the same opportunity to access knowledge as their sighted colleagues.

J	Shealy, T; Katz, A; Godwin, A; Bell, M				Shealy, Tripp; Katz, Andrew; Godwin, Allison; Bell, Michael			Civil Engineering Students' Beliefs about Global Warming and Misconceptions about Climate Science	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article							CONCEPTIONS; ENVIRONMENT; CONSEQUENCES; SCIENTISTS	Civil engineers will face increasing challenges in their careers due to climate change. The infrastructure they design and construct will directly contribute to or mitigate it. Action to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change requires both a belief in human-caused global warming and a basic understanding of climate science. To understand which current engineering education efforts are successful or may need more consideration, a national sample of civil engineering students and students from other engineering disciplines was asked about their belief in global warming, understanding of greenhouse gases, the causes of global climate change, and ways to help reduce or slow it. The overwhelming majority of civil engineering students (83%) and students from other engineering disciplines (81%) acknowledged that global warming is happening. Nearly three of every four civil engineering students (73.5%) and other engineering students (71.3%) believed that global warming is caused by humans. However, only about half of civil engineering students (55.6%) and other engineering students (52.3%) felt that global warming is personally important. The majority of civil engineering students and other engineering students did not understand the causes and actions to reduce global warming. More than half of civil engineering students (60%) believed that nuclear power generation is a cause of global warming, which is significantly more than students from other engineering disciplines (52.6%). More than 8 of every 10 civil engineering students (83%) incorrectly believed or were unsure that the ozone hole in the upper atmosphere is a cause of global warming. A possible explanation for these misconceptions is that civil engineering students recognized general problems, such as nuclear waste and the ozone hole, but they did not link particular causes with particular consequences. Possible interventions were discussed for making climate change information personally relevant to engage students to think about cause and effect related to the climate.

Especially, the color coordination system that connects colors with impressions is expected as the system supporting the color design. Therefore, in the field of the KANSEI engineering, researches that model the correlation of colors (the arrangement of the color) and impression words have been done. However, the impression received from the color is various by individual, therefore, it is necessary to model the KANSEI information to each individual. In this paper, we analyze the data of the evaluation questionnaire of the color for the subject, and propose the method of extracting the KANSEI information of the subject. Concretely, by using the multivariable analysis, the correlation with an amount of the sensibility and the color feature is found. As a result, it is thought that the tendency of impressions to colors can be expressed in the sight.

Our research focuses on so-called information production processes: the primary processes of organizations delivering products consisting of information. In our search for tools to support BPR in this area, we used logistics to design a business modeling language that supports BPR.

MethodsFollowing a systematic review, we interviewed people with mild dementia, family carers and hospital professionals in England. We then held co-design workshops with family carers and hospital professionals. In parallel with the workshops, we used a matrix to synthesize data from all studies and to develop a decision guide prototype. The prototype was iteratively refined through further co-design workshops and discussions among researchers and Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) representatives. We conducted user testing for final feedback and to finalize the decision guide. ResultsMost participants acknowledged the limited benefits of tube feeding and would not use or want it for someone with severe dementia. However, they found decision-making processes and communication about nutrition and hydration were emotionally demanding and poorly supported in acute hospitals. The co-design groups developed the aims of the decision guide to support conversations and shared decision-making processes in acute hospitals, and help people reach evidence-based decisions. It was designed to clarify decision-making stages, provide information and elicit the values/preferences of everyone involved. It encouraged person-centred care, best-interests decision-making and multidisciplinary team working. From user testing, family carers and hospital professionals thought the decision guide could help initiate conversations and inform decisions. The final decision guide was disseminated and is being used in clinical practice in England. ConclusionWe used rigorous and transparent processes to co-design the decision guide with everyone involved. The decision guide may facilitate conversations about nutrition and hydration and help people reach shared decisions that meet the needs and preferences of people with severe dementia. Future evaluation is required to test its real-world impacts.

So we have to think about new access networks, which cover the needs in bandwidth, quality of service and bring the three today's networks-cable-tv, telephone networks and Internet-together. The Quality of Service and Security needs depend on each other in those networks. The demands to security devices in such networks are extraordinary high. Already simple packet filtering decreases the throughput in routers or gateways to non acceptable rates. Linux include a powerful packet filtering software, -iptables-, that is used in small and medium networks for firewalls, and workstations. The aim of this paper is to present solvations for packet filter improvements. The paper point out two alternatives: software improvements and filter rules reorganization and will focus on reorganization if filter rules. We describe an automatic filter configuration for Linux packet filter based on connection parameters.

J	Shen, JB; Tan, LW; Wang, YK				Shen, Jianbo; Tan, Liwei; Wang, Yingkuan			Design and implementation of international agricultural and biological engineering expert management system based on WEB mode	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						agricultural and bioengineering engineering; expert management; WEB mode; conditional search; think tanks; Asp.net MVC; bootstrap; entity framework technology		Agriculture and biological engineering are the foundation of agricultural modernization, and related countries have also issued relevant policies to guide the development of agriculture and biotechnology. Agricultural and biological engineering experts are the intellectual resources in the field. At present, there is less research on the management and maintenance of agricultural and biological engineering experts, and there is a lack of software systems in this area. In order to realize the management and maintenance of agricultural and biological engineering expert information, a service platform for the international agricultural and biological engineering expert system based on the B/S framework has been developed. The background of the system used C# as the development language, and the foreground used JavaScript technology and Bootstrap. The software adopted ASP NET MVC as the web development framework and used the Entity Framework to operate the SQL Server background database. The system has the function of searching and querying agricultural and biological engineering expert information according to keywords, and implements the functions of adding, deleting, and modifying data records, and the function of generating spreadsheets and importing spreadsheet data. The development of this system provides effective management tools for the maintenance and construction of agricultural and biological engineering expert databases and lays a good foundation for the construction of agricultural and biological engineering think tanks.

J	LeRouge, C; Ma, J; Sneha, S; Tolle, K				LeRouge, Cynthia; Ma, Jiao; Sneha, Sweta; Tolle, Kristin			User profiles and personas in the design and development of consumer health technologies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Aged; Health care; Information technology; Medical informatics; Consumer health technologies; User profile; Persona; Methodology; China; Diabetes	OLDER-ADULTS; SELF-MANAGEMENT; CHRONIC ILLNESS; SOCIAL SUPPORT; INFORMATION; PERCEPTIONS; CARE; PREVALENCE; INTERNET; COMORBIDITY	Background: "The graying of the globe" has resulted in exponential rise in health care expenses, over-worked health care professionals and a growing patient base suffering from multiple chronic diseases, one of which is diabetes. Consumer health technologies (CHT) are considered important catalysts for empowering health care consumers to take a proactive role in managing their health and related costs. Adoption rate and usability of such devices among the aging is far from being satisfactory. Past studies noted the motivation for adoption by the aging is dependent on the suitability/relevance, perceived usability and anticipated benefits associated with usage of technological innovation. Traditional information technology (IT) development adopts a systematic approach without necessarily using a specific user model that personalizes the system to the aging user groups. The aging patient population has unique needs arising from progressive deterioration in both physiological and psychological abilities. These needs are often ignored in the design, development, trial and adoption of consumer health products resulting in low adoption and usage. Objectives: The main objective of this research is to investigate the user-centered design (UCD), specifically user profiles and personas, as methodological tools to inform the design and development of CHT devices for an aging population. The adoption of user profile and persona has not received much attention in health care informatics research and, in particular, research involving CHT. Our work begins to fill this void in three ways. We (1) illuminate the process of developing CHT user profiles and personas for a Chinese elder population with a demanding health care needs, i.e., self-management of chronic diabetes, with the hope that the resulting profiles and personas may be used as foundational material for informing the design, development and evaluation of CHT in other similar contexts; (2) call attention to how to further enhance and complement traditional user profile and persona techniques for CHT design by integrating cognitive structures and present behavior that drive health care thinking, future behavior and demand; (3) show how the profiles and personas can be used to inform requirements, design and implementation decisions for a technology aimed at facilitating CHT adoption and diffusion for the elderly. Methodology: To exemplify process and application, we use an action-research methodology, where user profiles and personas of an aging patient population were developed. The resultant profiles and personas were leveraged to improve the design, development and implementation plans of a smart phone application to assist chronically ill aging Chinese diabetic population capable of disease self-management. Results: The results from the study show that user profile and persona can be a valuable methodological approach in capturing the conceptual model of the aging and informing the design and development decisions of CHT. The demonstration of techniques used in this study can serve as a guideline to CHT developers in bringing conceptual user modeling into the design of software interfaces targeted for users with specific health care needs. Specifically, the study provides guidance on the creation and use of profiles and personas to tap into the conceptual models of the targeted elderly population reflecting their preferences, capabilities and attitudes towards using technology in self-management care in general and the smart phone diabetes management application in particular. Insight into the mental model of the aging group has been shown to inform later stages of UCD development (e.g., the creation of prototypes and usability testing) as well as implementation and adoption strategies. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that by 2025, 80% of all new cases of diabetes are expected to appear in the developing countries. In fact, the number of diabetic patients in China is estimated to rise to 42.3 million in 2030 from 20.8 million in 2000. Thus, we investigate the Chinese aging population in order to demonstrate the process of developing and using user profile and persona. We hope that the resultant conceptual model of the Chinese aging diabetic population can be used in future research to guide CHT designers interested in designing health care devices for this vulnerable user group.

J	Chin, MY; Cohen, CAB; Hora, MT				Chin, Mun Yuk; Cohen, Chelsea A. Blackburn; Hora, Matthew T.			Examining US business undergraduates' use of career information sources during career exploration	EDUCATION AND TRAINING			English	Article						Career development; External influences; Business school; Campus career services; Academic departments	COLLEGE-STUDENTS; SATISFACTION; SUPPORT	Purpose Campus career services are increasingly scrutinized as the primary career development resource for undergraduates. The purpose of this paper is to use Career Construction Theory to examine all sources of career information used by undergraduate business students and their contributions toward career exploration and development. Design/methodology/approach Using a mixed-methods design, a survey was first administered to 372 university students enrolled in an undergraduate business school in the USA. Focus group interviews were conducted with 35 students from the survey sample. Descriptive statistics are reported, and inductive themes and causal networks were derived from qualitative data. Findings In order of prominence, students endorsed using sociocultural (e.g. family) and institutional (e.g. career services center) resources, and exploratory activities (e.g. work experience) as career information sources. These sources contributed toward students' vocational development by enhancing their psychological readiness for work, building social capital and facilitating decisions. Research limitations/implications - Participants were sampled from one undergraduate business school in the USA and were self-selected into the study. Practical implications - Career services and higher education professionals should think of the career-related information sources available to students as a complex ecosystem of advice instead of singular resources that exist in isolation. Professionals should also attend to students existing sources of career information and consider ways to support students' development of social and professional networks and opportunities. Furthermore, universities should consider the potential for integrating career exploration into course curricula as opposed to tasking career services offices to be fully responsible for students' career-related outcomes. Originality/value This study is the first to examine undergraduate business students' sources of career information and their contributions to career development. Its insights offer evidence for ways to tailor interventions to support students' use of available information sources beyond campus career services.

The reflected light intensity, which carried the sample internal characteristic information, was measured the total nitrogen and organic matter content indirectly. The structure of the paper is as follows: First of all, designed the system hardware part with the Czerny-Terner grating splitting optical path. The apparatus hardware consisted of mainly light path and electrocircuit. The light path included light source, spectral element and photoelectric conversion element. The electrocircuit part included amplifies, filters and A/D converts. The diffuse light was converted to electrical signal by the photoelectric conversion element, and then the digital signal was displayed, stored. Secondly, using the partial least square method to establish soil component content near infrared application model. Finally, the performance of the apparatus was verified with soil samples test. The experimental results showed that: near infrared reflectance and the soil total nitrogen and organic matter content had significant correlation, the determination coefficient, which was obtained by the partial least squares of the total nitrogen and organic matter, was 91.84% and 81.06%. Thought the experiments proved that the apparatus can basic meets for soil component content detection requirements in agricultural production.

Although scientists thinking across levels find it easy to explain physiological phenomena, students often perceive this as a challenge. We developed a new graphic organiser called Zoom Map, which is a mode for structuring biological information along the levels of biological organisation and is designed to guide biology students when they need to consider the levels of organisation. The aim of this study is to examine how Zoom Map helps students explain a common phenomenon in plant physiology: leaves that are upright or wilted. Accordingly, we designed a teaching experiment covering 13 students. During the experiments, the students were videotaped. We used qualitative content analysis to examine the explanations. Our findings indicate that Zoom Map improved students' explanations of the phenomenon across multiple levels of organisation: The students used more levels than before, and they referred to lower levels that were lacking previously. Therefore, it can be concluded that students who use Zoom Map are supported in their ability to explain a biological phenomenon across the levels of biological organisation.

The state of Ohio developed an ADI associated with infant mortality: Ohio Opportunity Index (OOI). However, a powerful tool to present this information effectively to stakeholders was needed. Objectives We present a real use-case by documenting the design, development, deployment, and training processes associated with a dashboard solution visualizing ADI data. Methods The Opportunity Index Dashboard (OID) allows for interactive exploration of the OOI and its seven domains-transportation, education, employment, housing, health, access to services, and crime. We used a user-centered design approach involving feedback sessions with stakeholders, who included representatives from project sponsors and subject matter experts. We assessed the usability of the OID based on the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction dimensions. The process of designing, developing, deploying, and training users in regard to the OID is described. Results We report feedback provided by stakeholders for the OID categorized by function, content, and aesthetics. The OID has multiple, interactive components: choropleth map displaying OOI scores for a specific census tract, graphs presenting OOI or domain scores between tracts to compare relative positions for tracts, and a sortable table to visualize scores for specific county and census tracts. Changes based on parameter and filter selections are described using a general use-case. In the usability evaluation, the median task completion success rate was 83% and the median system usability score was 68. Conclusion The OID could assist health care leaders in making decisions that enhance care delivery and policy decision making regarding infant mortality. The dashboard helps communicate deprivation data across domains in a clear and concise manner. Our experience building this dashboard presents a template for developing dashboards that can address other health priorities.

J	Gillies, RM				Gillies, Robyn M.			Dialogic interactions in the cooperative classroom	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Dialogic talk; Dialogic teaching; Cooperation; Inquiry-based science	DISCOURSE; INQUIRY; TALK	Attention in recent years has turned to the key role talk plays in mediating students' learning when they work cooperatively together. There is no doubt that talk, albeit by the teacher or peers, has the capacity to stimulate and extend students' thinking and advance their learning. Teachers do this when they encourage students to engage in reciprocal dialogues where they exchange information, explore issues, interrogate ideas, and tackle problems in a cooperative environment that is supportive of these discussions. In turn, students learn to listen to what others have to say, consider alternative perspectives, and engage critically and constructively with each other's ideas by learning how to reason and justify their assertions as they cooperate together. This study involved three Year 7 teachers and 17 groups of students (3-5 students per group) from their classes. The teachers had agreed to teach two units of cooperative, inquiry-based science across two school terms. All three teachers had been trained to use a dialogic approach to teaching designed to challenge children's thinking and learning. This paper presents examples of both teachers' and students' dialogic interactions and discusses the complementarity of these discourses even though the teachers used slightly different dialogic approaches in interacting with their students.

As information seeking progresses, it is expected feelings of uncertainty surrounding, for example, the information need, what information will be useful to satisfy the need and how well the need has been satisfied will shift towards confidence and clarity. The six corollaries offered by Kuhlthau outline and explain areas where this shift can happen. However, does it happen for all groups of information-seekers? Undergraduate students with dyslexia often have lower information seeking-related self-efficacy than their peers and this can result in uncertainty persisting throughout information seeking. Method. Retrospective naturalistic think aloud observations were held with 20 undergraduate students with dyslexia. After looking for information for one of their (self-chosen) assignments, participants were invited to explore their thoughts, feelings and actions with the researcher while watching a screen recording of their information seeking session. Analysis. First, an inductive reflexive Thematic Analysis was conducted which revealed self-efficacy to be a key influence in the information seeking behaviour of undergraduate students with dyslexia. To investigate this further, a dedicated deductive analysis was conducted leveraging Kuhlthau's six corollaries. Results. The expected shift away from uncertainty towards clarity and confidence was found to be either delayed, disrupted or prevented by participants' low self-efficacy surrounding selecting and spelling keywords and reading, interpreting and evaluating information online. Uncertainty persisted throughout information seeking and was rarely reduced or resolved. Conclusions. Key areas for additional support during information seeking for this user group are identified, including keyword selection and spelling, accurate reading and interpretation and confident evaluation of online information.

Here, we report a surprising finding of 3 narrowband gamma rhythms in V1 that processed distinct spatial frequency (SF) signals and had different neural origins. The low gamma (LG; 25 to 40 Hz) rhythm was generated at the V1 superficial layer and preferred a higher SF compared with spike activity, whereas both the medium gamma (MG; 40 to 65 Hz), generated at the cortical level, and the high gamma HG; (65 to 85 Hz), originated precortically, preferred lower SF information. Furthermore, compared with the rates of spike activity, the powers of the 3 gammas had better performance in discriminating the edge and surface of simple objects. These findings suggest that gamma rhythms reflect the neural dynamics of neural circuitries that process different SF information in the visual system, which may be crucial for multiplexing SF information and synchronizing different features of an object.

Design considerations of a randomized controlled trial of sedation level during hip fracture repair surgery: a strategy to reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients	CLINICAL TRIALS			English	Article						Sedation; hip fracture repair; delirium; propofol; design considerations	RATING-SCALE; RISK; MELATONIN	Background Delirium is an acute change in mental status characterized by sudden onset, fluctuating course, inattention, disorganized thinking, and abnormal level of consciousness. The objective of the randomized controlled trial A STrategy to Reduce the Incidence of Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients (STRIDE) is to assess the effectiveness of light versus heavy sedation on delirium and other outcomes in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture repair surgery. Our goal is to describe the design considerations and lessons learned in planning and implementing the STRIDE trial. Methods Discussed are challenges encountered including (1) how to ensure that we quickly identify, assess the eligibility of, and randomize traumatic hip fracture patients; (2) how to implement interventions that involve continuous monitoring and adjustment during the surgery; and (3) how to measure and ascertain the primary outcome, delirium. Results To address the first challenge, we monitored the operating room schedule more actively than anticipated. We constructed and organized eligibility assessment data collection forms by purpose and by source of information needed to complete them. We decided that randomization needs to take place in the operating room. To address the second challenge, we designed and implemented a treatment protocol and covered the bispectral index monitor to prevent the Anesthesiologist/Anesthetist from being influenced by the bispectral index reading while administering the intervention. Finally, clinical assessment of delirium consisted of standardized interviews of the patient using validated instruments, interviews of those caring for the patient, and review of the medical record. A consensus panel made the final determination of a delirium diagnosis. We note that STRIDE is a single-center trial. The decisions we took may have different implications for multi-center trials. Conclusions Lessons learned are likely to provide useful information to others designing trials in emergency and surgical setting and for those who are interested in unbiased assessment of delirium.

J	Fonseca, F; Martin, J				Fonseca, Frederico; Martin, James			Learning the differences between ontologies and conceptual schemas through ontology-driven information systems.	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						ontologies; conceptual schemas; modeling	MODEL	In the traditional systems modeling approach, the modeler is required to capture a user's view of some domain in a formal conceptual schema. The designer's conceptualization may or may not match with the user's conceptualization. One of the reasons for these conflicts is the lack of an initial agreement among users and modelers concerning the concepts belonging to the domain. Such an agreement could be facilitated by means of an ontology. If the ontology is previously constructed and formalized so that it can be shared by the modeler and the user in the development process, such conflicts would be less likely to happen. Following up on that, a number of investigators have suggested that those working on information systems should make use of commonly held, formally defined ontologies that would constrain and direct the design, development, and use of information systems - thus avoiding the above mentioned difficulties. Whether ontologies represent a significant advance from the more traditional conceptual schemas has been challenged by some researchers. We review and summarize some major themes of this complex discussion. While recognizing the commonalities and historical continuities between conceptual schemas and ontologies, we think that there is an important emerging distinction that should not be obscured and should guide future developments. In particular, we propose that the notions of conceptual schemas and ontologies be distinguished so as to play essentially different roles for the developers and users of information systems. We first suggest that ontologies and conceptual schemas belong to two different epistemic levels. They have different objects and are created with different objectives. Our proposal is that ontologies should deal with general assumptions concerning the explanatory invariants of a domain - those that provide a framework enabling understanding and explanation of data across all domains inviting explanation and understanding. Conceptual schemas, on the other hand, should address the relation between such general explanatory categories and the facts that exemplify them in a particular domain (e.g., the contents of the database). In contrast to ontologies, conceptual schemas would involve specification of the meaning of the explanatory categories for a particular domain as well as the consequent dimensions of possible variation among the relevant data of a given domain. Accordingly, the conceptual schema makes possible both the intelligibility and the measurement of those facts of a particular domain. The proposed distinction between ontologies and conceptual schemas makes possible a natural decomposition of information systems in terms of two necessary but complementary epistemic functions: identification of an invariant background and measurement of the object along dimensions of possible variation. Recognition of the suggested distinction represents, we think, a natural evolution in the field of modeling, and significant principled guidance for developers and users of information systems.

J	Okoli, J; Watt, J				Okoli, Justin; Watt, John			Crisis decision-making: the overlap between intuitive and analytical strategies	MANAGEMENT DECISION			English	Article						Decision making; Information processing; Intuition; Crisis management; Experts; Intuitive judgement	UNCONSCIOUS THOUGHT; EXPERTISE; CHOICE; TRUST; 1ST	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to draw on the naturalistic decision making and cognitive science literature to examine how experienced crisis managers utilize the intuitive and analytical strategies when managing complex incidents. A cognitive model that describes the interplay between strategies is presented and discussed, and the specific role that intuition plays in analytical decision making is addressed. Design/methodology/approach - Designed as a conceptual paper, the extant literature is reviewed to advance discussions on the theme of intuitive and analytical decision making in the naturalistic environment. A new model of expert intuition - the information filtering and intuitive decision model - is presented and evaluated against existing cognitive models from the wider literature. Findings - The paper suggests that experts' ability to make intuitive decisions is strongly hinged on their information processing skills that allow irrelevant cues to be sifted out while the relevant cues are retained. The paper further revealed that experts generally employ the intuitive mode as their default strategy, drawing on the analytical mode only as conditions warrant. Originality/value - Prior research has shown that experts often make important task decisions using intuitive or analytical strategies or by combining both, but the sequence these should typically follow is still unresolved. Findings from the intuition model reveal that although intuition often precedes analytical thinking in almost all cases, both strategies exist to offer significant values to decision makers if the basis of their application is well understood.

A prototype mobile application for triaging dental emergencies	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Technology; software; emergencies; communication; public health and community dentistry; informatics; access to care; patient relations; computers; electronic data exchange	THINK-ALOUD PROTOCOLS; USABILITY; COMMUNICATION; SMARTPHONES; MANAGEMENT; PHYSICIANS; MEDICINE; VISITS	Background. Evidence suggests that dental emergencies are likely to occur when preferred care is less accessible. Communication barriers often exist that cause patients to receive suboptimal treatment or experience discomfort for extended lengths of time. Furthermore, limitations in the conventional approach for managing dental emergencies prevent dentists from receiving critical information before patient visits. Methods. The authors developed a mobile application to mediate the uncertainty of dental emergencies. The development and study consisted of a needs analysis and quality assessment of intraoral images captured by smartphones, prototype development, refining the prototype through usability inspection methods, and formative evaluation through usability testing with prospective users. Results. The developed application successfully guided all users through a series of questions designed to capture clinically meaningful data by using familiar smartphone functions. All participants were able to complete a report within 4 minutes, and all clinical information was comprehended by the users. Conclusions. Patient-provided information accompanied by high-resolution images may help dentists substantially in predicting urgency or preparing necessary treatment resources. The results illustrate the feasibility of patients using smartphone applications to report dental emergencies. This technology allows dentists to assess care remotely when direct patient contact is less practical. Practical Implications. This study's results demonstrate that patients can use mobile applications to transmit clinical data to their dentists and suggest the possibility of expanding the use of mobile applications to enhance access to routine and emergency dental care. The authors addressed how to enable patients to communicate emergency needs directly to a dentist while obviating patient emergency department visits.

Recently, much effort has been made to study the feasibility of providing consumers with a real sense of fabric through a virtual experience. The current paper proposes to extract fabric hand information from the perspective of visual perception. Two sensory experiments are conducted according to the standardized sensory evaluation procedures on a set of representative textile fabrics by two trained panels. The first experiment is aimed to measure how much fabric hand can be perceived through fabrics' visual displays. On the basis of the positive results obtained, the second experiment is carried out to further investigate the interactive mechanism between samples' visual features and their tactile properties. A novel algorithm based on rough set theory and fuzzy set theory is proposed in order to quantitatively measure relations between different sensory information.

As the Internet and educational technologies have evolved, however, educators indicate that online education and the related technology is more than just a technical consideration; thus, online educators and scholars should address the pedagogical perspectives of online learning. Therefore, this study attempts to provide an effective online teaching method and to investigate the effects of online competency-based learning (CBL) and design-based learning (DBL) on enhancing students' learning performance, self-directed learning readiness (SDLR), and experience of online learning in an online computing course. The experimental design in this study involved a 2 (CBL vs. non-CBL) x 2 (DBL vs. non-DBL) factorial pretest/posttest design. Four classes in a course titled "Applied Information Technology: Office Software" were chosen for this research. Students involved in this experiment were from non-computer field departments at a comprehensive university. Based on the analysis carried out in this research, students who received the intervention with online DBL showed significantly better skills in using PowerPoint. However, learners who received the intervention with online CBL and/or DBL did not have significantly better SDLR or experience of online learning. The potential reasons for this insignificance in students' SDLR and experience of online learning as well as their implications are reported in this paper.

Designing Scenarios for In-Organization Training Using the CyberCIEGE Game	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						CyberCEIGE; cyber security awareness; training programs; serious games; security threats	SECURITY AWARENESS; SERIOUS GAMES	Cyber security awareness training needs to be personalized to address the policies and requirements of a particular organization, although many of the concepts in this training practice are universal. The main reason for the failure of training programs is that the users do not think about applying security concepts. Therefore, the study aims to design scenarios for in-organization training using CyberCEIGE. In this context, CyberCIEGE is considered a flexible and highly interactive video game that is a security awareness tool. It is responsible for supporting organizational training objectives in an engaging security adventure in the presence of typical users. This game has shown success in utilizing information assurance education. The present study indicates that CyberCIEGE is effective in basic information awareness training programs for security purposes, such as the balance between corporate convenience and individual privacy.

The emphasis in course design is now on promoting key understandings, core competencies, and an understanding of connections between different fields. In biochemistry teaching, this radical shift from the content-based tradition is being driven by the "omics" information explosion; we can no longer teach all the information we have available. Biochemistry is a core, enabling discipline for much of modern scientific research, and biochemistry teaching is in urgent need of a method for delivery of conceptual frameworks. In this project, we aimed to define the key concepts in biochemistry. We find that the key concepts we defined map well onto the core science concepts recommended by the Vision and Change project. We developed a new method to present biochemistry through the lenses of these concepts. This new method challenged the way we thought about biochemistry as teachers. It also stimulated the majority of the students to think more deeply about biochemistry and to make links between biochemistry and material in other courses. This method is applicable to the full spectrum of content usually taught in biochemistry.	[Rowland, Susan L.; Smith, Christopher A.; Gillam, Elizabeth M.

To regulate PPIs has been thought to be challenging due to their highly dynamic and expansive interfacial areas. Nonetheless, successful examples have been reported of targeting PPIs using small molecules, peptides, and proteins. Peptides, especially macrocyclic peptides have proven to be a particularly useful tool to inhibit PPIs for their exquisite potency, stability and selectivity. Herein we review the recent developments of this area of research, focusing on the macrocyclic peptides isolated from natural products, identified from library screening, and rationally designed based on structures, as PPI regulators.

Design of a Three-Dimensional Cognitive Mapping Approach to Support Inquiry Learning	EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY			English	Article						Inquiry learning; Reasoning; External representation; Cognitive mapping; Science education	ORDER THINKING SKILLS; REPRESENTATIONAL GUIDANCE; KNOWLEDGE-CONSTRUCTION; SCIENCE; STUDENTS; ARGUMENTATION; ACHIEVEMENT; PERFORMANCE; ENGAGEMENT; DISCOVERY	The use of external representations has the potential to facilitate inquiry learning, especially hypothesis generation and reasoning, which typically present difficulties for students. This study describes a novel three-dimensional cognitive mapping (3DCM) approach that supports inquiry learning by allowing learners to combine the information on a problem, the subject knowledge, and the hypothesizing and reasoning process involved in the exploration in a single image. The study also investigates the influences of the 3DCM approach on knowledge achievement and learner perceptions within an online inquiry-learning context. Forty-eight 11 th-grade students used 3DCM to complete an inquiry task. Data were collected from multiple sources, including pre- and post-tests, questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews. The results revealed that the students showed high levels of academic achievement, positive attitudes toward inquiry learning, low levels of anxiety, and medium levels of confidence. A post-hoc test indicated that the students at a low academic level had acquired significantly more knowledge than either the high-level or medium- level students, thus narrowing the academic gap between low-level, medium-level, and high-level students. In addition, the participants' attitudes and degree of confidence were found to be positively related to their inquiry skills, such as hypothesis generation and reasoning. The implications of the study and directions for future work are also discussed.

Two discourse features have been found to impact on the effectiveness of argumentative discourse activities: Critically questioning and elaborating on the partner's information. The present study investigated how these functional communication activities can be supported in argumentative discourses on scientific information. In a 1 x 2 between-subjects design, we established either a difference or a similarity focus by instructing dyads to pay attention to either differences or similarities in views and arguments while discussing the topic. Results showed that focusing on differences had beneficial effects on the quality of argumentative discourse as well as on individual critical thinking. However, on a socio-motivational level, participants' intrinsic motivation regarding the cooperation with the discourse partner and working on the tasks was higher when focusing on similarities. Implications for improving argumentative discourse and thereby fostering individuals' critical thinking skills are discussed.

Utilisation of edutainment aids as augmented packages with selected collaborative instructional techniques in high schools	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Early Access						Edutainment packages; Think pair share; Reciprocal pair tutoring; Think aloud pair problem solving technique		The educational communities have come of age to reinvigorate instructional techniques, approaches and packages through augmentation of the existing traditional methods. The development of such new pedagogical and andragogical methods have recently paved way for the inclusion and use of technologies in education. In an attempt to establish appropriateness and applicability for use, this study focused on edutainment aids as augmented packages with selected collaborative instructional techniques in high schools. Two research objectives were formulated to guide the study, alongside two corresponding research questions and hypotheses. The study adopted quasi-experimental design using pretest, posttest with three treatment groups. Intact classes from three purposely selected schools were used as participants for the study. The instruments were subjected to field trial validation. Also, a pilot test was carried out and the result obtained yielded 0.78 reliability coefficient. All treatment groups were pretested to determine their cognitive load; posttest1 was administered at time 1 after four weeks of the treatment while posttest2 was administered at time 2, at an interval of two weeks. Mean and Standard deviation were used to answer the research questions while Analysis of Variance was used to test the hypotheses; Sidak Posthoc was also used to determine the area of difference. The findings from the study revealed that the use of edutainment instructional package augmented with Think-Pair Share, Reciprocal Pair Tutoring and Think Aloud Pair Problem Solving for teaching and learning has major impacts on students' performance and retention in high schools. Results showed that, Reciprocal Pair Tutoring, augmented with edutainment aids is most effective in facilitating learning outcome relative to Think Pair Share and Think Aloud Pair Problem Solving; however, content retention is most achieved through Think Pair Share, augmented with edutainment aids, relative to Think Aloud Pair Problem Solving and Reciprocal Pair Tutoring.

With the primary goal of improving students' critical thinking skills, the PCP was directed more toward an understanding of managing care than the business aspects of managed care and emphasized written communication skills, clinical hypothesis testing; and exploring ways to solve medical and ethical questions. Methods: All 239 students graduating in 2000 and 2001 were required to analyze the medical care received by one of their hospitalized patients. Using a criterion-based evaluation tool, students' written critiques were assessed in five specific areas, all of which required critical thinking skills. Students also received an overall grade for the project. The UME-21 Graduation Survey was used to assess changes in attitudes and behavior Students graduating in 1999, prior to the institution of the PCP graduation requirement, served as a control group. Results: The most frequently discussed topic of the PCPs was 14 cardiovascular disease. The mean overall rating by the faculty for the PCPs was 3.7 and 3.8 in academic years 2000 and 2001, respectively (maximum=5). In a qualitative analysis of the PCPs, students demonstrated insight into their patients' overall medical care, including the use of evidence-based medicine (EBM), quality improvement, and cost containment. There were no statistically significant differences, however, between the PCP and control groups on the UME-21 Graduation Survey. Nonetheless, more students who had completed the PCP reported that they had identified the total cost of a patient's stay, designed a quality improvement loop, and obtained clinical evidence from an EBM computer database. On this same survey, all students agreed with the use of clinical practice guidelines and cost containment. Conclusions: The PCP appeared to be relevant to the students' learning needs, and they provided cogent critiques of the medical care they had rendered as well as critical analyses of their patients' discharge summaries and the cost of care including ways to reduce cost. On the other hand, we were unable to demonstrate any substantial differences in the results of the UME-21 Graduation Survey given to both the PCP and control groups. In spite of this lack of effect on students' attitudes, the PCP was perceived by the faculty to be valuable and has been incorporated into the required third-year family medicine clerkship at the University of Nebraska.

From aggregation to interpretation: how assessors judge complex data in a competency-based portfolio	ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION			English	Article						Assessment; Competency-based medical education; Information processing; Portfolio; Rater cognition; Think-aloud method; Undergraduate medical education	FEEDBACK; COGNITION; ROLES	While portfolios are increasingly used to assess competence, the validity of such portfolio-based assessments has hitherto remained unconfirmed. The purpose of the present research is therefore to further our understanding of how assessors form judgments when interpreting the complex data included in a competency-based portfolio. Eighteen assessors appraised one of three competency-based mock portfolios while thinking aloud, before taking part in semi-structured interviews. A thematic analysis of the think-aloud protocols and interviews revealed that assessors reached judgments through a 3-phase cyclical cognitive process of acquiring, organizing, and integrating evidence. Upon conclusion of the first cycle, assessors reviewed the remaining portfolio evidence to look for confirming or disconfirming evidence. Assessors were inclined to stick to their initial judgments even when confronted with seemingly disconfirming evidence. Although assessors reached similar final (pass-fail) judgments of students' professional competence, they differed in their information-processing approaches and the reasoning behind their judgments. Differences sprung from assessors' divergent assessment beliefs, performance theories, and inferences about the student. Assessment beliefs refer to assessors' opinions about what kind of evidence gives the most valuable and trustworthy information about the student's competence, whereas assessors' performance theories concern their conceptualizations of what constitutes professional competence and competent performance. Even when using the same pieces of information, assessors furthermore differed with respect to inferences about the student as a person as well as a (future) professional. Our findings support the notion that assessors' reasoning in judgment and decision-making varies and is guided by their mental models of performance assessment, potentially impacting feedback and the credibility of decisions. Our findings also lend further credence to the assertion that portfolios should be judged by multiple assessors who should, moreover, thoroughly substantiate their judgments. Finally, it is suggested that portfolios be designed in such a way that they facilitate the selection of and navigation through the portfolio evidence.	[Pool, Andrea Oudkerk; Govaerts, Marjan J.

J	Lu, HY; Yi, L; Zhang, H				Lu, Haoyang; Yi, Li; Zhang, Hang			Autistic traits influence the strategic diversity of information sampling: Insights from two-stage decision models	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							SPECTRUM QUOTIENT AQ; DISORDER SHOW; ADULTS; INFERENCE; SELECTION; BIAS; POPULATION; ADAPTATION; VOLATILITY; PREDICTION	Information sampling can reduce uncertainty in future decisions but is often costly. To maximize reward, people need to balance sampling cost and information gain. Here we aimed to understand how autistic traits influence the optimality of information sampling and to identify the particularly affected cognitive processes. Healthy human adults with different levels of autistic traits performed a probabilistic inference task, where they could sequentially sample information to increase their likelihood of correct inference and may choose to stop at any moment. We manipulated the cost and evidence associated with each sample and compared participants' performance to strategies that maximize expected gain. We found that participants were overall close to optimal but also showed autistic-trait-related differences. Participants with higher autistic traits had a higher efficiency of winning rewards when the sampling cost was zero but a lower efficiency when the cost was high and the evidence was more ambiguous. Computational modeling of participants' sampling choices and decision times revealed a two-stage decision process, with the second stage being an optional second thought. Participants may consider cost in the first stage and evidence in the second stage, or in the reverse order. The probability of choosing to stop sampling at a specific stage increases with increasing cost or increasing evidence. Surprisingly, autistic traits did not influence the decision in either stage. However, participants with higher autistic traits inclined to consider cost first, while those with lower autistic traits considered cost or evidence first in a more balanced way. This would lead to the observed autistic-trait-related advantages or disadvantages in sampling optimality, depending on whether the optimal sampling strategy is determined only by cost or jointly by cost and evidence. Author summary Children with autism can spend hours practicing lining up toys or learning all about cars or lighthouses. This kind of behaviors, we think, may reflect suboptimal information sampling strategies, that is, a failure to balance the gain of information with the cost (time, energy, or money) of information sampling. We hypothesized that suboptimal information sampling is a general characteristic of people with autism or high level of autistic traits. In our experiment, we tested how participants may adjust their sampling strategies with the change of sampling cost and information gain in the environment. Though all participants were healthy young adults who had similar IQs, higher autistic traits were associated with higher or lower efficiency of winning rewards under different conditions. Counterintuitively, participants with different levels of autistic traits did not differ in the general tendency of oversampling or undersampling, or in the decision they would reach when a specific set of sampling cost or information gain was considered. Instead, participants with higher autistic traits consistently considered sampling cost first and only weighed information gain during a second thought, while those with lower autistic traits had more diverse sampling strategies that consequently better balanced sampling cost and information gain.

However, these tools are often seen as closed and intransparent for human decision-makers. An essential requirement for their success is the ability to provide explanations about themselves that are understandable and meaningful to the users. While explanations generally have positive connotations, studies showed that the assumption behind users interacting and engaging with these explanations could introduce trust calibration errors such as facilitating irrational or less thoughtful agreement or disagreement with the AI recommendation. In this paper, we explore how to help trust calibration through explanation interaction design. Our research method included two main phases. We first conducted a think-aloud study with 16 participants aiming to reveal main trust calibration errors concerning explainability in AI-Human collaborative decision-making tools. Then, we conducted two co-design sessions with eight participants to identify design principles and techniques for explanations that help trust calibration. As a conclusion of our research, we provide five design principles: Design for engagement, challenging habitual actions, attention guidance, friction and support training and learning. Our findings are meant to pave the way towards a more integrated framework for designing explanations with trust calibration as a primary goal.

Useful or meaningful information is extracted from these data often through statistical learning or model fitting. In massive datasets, both sample size and number of predictors can be large, in which case conventional methods face computational challenges. Recently, an innovative and effective sampling scheme based on leverage scores via singular value decompositions has been proposed to select rows of a design matrix as a surrogate of the full data in linear regression. Analogously, variable screening can be viewed as selecting rows of the design matrix. However, effective variable selection along this line of thinking remains elusive. In this article, we bridge this gap to propose a weighted leverage variable screening method by using both the left and right singular vectors of the design matrix. We show theoretically and empirically that the predictors selected using our method can consistently include true predictors not only for linear models but also for complicated general index models. Extensive simulation studies show that the weighted leverage screening method is highly computationally efficient and effective. We also demonstrate its success in identifying carcinoma related genes using spatial transcriptome data.

Attenuated interoceptive processing in individuals with major depressive disorder and high repetitive negative thinking	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; STRESS-DISORDER; SYMPTOMS; ANXIETY; INSULA; BODY; STIMULATION; RUMINATION; REMISSION; AWARENESS	Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a transdiagnostic symptom associated with poor outcomes in major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD is characterized by altered interoception, which has also been associated with poor outcomes. The present study investigated whether RNT is directly associated with altered interoceptive processing. Interoceptive awareness toward the heart and stomach was probed on the Visceral Interoceptive Attention (VIA) task with fMRI in MDD individuals who were propensity-matched on the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms and relevant demographics but different in RNT intensity (High RNT [H-RNT, n = 48] & Low RNT [L-RNT, n = 49]), and in matched healthy volunteers (HC, n = 27). Both H-RNT and L-RNT MDD individuals revealed reduced stomach interoceptive processing compared to HC in the left medial frontal region and insular cortex (H-RNT: 8 =-1.04, L-RNT: 8 =-0.97), perirhinal cortex (H-RNT: 8 =-0.99, L-RNT: =-1.03), and caudate nucleus (H-RNT: 8 =-1.06, L-RNT: 8 =-0.89). However, H-RNT was associated with decreased right medial temporal lobe activity including the hippocampus and amygdala during stomach interoceptive trials (8 =-0.61) compared to L-RNT. Insular interoceptive processing was similar in H-RNT and L-RNT participants (8 =-0.07, p = 0.92). MDD individuals with high RNT exhibited altered gastric interoceptive responses in brain areas that are important for associating the information with specific contexts and emotions. Attenuated interoceptive processing may contribute to RNT generation, non-adaptive information processing, action selection, and thus poor treatment outcome.

One school stresses on the popular software development methodologies, but horror stories on poorly designed systems are not uncommon. The other school advocates formal methods, but most practitioners regard them as impractical. We recommend that we should bridge the gap between the formal and informal by bringing theory to existing practice. The formalism should be used as a working tool behind popular software development methodologies. Students should not be trained as craftsmen who consider software development as an art and learn only from past mistakes. Nor should they be trained as mathematicians who are more comfortable with theory than applications. Software engineers must be educated as real ''engineers'' who are competent with industrial practices as well as the mathematical foundation directly supporting them.

The digital transformation, one of the main building blocks of the Smart City movement, is calling for a workforce prepared to develop novel business processes. Problem-solving, critical and analytical thinking are now the essential skills being looked at by employees. The development of the so-called STEM curriculum, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics is being given a lot of attention by educational boards in response to preparing young generations for the Smart City work market. Based on the IMD Smart City Index, PISA, and World Bank reports, we develop a model for assessing the impact of the IT secondary school capacities on Smart-City business developments. The model reveals the relationship between the technological capacity of the secondary-school, and the business activity of a Smart City. Moreover, the study shows the existence of a positive relationship between the IT capacity of secondary schools and the resulting entrepreneurial activity of the city. Our results are of interest to decision-makers and stakeholders responsible for designing educational policies and agents involved in the digital transformation and development of Smart Cities initiatives.

J	Satoh, R; Oizumi, M; Kazama, H; Okada, M				Satoh, Ryota; Oizumi, Masafumi; Kazama, Hokto; Okada, Masato			Mechanisms of Maximum Information Preservation in the <i>Drosophila</i> Antennal Lobe	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OLFACTORY LOCAL INTERNEURONS; GAIN-CONTROL; MAP; NEURONS; REPRESENTATION; POPULATIONS; INHIBITION	We examined the presence of maximum information preservation, which may be a fundamental principle of information transmission in all sensory modalities, in the Drosophila antennal lobe using an experimentally grounded network model and physiological data. Recent studies have shown a nonlinear firing rate transformation between olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and second-order projection neurons (PNs). As a result, PNs can use their dynamic range more uniformly than ORNs in response to a diverse set of odors. Although this firing rate transformation is thought to assist the decoder in discriminating between odors, there are no comprehensive, quantitatively supported studies examining this notion. Therefore, we quantitatively investigated the efficiency of this firing rate transformation from the viewpoint of information preservation by computing the mutual information between odor stimuli and PN responses in our network model. In the Drosophila olfactory system, all ORNs and PNs are divided into unique functional processing units called glomeruli. The nonlinear transformation between ORNs and PNs is formed by intraglomerular transformation and interglomerular interaction through local neurons (LNs). By exploring possible nonlinear transformations produced by these two factors in our network model, we found that mutual information is maximized when a weak ORN input is preferentially amplified within a glomerulus and the net LN input to each glomerulus is inhibitory. It is noteworthy that this is the very combination observed experimentally. Furthermore, the shape of the resultant nonlinear transformation is similar to that observed experimentally.

J	Karabati, S; Sayin, S				Karabati, Selcuk; Sayin, Serpil			Single-supplier/multiple-buyer supply chain coordination: Incorporating buyers' expectations under vertical information sharing	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						supply chain coordination; inventory management; discount schemes	QUANTITY DISCOUNTS; INVENTORY SYSTEMS	We address the coordination problem in a single-supplier/multiple-buyer supply chain. The supplier wishes to coordinate the supply chain by offering quantity discounts. To obtain their complete cost information, the supplier exchanges his own cost parameters with buyers leading to vertical information sharing. The supplier thinks that the buyers, as they have access to supplier's setup and holding cost information, may demand a portion of the anticipated coordination savings based on the partial information they hold about the cost structure of the entire supply chain. We model each buyer's expectations based on her limited view of the entire supply chain which consists of herself and the supplier only. These expectations are then incorporated into the modeling of the supply chain, which results in a generalization of the traditional Stackelberg type models. We discuss alternative efficiency sharing mechanisms, and propose methods to design the associated discount schemes that take buyers' expectations into account. In designing the discount schemes, we consider both price discriminatory and non-price discriminatory approaches. The study adds to the existing body of work by incorporating buyers' expectations into a constrained Stackelberg structure, and by achieving coordination without forcing buyers to explicitly comply with the supplier's replenishment period in choosing their order quantities. The numerical analysis of the coordination efficiency and allocation of the net savings of the proposed discount schemes shows that the supplier is still able to coordinate the supply chain with high efficiency levels, and retain a significant portion of the net savings.

But what is it that is understood by climate change, and by whom? What frame of reference is drawn upon to communicate meaningfully about climate change? Do particular subgroups within our society hold different understandings, or have the debate and the prolific dissemination of information about this issue coalesced around a core perception or image of what climate change is? To answer these questions, we conceptualized climate change within the theory of social representations as emergent socially constructed knowledge. We analyzed word association data collected in Australia from persons identifying as having a scientific, government, or general public background (N = 3300). All respondents were asked to write the first words that came to mind when they thought about climate change. Comparative analyses of the word associations reveal that respondents from different backgrounds define climate change in different ways. The results suggest that there is a common core set of concepts shared by the different groups, but there are also a great many differences in how climate change is framed and conceived by respondents. The results are discussed in relation to what they imply for responses to climate change by these social groups and in relation to interventions designed to encourage climate adaptation.

Design: Development was guided by the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) and included a survey and think-aloud process.Study sampleA total of 153 participants completed a survey about what to include in the decision aid (111 adults with hearing loss, 21 family members of adults with hearing loss, and 21 professionals). Six adults with hearing loss and six family members participated in a think-aloud process to provide feedback as they used an initial version of the decision aid.ResultsIn the survey, 26 of the 38 potential items were identified as being highest priority and were included in the initial version of the decision aid. This initial version was then tested in the think-aloud sessions and a prototype of a web-based version was developed based on participant responses related to: 1) information on the decision aid, 2) ease of use, 3) layout and orders of the items, 4) satisfaction, 5) areas for improvement (e.g., need for graphics).ConclusionsThe methodologies used in this study are recommended for developing decision aids for adults with acquired hearing loss.

A randomised controlled Study Within A Trial (SWAT)	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							INFORMED-CONSENT; CLINICAL-TRIALS; VIDEO; PARTICIPATION; ANIMATION; PARENTS; PROGRAM	Objectives To evaluate digital, multimedia information (MMI) for its effects on trial recruitment, retention, decisions about participation and acceptability by patients, compared with printed information. Design Study Within A Trial using random cluster allocation within the Forearm Fracture Recovery in Children Evaluation (FORCE) study. Setting Emergency departments in 23 UK hospitals. Participants 1409 children aged 4-16 years attending with a torus (buckle) fracture, and their parents/guardian. Children's mean age was 9.2 years, 41.0% were female, 77.4% were ethnically White and 90.0% spoke English as a first language. Interventions Participants and their parents/guardian received trial information either via multimedia, including animated videos, talking head videos and text (revised for readability and age appropriateness when needed) on tablet computer (MMI group; n=681), or printed participant information sheet (PIS group; n=728). Outcome measures Primary outcome was recruitment rate to FORCE. Secondary outcomes were Decision-Making Questionnaire (nine Likert items, analysed summatively and individually), three 'free text' questions (deriving subjective evaluations) and trial retention. Results MMI produced a small, not statistically significant increase in recruitment: 475 (69.8%) participants were recruited from the MMI group; 484 (66.5%) from the PIS group (OR=1.35; 95% CI 0.76 to 2.40, p=0.31). A total of 324 (23.0%) questionnaires were returned and analysed. There was no difference in total Decision-Making Questionnaire scores: adjusted mean difference 0.05 (95% CI -1.23 to 1.32, p=0.94). The MMI group was more likely to report the information 'very easy' to understand (89; 57.8% vs 67; 39.4%; Z=2.60, p=0.01) and identify information that was explained well (96; 62.3% vs 71; 41.8%). Almost all FORCE recruits were retained at the 6 weeks' timepoint and there was no difference in retention rate between the information groups: MMI (473; 99.6%); PIS (481; 99.4%). Conclusions MMI did not increase recruitment or retention in the FORCE trial, but participants rated multimedia as easier to understand and were more likely to evaluate it positively.

Implications of resource limitations for a conscious machine	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Brain Inspired Cognitive Systems (BICS 2006)	OCT 10-14, 2006	Lesvos, GREECE			Consciousness; Information model; System resource architecture; System design	SIMULATION; BINDING; THOUGHT; FUTURE; COMMON	A machine with human-like consciousness would be an extremely complex system. Prior work has demonstrated that the way in which information handling resources are organized (the resource architecture) in an extremely complex learning system is constrained within some specific bounds if the available resources are limited, and that there is evidence that the human brain has been constrained in this way. An architectural concept is developed for a conscious machine that is within the architectural bounds imposed by resource limitations. This architectural concept includes a resource driven architecture, a description of how conscious phenomena would be supported by information processes within that architecture, and a description of actual implementations of the key information processes. Other approaches to designing a conscious machine are reviewed. The conclusion is reached that although they could be capable of supporting human consciousness-like phenomena, they do not take into account the architectural bounds imposed by resource limitations. Systems implemented using these approaches to learn a full range of cognitive features including human-like consciousness would therefore require more information handling resources, could have difficulty learning without severe interference with prior learning, and could require add-on subsystems to support some conscious phenomena that emerge naturally as consequences of a resource driven architecture.

The art and science of using quality control to understand and improve fMRI data	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fMRI; quality control; neuroimaging; reproducibility; resting state; GLM; noise removal	MULTICENTER FMRI; SIGNAL; ASSURANCE; MOTION	Designing and executing a good quality control (QC) process is vital to robust and reproducible science and is often taught through hands on training. As FMRI research trends toward studies with larger sample sizes and highly automated processing pipelines, the people who analyze data are often distinct from those who collect and preprocess the data. While there are good reasons for this trend, it also means that important information about how data were acquired, and their quality, may be missed by those working at later stages of these workflows. Similarly, an abundance of publicly available datasets, where people (not always correctly) assume others already validated data quality, makes it easier for trainees to advance in the field without learning how to identify problematic data. This manuscript is designed as an introduction for researchers who are already familiar with fMRI, but who did not get hands on QC training or who want to think more deeply about QC. This could be someone who has analyzed fMRI data but is planning to personally acquire data for the first time, or someone who regularly uses openly shared data and wants to learn how to better assess data quality. We describe why good QC processes are important, explain key priorities and steps for fMRI QC, and as part of the FMRI Open QC Project, we demonstrate some of these steps by using AFNI software and AFNI's QC reports on an openly shared dataset. A good QC process is context dependent and should address whether data have the potential to answer a scientific question, whether any variation in the data has the potential to skew or hide key results, and whether any problems can potentially be addressed through changes in acquisition or data processing. Automated metrics are essential and can often highlight a possible problem, but human interpretation at every stage of a study is vital for understanding causes and potential solutions.

However, misinformation still constitutes a major challenge due to the variety of misleading techniques and their continuous updates which call for the exercise of critical thinking to build resilience. In this study we present two open access chatbots, the Fake News Immunity Chatbot and the Vaccinating News Chatbot, which combine Fallacy Theory and Human-Computer Interaction to inoculate citizens and communication gatekeepers against misinformation. These chatbots differ from existing tools both in function and form. First, they target misinformation and enhance the identification of fallacious arguments; and second, they are multiagent and leverage discourse theories of persuasion in their conversational design. After having described both their backend and their frontend design, we report on the evaluation of the user interface and impact on users' critical thinking skills through a questionnaire, a crowdsourced survey, and a pilot qualitative experiment. The results shed light on the best practices to design user-friendly active inoculation tools and reveal that the two chatbots are perceived as increasing critical thinking skills in the current misinformation ecosystem.

For this purpose, the authors analyzed publications from the Scopus database.Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, the authors conducted bibliometric analysis based on two major techniques: performance analysis and science mapping. The authors applied VOSviewer and Biblioshiny to address the research questions of present study. The study explored the hot trend topics and summarized them with discussions and implications.Findings - Based on the analysis of 500 publications, the authors present an overview of performance and science mapping from the perspective of different aspects such as publication output and authors. Also, authors visualized the text mining by co-word analysis forming nine clusters as well as mapping trend topics. The existing publications were divided into ten clusters according to different keyword analyses: Leadership, Mental health, Technology, Crisis Management, Gender, Challenges, well-being and Work-life balance.Research limitations/implications - Sample from the Scopus database is not exhaustive, and the dataset may be skewed due to the adoption of the selection criteria. The authors' concentration was on academic publications in English that excludes potentially intriguing and pioneering studies done in other languages. The study area was limited to social science only.Practical implications - The paramount lesson is that the COVID-19 quandary is multifaceted, necessitating not simply adaptations to current strategies but also an understanding and analysis of advancements in the economy, commerce and society. According to the analysis presented above, to overcome the COVID-19 "black swan event ", managers must think ahead. The analysis gives leaders and decision-makers a range of useful information on work from home (WFH) difficulties in COVID-19, as well as initiatives and revisions that must be implemented at the economic, social and scientific aspects when dealing with such uncertainties. The findings also aid managers in forecasting the need for sophisticated technology, organizational agility and resilience to attain the desired direction of progress.Originality/value - With a focus on addressing WFH during COVID-19 from social science perspective and to synthesize its future research directions systematically, the authors performed Bibliometric analysis both with VOSviewer and Biblioshiny, in order to enhance the overall analysis for higher accuracy and more reliable results that is unique value addition and contribution to the existing literature.

J	Luo, YJ; Wei, W; Ying, Z				Luo Yunjiu; Wei Wei; Ying Zheng			Artificial Intelligence-Generated and Human Expert-Designed Vocabulary Tests: A Comparative Study	SAGE OPEN			English	Article						vocabulary test; artificial intelligence; construct validity; computerized test	KNOWLEDGE; INTEGRATION; INFORMATION; LEARNERS; CONTEXT; ABILITY	Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have the potential to reduce the workload for the second language (L2) teachers and test developers. We propose two AI distractor-generating methods for creating Chinese vocabulary items: semantic similarity and visual similarity. Semantic similarity refers to antonyms and synonyms, while visual similarity refers to the phenomenon that two phrases share one or more characters in common. This study explores the construct validity of the two types of selected-response vocabulary tests (AI-generated items and human expert-designed items) and compares their item difficulty and item discrimination. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Seventy-eight students from Beijing Language and Culture University were asked to respond to AI-generated and human expert-designed items respectively. Students' scores were analyzed using the two-parameter item response theory (2PL-IRT) model. Thirteen students were then invited to report their test taking strategies in the think-aloud section. The findings from the students' item responses revealed that the human expert-designed items were easier but had more discriminating power than the AI-generated items. The results of think-aloud data indicated that the AI-generated items and expert-designed items might assess different constructs, in which the former elicited test takers' bottom-up test-taking strategies while the latter seemed more likely to trigger test takers' rote memorization ability.

From expert-driven to user-oriented communication of infection control guidelines	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article						User-centered design; Usability; Infectious diseases	CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINES; STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; THINKING ALOUD; USABILITY; PERFORMANCE; PROTOCOLS; QUALITY	Currently, infection control guidelines in hospitals and other health care institutions are more expert-driven than user-oriented In order to enhance the usability of the expert-driven guideline format, we developed a website for the communication of existing guidelines that better fit the practical information needs of health care workers (HCWs) We employed a user-centered design process that involved two studies In the initial study. 28 HCWs were asked to solve tasks using existing, paper-based infection control guidelines In order to detect their strategies and problems. the participants were asked to think aloud Usability problems occurred due to poorly structured information, insufficient quality of information, and a mismatch between experts' and HCWs' vocabulary To overcome these shortcomings, three design principles were applied for communicating infection control guidelines better navigation (the guidelines should be searchable in several ways). multimodality (the guidelines should not be presented as text only), and action-orientation (the guidelines should be presented as HCWs' behaviors) A website was developed to meet these principles In the second study, the same 28 HCWs completed tasks identical to those of the first study while thinking aloud, but this time using the website The percentage of correctly completed tasks increased and the mean time for task completion decreased significantly Also, respondents were more satisfied with the website than the paper-based guidelines The number of problems due to poor information quality and a mismatch m vocabulary declined. although the number of structural problems increased This can probably be explained by the fact that the navigation structure was user-generated (using Card Sort), in contrast to a standardized answer format based on common usability principles Overall, we found that involving HCWs in the development process is important to create a sense of ownership and to foster the implementation of the guidelines, which might eventually result in compliance and reduce health care-associated infections This paper outlines concrete steps for how to involve HCWs in the design process (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved	[Verhoeven, Fenne; Steehouder, Michael F.; Van Gemert-Pijnen, Julia E.

Does the use of the Informed Healthcare Choices (IHC) primary school resources improve the ability of grade-5 children in Uganda to assess the trustworthiness of claims about the effects of treatments: protocol for a cluster-randomised trial	TRIALS			English	Article						Critical thinking; Critical appraisal; Higher-order thinking; Meta-cognition; Treatment claims; Health literacy; Evidence-based health care; EBM teaching resources; Primary school curriculum; Science teaching	KEY CONCEPTS; EDUCATION; LITERACY; INTERVENTIONS	Background: The ability to appraise claims about the benefits and harms of treatments is crucial for informed health care decision-making. This research aims to enable children in East African primary schools (the clusters) to acquire and retain skills that can help them make informed health care choices by improving their ability to obtain, process and understand health information. The trial will evaluate (at the individual participant level) whether specially designed learning resources can teach children some of the key concepts relevant to appraising claims about the benefits and harms of health care interventions (treatments). Methods: This is a two-arm, cluster-randomised trial with stratified random allocation. We will recruit 120 primary schools (the clusters) between April and May 2016 in the central region of Uganda. We will stratify participating schools by geographical setting (rural, semi-urban, or urban) and ownership (public or private). The Informed Healthcare Choices (IHC) primary school resources consist of a textbook and a teachers' guide. Each of the students in the intervention arm will receive a textbook and attend nine lessons delivered by their teachers during a school term, with each lesson lasting 80 min. The lessons cover 12 key concepts that are relevant to assessing claims about treatments and making informed health care choices. The second arm will carry on with the current primary school curriculum. We have designed the Claim Evaluation Tools to measure people's ability to apply key concepts related to assessing claims about the effects of treatments and making informed health care choices. The Claim Evaluation Tools use multiple choice questions addressing each of the 12 concepts covered by the IHC school resources. Using the Claim Evaluation Tools we will measure two primary outcomes: (1) the proportion of children who 'pass', based on an absolute standard and (2) their average scores. Discussion: As far as we are aware this is the first randomised trial to assess whether key concepts needed to judge claims about the effects of treatment can be taught to primary school children. Whatever the results, they will be relevant to learning how to promote critical thinking about treatment claims.

J	Groves, S; Brooks, J				Groves, Samantha; Brooks, Joanna			What do young women below national screening age in England think about cervical cancer and cervical screening? A qualitative study	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						cervical cancer; cervical screening; young women; health belief model; qualitative; email interviews; template analysis	HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINE; HEALTH BELIEF MODEL; 1ST INVITATION; BARRIERS; PARTICIPATION; EXPERIENCES; PREVENTION; ATTENDANCE; PROGRAM; IMPACT	Aims and objectives To explore what women aged below the national screening age in the UK know and think about cervical cancer and cervical screening. Background The efficacy of cervical cancer screening is well established. However, cervical screening attendance in the United Kingdom has decreased, with especially low rates at the first screening opportunity at age 25. Research has not yet explored knowledge and beliefs underpinning young women's intention to screen before first screening invitation. Design Qualitative exploratory study. Methods Qualitative email interviews were undertaken with 16 participants, using questions derived from the Health Belief Model. Data were analysed using template analysis. The COREQ were followed. Results Analysis generated three themes; (1) Learning about cervical cancer and cervical screening: sources of information and (missed) opportunities; (2) Young women know screening is important - but they don't always know why; (3) Screening intentions: a cost/benefit analysis of the available information. Conclusions Young women had varied knowledge and beliefs about cervical cancer and screening which were underpinned by several sources of information available to them. Most women expressed an intention to attend screening when invited; however, some participants were unsure, with low screening-based knowledge and low perceived susceptibility of cervical cancer identified as key barriers. Social media, familial interactions and interventions within education were highlighted as being suited to interventions aimed at increasing cervical cancer- and screening-based knowledge in young women. Relevance to clinical practice Findings suggest that women below screening age could be better informed about cervical cancer and screening. Tailored interventions addressing common concerns and misconceptions around screening may be acceptable to young women and could help to promote screening attendance at first invitation.

Thought disorders have been regarded as a consequence of the loosening of associations between semantic concepts since the term "schizophrenia" was first coined by Bleuler. However, a mechanistic account of this cardinal disturbance in terms of functional dysconnection has been lacking. To evaluate how aberrant semantic connections are expressed through brain activity, we characterized large-scale network structures of concept representations using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Study Design We quantified various concept representations in patients' brains from fMRI activity evoked by movie scenes using encoding modeling. We then constructed semantic brain networks by evaluating the similarity of these semantic representations and conducted graph theory-based network analyses. Study Results Neurotypical networks had small-world properties similar to those of natural languages, suggesting small-worldness as a universal property in semantic knowledge networks. Conversely, small-worldness was significantly reduced in networks of schizophrenia patients and was correlated with psychological measures of delusions. Patients' semantic networks were partitioned into more distinct categories and had more random within-category structures than those of controls. Conclusions The differences in conceptual representations manifest altered semantic clustering and associative intrusions that underlie thought disorders. This is the first study to provide pathophysiological evidence for the loosening of associations as reflected in randomization of semantic networks in schizophrenia. Our method provides a promising approach for understanding the neural basis of altered or creative inner experiences of individuals with mental illness or exceptional abilities, respectively.

Guide Development for eHealth Interventions Targeting People With a Low Socioeconomic Position: Participatory Design Approach	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						eHealth; guide; guidelines professionals; intervention development; intervention evaluation; low socioeconomic position; low socioeconomic status; risk groups; tailored care	BEHAVIOR-CHANGE; HEALTH-CARE; ASSOCIATION; DISPARITIES	Background: People with a low socioeconomic position (SEP) are less likely to benefit from eHealth interventions, exacerbating social health inequalities. Professionals developing eHealth interventions for this group face numerous challenges. A comprehensive guide to support these professionals in their work could mitigate these inequalities. Objective: We aimed to develop a web-based guide to support professionals in the development, adaptation, evaluation, and implementation of eHealth interventions for people with a low SEP. Methods: This study consisted of 2 phases. The first phase involved a secondary analysis of 2 previous qualitative and quantitative studies. In this phase, we synthesized insights from the previous studies to develop the guide's content and information structure. In the second phase, we used a participatory design process. This process included iterative development and evaluation of the guide's design with 11 professionals who had experience with both eHealth and the target group. We used test versions (prototypes) and think-aloud testing combined with semistructured interviews and a questionnaire to identify design requirements and develop and adapt the guide accordingly. Results: The secondary analysis resulted in a framework of recommendations for developing the guide, which was categorized under 5 themes: development, reach, adherence, evaluation, and implementation. The participatory design process resulted in 16 requirements on system, content, and service aspects for the design of the guide. For the system category, the guide was required to have an open navigation strategy leading to more specific information and short pages with visual elements. Content requirements included providing comprehensible information, scientific evidence, a user perspective, information on practical applications, and a personal and informal tone of voice. Service requirements involved improving suitability for different professionals, ensuring long-term viability, and a focus on implementation. Based on these requirements, we developed the final version of "the inclusive eHealth guide." Conclusions: The inclusive eHealth guide provides a practical, user-centric tool for professionals aiming to develop, adapt, evaluate, and implement eHealth interventions for people with a low SEP, with the aim of reducing health disparities in this population. Future research should investigate its suitability for different end-user goals, its external validity, its applicability in specific contexts, and its real-world impact on social health inequality.

Personalized Nutrition: Translating the Science of NutriGenomics Into Practice: Proceedings From the 2018 American College of Nutrition Meeting	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF NUTRITION			English	Article						Personalized nutrition; nutritional genomics; pharmacogenomics; single nucleotide polymorphism; next generation sequencing; gene-diet interactions; metabolic diseases; wellness and genomics; Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline; autoimmune diseases; overt inflammation and chronic diseases; gut microbiome	ONE-CARBON METABOLISM; BIOINFORMATICS CHALLENGES; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; RISK-FACTOR; LIFE-STYLE; DIET; ASSOCIATION; AUTOIMMUNE; GENETICS; DISEASE	Adverse reactions to foods and adverse drug reactions are inherent in product defects, medication errors, and differences in individual drug exposure. Pharmacogenetics is the study of genetic causes of individual variations in drug response and pharmacogenomics more broadly involves genome-wide analysis of the genetic determinants of drug efficacy and toxicity. The similarity of nutritional genomics and pharmacogenomics stems from the innate goal to identify genetic variants associated with metabolism and disease. Thus, nutrigenomics can be thought of as encompassing gene-diet interactions involving diverse compounds that are present in even the simplest foods. The advances in the knowledge base of the complex interactions among genotype, diet, lifestyle, and environment is the cornerstone that continues to elicit changes in current medical practice to ultimately yield personalized nutrition recommendations for health and risk assessment. This information could be used to understand how foods and dietary supplements uniquely affect the health of individuals and, hence, wellness. The individual's gut microbiota is not only paramount but pivotal in embracing the multiple-functional relationships with complex metabolic mechanisms involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis. The genetic revolution has ushered in an exciting era, one in which many new opportunities are expected for nutrition professionals with expertise in nutritional genomics. The American College of Nutrition's conference focused on "Personalized Nutrition: Translating the Science of NutriGenomics Into Practice" was designed to help to provide the education needed for the professional engagement of providers in the personalized medicine era.

Tinkering alone and together: Tracking the emergence of children's projects in a library workshop	LEARNING CULTURE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION			English	Article						Tinkering; constructionism; Learning; Collaborative learning	THINKING; SCIENCE	The Maker Movement has inspired educators, mentors, and parents to teach and learn with children through a wide range of activities called making. This article describes children's ways of problem solving while engaging in a special kind of making described as tinkering using a broad constructionist (Papert, 1983) theoretical perspective of learning as active meaning making while building constructions. We present three tinkering projects created by children along with the emergent problem-solving associated with each project. Each case is unique in terms of the tinkering and problem-solving process, nature of materials used, and the social interactions that support it. Our findings indicate how tinkering projects mediate the intersection of personal and public, physical and intellectual, and enable the navigation of material, social, and intellectual domains. These findings are situated in existing research in the area of problem solving while designing and tinkering, and implications for future learning are considered.

I think you can: transpersonal efficacy in teams	JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Teams; Virtual teams	ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR; COLLECTIVE-EFFICACY; TASK INTERDEPENDENCE; SELF-EFFICACY; RELATIONSHIP CONFLICT; PERFORMANCE; MOTIVATION; MEDIATION; BELIEFS; IMPACT	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to expand the nomological network of a relational efficacy construct, transpersonal efficacy, and examine its effect on attitudes and behaviors important for team performance. The authors identify several antecedents to transpersonal efficacy, including task interdependence, agreeableness and conscientiousness. The authors also find that transpersonal efficacy is related to relational attitudes and behaviors in teams. Design/methodology/approach This study consists of an online cross-sectional survey completed by participants representing a wide range of occupations, team types, contexts and industries. Participants reported on their working relationships with team members and various behavioral outcomes. Participants used the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) to describe their teammates' job requirements and to evaluate each teammate's ability to complete required tasks. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used to test hypotheses. Findings Findings suggest that people in highly interdependent teams have more confidence in their teammates. Further, transpersonal efficacy predicts relationship, task and process conflict when controlling for team task interdependence and virtualness, along with individual differences including agreeableness and conscientiousness. Transpersonal efficacy also contributes to the prediction of relationship conflict beyond the explained variance of collective efficacy. Originality/value This paper contributes to our understanding of individuals in teams by using social cognitive theory, expectancy theory and uncertainty reduction theory as a base for predicting the value of transpersonal efficacy in driving relational team behaviors. The authors uniquely consider efficacy as an interpersonal construct that is related to individual behaviors and attitudes that target specific teammates, rather than the team as a whole.

This information is based on a wide range of ocean observations using different systems and approaches. An integrated approach thus requires effective collaboration between areas of expertise in order to improve coordination at each step of the ocean observing value chain, from the design and deployment of multi-platform observations to their analysis and the delivery of products, sometimes through data assimilation in numerical models. Despite significant advances over the last two decades in more cooperation across the ocean observing activities, this integrated approach has not yet been fully realized. The ocean observing system still suffers from organizational silos due to independent and often disconnected initiatives, the strong and sometimes destructive competition across disciplines and among scientists, and the absence of a well-established overall governance framework. Here, we address the need for enhanced organizational integration among all the actors of ocean observing, focusing on the occidental systems. We advocate for a major evolution in the way we collaborate, calling for transformative scientific, cultural, behavioral, and management changes. This is timely because we now have the scientific and technical capabilities as well as urgent societal and political drivers. The ambition of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) and the various efforts to grow a sustainable ocean economy and effective ocean protection efforts all require a more integrated approach to ocean observing. After analyzing the barriers that currently prevent this full integration within the occidental systems, we suggest nine approaches for breaking down the silos and promoting better coordination and sharing. These recommendations are related to the organizational framework, the ocean science culture, the system of recognition and rewards, the data management system, the ocean governance structure, and the ocean observing drivers and funding. These reflections are intended to provide food for thought for further dialogue between all parties involved and trigger concrete actions to foster a real transformational change in ocean observing.

Around half this burden could be amenable to interventions that involve the provision of iron. Maize (corn) is one of the world's most important cereal grains and is cultivated across most of the globe. Several programmes around the world have fortified maize flour and other maize-derived foodstuffs with iron and other vitamins and minerals to combat anaemia and iron deficiency. Objectives To assess the effects of iron fortification of maize flour, corn meal and fortified maize flour products for anaemia and iron status in the general population. Search methods We searched the following international and regional sources in December 2017 and January 2018: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; MEDLINE (R) In Process; Embase; Web of Science (both the Social Science Citation Index and the Science Citation Index); CINAHL Ebsco; POPLINE; AGRICOLA (agricola.nal.usda.gov); BIOSIS (ISI); Bibliomap and TRoPHI; IBECS; Scielo; Global Index Medicus - AFRO (includes African Index Medicus); EMRO (includes Index Medicus for the Eastern Mediterranean Region); LILACS; PAHO (Pan American Health Library); WHOLIS (WHO Library); WPRO (includes Western Pacific Region Index Medicus); IMSEAR, Index Medicus for the South-East Asian Region; IndMED, Indian medical journals; and the Native Health Research Database. We searched clinicaltrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for any ongoing or planned studies on 17 January 2018 and contacted authors of such studies to obtain further information or eligible data if available. For assistance in identifying ongoing or unpublished studies, we also contacted relevant international organisations and agencies working in food fortification on 9 August 2016. Selection criteria We included cluster-or individually randomised controlled trials and observational studies. Interventions included (central/industrial) fortification of maize flour or corn meal with iron alone or with other vitamins and minerals and provided to individuals over 2 years of age (including pregnant and lactating women) from any country. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion, extracted data from included studies and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Trial designs with a comparison group were included to assess the effects of interventions. Trial designs without a control or comparison group (uncontrolled before-and-after studies) were included for completeness but were not considered in assessments of the overall effectiveness of interventions or used to draw conclusions regarding the effects of interventions in the review. Main results Our search yielded 4529 records. After initial screening of titles and abstracts, we reviewed the full text of 75 studies (80 records). We included 5 studies and excluded 70. All the included studies assessed the effects of providing maize products fortified with iron plus other vitamins and minerals versus unfortified maize flour. No studies compared this intervention to no intervention or looked at the relative effect of flour and products fortified with iron alone (without other vitamins and minerals). Three were randomised trials involving 2610 participants, and two were uncontrolled before-and-after studies involving 849 participants. Only three studies contributed data for the meta-analysis and included children aged 2 to 11.9 years and women. Compared to unfortified maize flour, it is uncertain whether fortifying maize flour or corn meal with iron and other vitamins and minerals has any effect on anaemia (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 1.40; 2 studies; 1027 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or on the risk of iron deficiency (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.15; 2 studies; 1102 participants; very low-certainty evidence), haemoglobin concentration (mean difference (MD) 1.25 g/L, 95% CI -2.36 to 4.86 g/L; 3 studies; 1144 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or ferritin concentrations (MD0.48 mu g/L, 95% CI-0.37 to 1.33 mu g/L; 1 study; 584 participants; very low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported on any adverse effects. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low based on GRADE, so we are uncertain whether the results reflect the true effect of the intervention. We downgraded evidence due to high risk of selection bias and unclear risk of performance bias in one of two included studies, high heterogeneity and wide CIs crossing the line of no effect for anaemia prevalence and haemoglobin concentration. Authors' conclusions It is uncertain whether fortifying maize flour with iron and other vitamins and minerals reduces the risk of anaemia or iron deficiency in children aged over 2 years or in adults. Moreover, the evidence is too uncertain to conclude whether iron-fortified maize flour, corn meal or fortified maize flour products have any effect on reducing the risk of anaemia or on improving haemoglobin concentration in the population. We are uncertain whether fortification of maize flour with iron reduces anaemia among the general population, as the certainty of the evidence is very low. No studies reported on any adverse effects. Public organisations funded three of the five included studies, while the private sector gave grants to universities to perform the other two. The presence of industry funding for some of these trials did not appear to positively influence results from these studies. The reduced number of studies, including only two age groups (children and women of reproductive age), as well as the limited number of comparisons (only one out of the four planned) constitute the main limitations of this review.

J	Hartson, HR				Hartson, HR			Cognitive, physical, sensory, and functional affordances in interaction design	BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								In reaction to Norman's (1999) essay on misuse of the term affordance in human-computer interaction literature, this article is a concept paper affirming the importance of this powerful concept, reinforcing Norman's distinctions of terminology, and expanding on the usefulness of the concepts in terms of their application to interaction design and evaluation. We define and use four complementary types of affordance in the context of interaction design and evaluation: cognitive affordance , physical affordance , sensory affordance , and functional affordance . The terms cognitive affordance (Norman's perceived affordance) and physical affordance (Norman's real affordance) refer to parallel and equally important usability concepts for interaction design, to which sensory affordance plays a supporting role. We argue that the concept of physical affordance carries a mandatory component of utility or purposeful action (functional affordance). Finally, we provide guidelines to help designers think about how these four kinds of affordance work together naturally in contextualized HCI design or evaluation.

Impact of imagery-enhanced interpretation training on offline and online interpretations in worry	BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY			English	Article						Cognitive bias modification of interpretation (CBM-I); Mental imagery; Interpretation bias; Repetitive negative thinking; Worry; Event-related potentials (ERP)	GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER; REPETITIVE NEGATIVE THINKING; INTERPRETATION BIAS MODIFICATION; MENTAL-IMAGERY; COGNITIVE-BIAS; POSITIVE THINKING; DEPRESSED MOOD; SOCIAL PHOBIA; THREAT; RUMINATION	Worry and rumination are forms of repetitive negative thinking (RNT) that are maintained by negative interpretations and a predominance of abstract, verbal thinking. Hence, facilitating more positive interpretations and imagery-based thinking in combination may reduce RNT. Study 1 administered interpretation training with and without enhanced imagery, and an active control condition (designed not to change interpretations), in individuals with high levels of RNT (worry and/or rumination). Combining interpretation training with sustained imagery resulted in the highest levels of positive interpretation bias using an offline test of interpretation bias (when individuals have time to reflect). Study 2 investigated whether imagery-enhanced interpretation training influences online interpretations when ambiguous information is first encountered, indexed by reaction times and amplitude of the N400 event-related potential, as well as enhances offline positive interpretations in high worriers. It also examined whether imagery-enhanced interpretation training reduces negative thought intrusions associated with worry. Both online (reaction time) and offline interpretations were more positive following imagery-enhanced interpretation training, and negative thoughts were reduced, compared to the active control. However, no differences emerged on neurophysiological markers during the online task. Hence, brief interpretation training encompassing sustained imagery modifies online and offline interpretations, but further training may be required to impact upon neurophysiological measures.

This argument is carried out on three levels of analysis: I) the reliance on information as the primary tool of government and the corresponding reversal of the conventional governmental toolbox, II) the development and use of informational and communicative techniques guiding behaviour, and III) the instruments, interfaces and artefacts supporting the informational networks and flows of nudging interventions.

Towards an Aspect-Oriented Design and Modelling Framework for Synthetic Biology	PROCESSES			English	Article						synthetic biology; CAD; mathematical modelling; host context; modularity; SynBioWeaver; aspect-oriented software engineering	APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; SYSTEMS BIOLOGY; ENGINEERING BIOLOGY; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; GROWTH-RATE; NETWORKS; CIRCUIT; LANGUAGE	Work on synthetic biology has largely used a component-based metaphor for system construction. While this paradigm has been successful for the construction of numerous systems, the incorporation of contextual design issueseither compositional, host or environmentalwill be key to realising more complex applications. Here, we present a design framework that radically steps away from a purely parts-based paradigm by using aspect-oriented software engineering concepts. We believe that the notion of concerns is a powerful and biologically credible way of thinking about system synthesis. By adopting this approach, we can separate core concerns, which represent modular aims of the design, from cross-cutting concerns, which represent system-wide attributes. The explicit handling of cross-cutting concerns allows for contextual information to enter the design process in a modular way. As a proof-of-principle, we implemented the aspect-oriented approach in the Python tool, SynBioWeaver, which enables the combination, or weaving, of core and cross-cutting concerns. The power and flexibility of this framework is demonstrated through a number of examples covering the inclusion of part context, combining circuit designs in a context dependent manner, and the generation of rule, logic and reaction models from synthetic circuit designs.

The systematic nature of evaluation that is built into the operational workflow of a practice setting may increase the diversity of methods available to explore processes and outcomes of interest. We propose a novel conceptual framework that uses a human-centered systems lens to foster such embedded evaluation in clinical routine. This approach emphasizes the evaluator-practitioner partnership to build confidence in the bi-directional learning of practice-based evidence with evidence-based practice. The iterative cycles inherent to design thinking are aimed at developing better evaluation questions. The attention to structure and context inherent to systems thinking is intended to support meaningful perspectives in the naturally complex world of health care. Importantly, the combined human-centered systems lens can create greater awareness of the influence of individual and systemic biases that exist in any endeavor or institution that involves people. Recommended tools and strategies include systems mapping, program theory development, and visual facilitation using a logic model to represent the complexity of mental health treatment for communication, shared understanding, and connection to the broader evidence base. To illustrate elements of the proposed conceptual framework, two case examples are drawn from routine outcome monitoring (ROM) and progress feedback. We conclude with questions for future collaboration and research that may strengthen the partnership of evaluators and practitioners as a community of learners in service of local and system-level improvement.

Usually PEK would show a QWERTY keyboard when users input text like an email or amessage. Nevertheless, whenever users enter a password in the input box on his or her touch-enabled device, a keyboard will be shown to them with the positions of the characters shuffled at random. PEK has been released on the Google Play since 2014. However, the number of installations has not lived up to our expectation. For the purpose of usable security and privacy, we designed a two-stage usability test and performed two rounds of iterative usability testing in 2016 and 2017 summer with continuous improvements of PEK. The observations from the usability testing are educational: (1) convenience plays a critical role when users select an input method; (2) people think those attacks that PEK prevents are remote from them.

J	Svarre, T; Russell-Rose, T				Svarre, Tanja; Russell-Rose, Tony			Think outside the search box: A comparative study of visual and form-based query builders	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						Boolean search; professional search; query formulation; systematic review; user experience; user interface	GO	Knowledge workers such as healthcare information professionals, legal researchers and librarians need to create and execute search strategies that are comprehensive, transparent and reproducible. The traditional solution is to use proprietary query-building tools provided by literature database vendors. In the majority of cases, these query builders are designed using a form-based paradigm that requires the user to enter keywords and ontology terms on a line-by-line basis and then combine them using Boolean operators. However, recent years have witnessed significant changes in human-computer interaction technologies, and users can now engage with online information systems using a variety of novel data visualisation techniques. In this article, we evaluate a new approach to query building in which users express concepts as objects on a visual canvas and compare this with a traditional form-based query builder in a laboratory-based user study. The results demonstrate the potential of visual interfaces to mitigate some of the shortcomings associated with form-based interfaces and encourage more exploratory search behaviour. They also demonstrate the value of having a temporary 'scratch' space in query formulation. In addition, the findings highlight an ongoing need for transparency and reproducibility in professional search and raise further questions about how these properties may best be supported.

Advancing engagement methods for trials: the CORE study relational model of engagement for a stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial of experience-based co-design for people living with severe mental illnesses	TRIALS			English	Article						Engagement model; Stepped wedge design; Cluster randomised controlled trial; Complex interventions; Experience-based co-design	COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT; HEALTH-CARE; PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; PATIENT; RECRUITMENT; INTERVENTIONS; INVOLVEMENT; RETENTION; FRAMEWORK	Background: Engagement is essential in trials research but is rarely embedded across all stages of the research continuum. The development, use, effectiveness and value of engagement in trials research is poorly researched and understood, and models of engagement are rarely informed by theory. This article describes an innovative methodological approach for the development and application of a relational model of engagement in a stepped wedge designed cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT), the CORE study. The purpose of the model is to embed engagement across the continuum of the trial which will test if an experience-based co-design intervention improves psychosocial recovery for people affected by severe mental illness. Methods: The model was developed in three stages and used a structured iterative approach. A context mapping assessment of trial sites was followed by a literature review on recruitment and retention of hardto-reach groups in complex interventions and RCTs. Relevant theoretical and philosophical underpinnings were identified by an additional review of literature to inform model development and enactment of engagement activities. Results: Policy, organisational and service user data combined with evidence from the literature on barriers to recruitment provided contextual information. Four perspectives support the theoretical framework of the relational model of engagement and this is organised around two facets: the relational and continuous. The relational facet is underpinned by relational ethical theories and participatory action research principles. The continuous facet is supported by systems thinking and translation theories. These combine to enact an ethics of engagement and evoke knowledge mobilisation to reach the higher order goals of the model. Conclusions: Engagement models are invaluable for trials research, but there are opportunities to advance their theoretical development and application, particularly within stepped wedge designed studies where there may be a significant waiting period between enrolment in a study and receipt of an intervention.

For such black holes, we show that the information entering a black hole becomes encoded in correlations within a tripartite quantum state, the quantum analogue of a one-time pad, and is only decoded into the outgoing radiation very late in the evaporation. This behavior generically describes the unitary evaporation of highly entangled black holes and requires no specially designed evolution. Our work suggests the existence of a matter-field sum rule for any fundamental theory.

Acceptability of a standalone written leaflet for the National Health Service for England Targeted Lung Health Check Programme: A concurrent, think-aloud study	HEALTH EXPECTATIONS			English	Article						decision aid; decision-making; informed choice; lung cancer screening	CANCER; INFORMATION; UNCERTAINTY	Background Many countries are introducing low-dose computed tomography screening programmes for people at high risk of lung cancer. Effective communication strategies that convey risks and benefits, including unfamiliar concepts and outcome probabilities based on population risk, are critical to achieving informed choice and mitigating inequalities in uptake. Methods This study investigated the acceptability of an aspect of NHS England's communication strategy in the form of a leaflet that was used to invite and inform eligible adults about the Targeted Lung Health Check (TLHC) programme. Acceptability was assessed in terms of how individuals engaged with, comprehended and responded to the leaflet. Semi-structured, 'think aloud' interviews were conducted remotely with 40 UK screening-naive current and former smokers (aged 55-73). The verbatim transcripts were analysed thematically using a coding framework based on the Dual Process Theory of cognition. Results The leaflet helped participants understand the principles and procedures of screening and fostered cautiously favourable intentions. Three themes captured the main results of the data analysis: (1) Response-participants experienced anxiety about screening results and further investigations, but the involvement of specialist healthcare professionals was reassuring; (2) Engagement-participants were rapidly drawn to information about lung cancer prevalence, and benefits of screening, but deliberated slowly about early diagnosis, risks of screening and less familiar symptoms of lung cancer; (3) Comprehension-participants understood the main principles of the TLHC programme, but some were confused by its rationale and eligibility criteria. Radiation risks, abnormal screening results and numerical probabilities of screening outcomes were hard to understand. Conclusion The TLHC information leaflet appeared to be acceptable to the target population. There is scope to improve aspects of comprehension and engagement in ways that would support informed choice as a distributed process in lung cancer screening. Patient or Public Contribution The insight and perspectives of patient representatives directly informed and improved the design and conduct of this study.

However, many organizations struggle with how to apply them appropriately. In this article, we describe a model of the effects of rapidly evolving EC capabilities on organizations. The model proposes that Internet and EC Technologies influence Competitive Environments and lead to new EC-based Business Strategies. The information demands of new Business and Organization Models designed to implement these strategies necessitate changes to Information Systems in firms. The model also proposes that two cycles of EC change exist. First is an internal cycle in which Business Strategies drive new Business and Organization Models, which in turn require new Information Systems capabilities. These capabilities enable the implementation of more new Business Strategies. Externally, new Information Systems requirements prompt new Internet and EC Technologies, which further influence the Competitive Environment; hence, second is the external cycle. Some researchers think that these,cycles will not only continue, but also accelerate. This research provides a model and suggests avenues for further study of EC-invoked change. It also furnishes organizations with an understanding so that they can better position themselves to compete as EC capabilities are applied in their individual industries.

J	Sheetz, SD; Tegarden, DP				Sheetz, SD; Tegarden, DP			Illustrating the cognitive consequences of object-oriented systems development	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						object-oriented; cognitive activities; systems analysis and design; content analysis	DESIGN; REQUIREMENTS; MAPS	The purported "naturalness" of object-oriented (OO) approaches refers to the assertion that an alignment exists among the innate cognitive activities of system designers and the characteristics of OO system development approaches. That is, designers can think about the objects that make up the system in the same way they think about objects in the world. This fit of cognitive activities and OO characteristics appeals to many system developers. Contrary to the claim of naturalness, many students and practitioners report difficulties learning and using OO techniques. To understand why OO approaches seem to be difficult to learn and use, we illustrate the consistency of common characteristics of OO techniques and the cognitive activities of systems designers. A group of graduate students identified 148 beliefs, facts, and ideas pertaining to OO complexity. Researchers classified each item in terms of the abstraction, communication, problem-orientation, and shared behavior characteristics common to OO approaches. Then classified each item in terms of the problem understanding, problem decomposition, and design solution cognitive activities. The consistency of the two classifications confirms that claims are supported by usage. However, it seems that methodology and project management are part of the task of developing information systems (ISs) that are not adequately addressed by OO approaches.

The intervention included three enhancements to the quality report offered to the control: (a) biweekly text messages or e-mails directing women to the website, (b) videos and materials describing the relevance of quality measures to pregnant women's interests, and (c) tools to support discussions with clinicians. Compared with controls, intervention participants were significantly more likely to visit the website and report adopting behaviors to inform care, such as thinking through preferences, talking with their doctor, or creating a birth plan. Reports designed to put quality information into the larger context of what consumers want and need to know, along with targeted and timely communications, can increase consumer use of quality information and prompt them to talk with providers about care preferences and evidence-based practices.

Comparison of competences between Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Non-Problem-Based graduate nurses in a Provincial Hospital in South Africa	LIFE SCIENCE JOURNAL-ACTA ZHENGZHOU UNIVERSITY OVERSEAS EDITION			English	Article						Problem Based Learning; Problem solving; critical thinking; collaboration		The study sought to compare the competences between PBL and Non-problem based graduate nurses in a Provincial Hospital in South Africa. This was a comparative descriptive and cross-sectional design. Data was collected with self constructed questionnaires which were handed out during duty hours to graduate nurses who were present at the time of data collection. The findings revealed the top 5 most ranked competences by both groups as critical thinking, problem solving, long-life learning, collaboration with other medical team and holistic approach to health care. 13 nurses out of 20 participants of PBL group ranked critical thinking in the 1st position compared to the Non-PBL graduates who ranked it at 11th. Problem solving was ranked at 2nd position by 45.0% of PBL group while about 21.4% the Non-PBL ranked it at 5th position. The PBL group (25.0%) ranked long-life learning as at the 3rd position as compared to Non-PBL group (28.6%) who ranked it at 13th position. Graduates of the PBL approach ranked critical thinking, problem solving, and lifelong learning highly as compared to the Non-PBL graduates. PBL graduates also indicated that they continue with updating their professional knowledge through the use of information technology. [Useh U, Mosebudi D, Tsolo G, Kgwakgwa D. K.

Many patients are disabled and their communication is restricted during the ICU stay. Specific information on procedures, sensations and coping behavior are thought to reduce anxiety on the ICU. Until now information programs to reduce anxiety were mainly delivered preoperatively, completely neglecting informational needs of non-elective ICU patients. Methods: The trial is designed as a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial in the cities of Marburg, Halle and Stuttgart. Elective and non-elective ICU patients will be included. The trial includes an intervention and a control group on the ICU. The control group receives a trivial conversation without any ICU-specific information. The intervention group receives an information program with specific procedural, sensory and coping information about their ICU stay. Both conversations take place in the ICU and are planned to take about 10 minutes. Discussion: In contrast to former trials on information programs on the ICU-stay our intervention will take place in the ICU itself. This approach will ensure to compensate for memory effects due to anesthesia or preoperative stress. Further the results will be applicable to non-elective ICU-patients.

Design: Taking an infodemiology perspective, this research employed multilevel analyses to examine how COVID-19 online query data (i.e., Google topic search terms Coronavirus and COVID-19) and coronavirus epidemiological data (i.e., COVID-19 cases per million and case fatality rate) would predict condom information seeking behavior online (i.e., Google topic search term Condom) throughout the pandemic across American states (Study 1) and 102 countries/territories (Study 2), after accounting for death-thought accessibility (i.e., illness-related searches), interest in birth control (i.e., birth-control-related searches), COVID-19 control policy, stay at home behavior, season, religious holidays, yearly trends, autocorrelation, and contextual variables such as HIV prevalence rate and socioeconomic development indicators (GINI index, urbanization, etc.). Results: When there were high levels of COVID-19 concerns in cyberspace in a given week, search volume for condoms increased from the previous week across American states and different countries/territories. By contrast, the effect of actual coronavirus threat was non-significant. Conclusion: Seeking information about condoms online could be a reactive response to high levels of COVID-19 concerns across different populations.

Pilot analysis of the Motivation Assessment for Team Readiness, Integration, and Collaboration (MATRICx) using Rasch analysis	JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						Research Design; Translational Medical Research	TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH; SCIENCE; BEHAVIOR	Healthcare services and the production of healthcare knowledge are increasingly dependent on highly functioning, multidisciplinary teams, requiring greater awareness of individuals' readiness to collaborate in translational science teams. Yet, there is no comprehensive tool of individual motivations and threats to collaboration that can guide preparation of individuals for work on well-functioning teams. This prospective pilot study evaluated the preliminary psychometric properties of the Motivation Assessment for Team Readiness, Integration, and Collaboration (MATRICx). We examined 55 items of the MATRICx in a sample of 125 faculty, students and researchers, using contemporary psychometric methods (Rasch analysis). We found that the motivator and threat items formed separate constructs relative to collaboration readiness. Further, respondents who identified themselves as inexperienced at working on collaborative projects defined the motivation construct differently from experienced respondents. These results are consistent with differences in strategic alliances described in the literaturefor example, inexperienced respondents reflected features of cooperation and coordination, such as concern with sharing information and compatibility of goals. In contrast, the more experienced respondents were concerned with issues that reflected a collective purpose, more typical of collaborative alliances. While these different types of alliances are usually described as representing varying aspects along a continuum, our findings suggest that collaboration might be better thought of as a qualitatively different state than cooperation or coordination. These results need to be replicated in larger samples, but the findings have implications for the development and design of educational interventions that aim to ready scientists and clinicians for greater interdisciplinary work.

J	He, YM; Wang, Y; Chen, YW; Xing, LN				He, Yongming; Wang, Yuan; Chen, Yingwu; Xing, Lining			AUTO MISSION PLANNING SYSTEM DESIGN FOR IMAGING SATELLITES AND ITS APPLICATIONS IN ENVIRONMENTAL FIELD	POLISH MARITIME RESEARCH			English	Article						systems engineering; imaging satellite; meteorological monitoring; space-ground integration		Satellite hardware has reached a level of development that enables imaging satellites to realize applications in the area of meteorology and environmental monitoring. As the requirements in terms of feasibility and the actual profit achieved by satellite applications increase, we need to comprehensively consider the actual status, constraints, unpredictable information, and complicated requirements. The management of this complex information and the allocation of satellite resources to realize image acquisition have become essential for enhancing the efficiency of satellite instrumentation. In view of this, we designed a satellite auto mission planning system, which includes two sub-systems: the imaging satellite itself and the ground base, and these systems would then collaborate to process complicated missions: the satellite mainly focuses on mission planning and functions according to actual parameters, whereas the ground base provides auxiliary information, management, and control. Based on the requirements analysis, we have devised the application scenarios, main module, and key techniques. Comparison of the simulation results of the system, confirmed the feasibility and optimization efficiency of the system framework, which also stimulates new thinking for the method of monitoring environment and design of mission planning systems.

The present study aimed at disentangling the effects of three mindfulness techniques on mental rumination and subjective time perspective. Design: 75 young healthy participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: mindful breathing, body scan, observing-thoughts meditation and an active control condition. The meditation groups practiced mindfulness daily and attended weekly group meetings for 8 weeks, while the control group was involved in reading and discussing a book about mindfulness. Main outcome measures: Self-report measures of mindfulness skills, ruminative thinking, attitude towards time, anxiety, depression and personality traits. Results: In all meditation conditions, analysis of covariance showed a significant improvement in mindfulness skills compared to the control group. We found a specific effect of mindful breathing in reducing participants' tendency to brooding and in increasing their positive vision of the future, compared to all other conditions. Conclusions: As expected, we found some differential effects: breathing meditation helped practitioners to train more effectively their ability to disengage from maladaptive ruminative thoughts, which could be reflected in a more optimistic attitude toward the future. These results provide useful information to structure better mindfulness-based interventions.

J	Jun, M; Chung, EY				Jun, Minje; Chung, Eui-Young			Design of On-Chip Crossbar Network Topology Using Chained Edge Partitioning	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						on-chip network; topology; synthesis	METHODOLOGY	This paper proposes an efficient topology synthesis method for on-chip interconnection network based on crossbar switches. The efficiency of topology synthesis methods is often measured by two metrics-the quality of the synthesized topology and synthesis time. These two metrics are critically determined by the definition of the topology design space and the exploration method. Furthermore, an efficient representing method for the design space is required to tightly link the design space and the exploration method. Even though topology synthesis methods have actively been researched, most of the previous methods were not deep in thought for these factors. Unlike the previous methods, we propose a topology synthesis method with a careful consideration of these factors. Our method efficiently defines the design space by a technique called chained edge partitioning, in conjunction with a representing method for the points in the space, called enhanced restricted growth function. We also provide an exploration method which well incorporates with the aforementioned search space. To prove the effectiveness of our method, we compared our method with previous methods. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the compared methods by up to 49.8% and 104.6x in the quality of the synthesized topology and the synthesis time, respectively.

Management of asthma in childhood: study protocol of a systematic evidence update by the Paediatric Asthma in Real Life (PeARL) Think Tank	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						paediatrics; asthma; paediatric thoracic medicine; thoracic medicine	INHALER	Introduction Clinical recommendations for childhood asthma are often based on data extrapolated from studies conducted in adults, despite significant differences in mechanisms and response to treatments. The Paediatric Asthma in Real Life (PeARL) Think Tank aspires to develop recommendations based on the best available evidence from studies in children. An overview of systematic reviews (SRs) on paediatric asthma maintenance management and an SR of treatments for acute asthma attacks in children, requiring an emergency presentation with/without hospital admission will be conducted. Methods and analysis Standard methodology recommended by Cochrane will be followed. Maintenance pharmacotherapy of childhood asthma will be evaluated in an overview of SRs published after 2005 and including clinical trials or real-life studies. For evaluating pharmacotherapy of acute asthma attacks leading to an emergency presentation with/without hospital admission, we opted to conduct de novo synthesis in the absence of adequate up-to-date published SRs. For the SR of acute asthma pharmacotherapy, we will consider eligible SRs, clinical trials or real-life studies without time restrictions. Our evidence updates will be based on broad searches of Pubmed/Medline and the Cochrane Library. We will use A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews, V.2, Cochrane risk of bias 2 and REal Life EVidence AssessmeNt Tool to evaluate the methodological quality of SRs, controlled clinical trials and real-life studies, respectively. Next, we will further assess interventions for acute severe asthma attacks with positive clinical results in meta-analyses. We will include both controlled clinical trials and observational studies and will assess their quality using the previously mentioned tools. We will employ random effect models for conducting meta-analyses, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology to assess certainty in the body of evidence. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required for SRs. Our findings will be published in peer reviewed journals and will inform clinical recommendations being developed by the PeARL Think Tank.

J	Chen, YC; Wu, HK; Hsin, CT				Chen, Yi-Chun; Wu, Hsin-Kai; Hsin, Ching-Ting			A systematic review of assessments for young children's scientific and engineering practices	RESEARCH IN SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION			English	Review; Early Access						Assessment; early childhood science; young children; scientific practice; engineering practice; systematic review	SCIENCE-EDUCATION; INQUIRY; KINDERGARTEN; THINKING; SKILLS; PERFORMANCE; ELEMENTARY; GENDER; IMPACT; GIRLS	Background and Purpose As a growing number of instructional units have been developed to promote young children's scientific and engineering practices (SEPs), understanding how to evaluate and assess children's SEPs is imperative. However, paper-and-pencil assessments would not be suitable for young children because of their limited reading and writing skills. To explore the assessments for SEPs available for young children aged 3-8 years, this study reviewed assessments of young children's SEPs reported in empirical studies, and analysed the characteristics of these assessments to delineate how young children's SEPs have been measured. Methods We followed the procedures of a systematic review proposed by Zawacki-Richter et al. (2020). The EBSCOhost database was used to gather empirical studies in education and psychology. A total of 46 articles published from 2003 to 2020 met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Findings The findings indicated that of the eight SEPs suggested by the National Research Council (2012), Analysing and interpreting data was assessed the most, followed by Using mathematics and computational thinking, Constructing explanations and designing solutions, and Planning and carrying out investigations. A majority of assessments were designed for children of 4, 5, and 6 years old and used paper-based visualizations and real objects to present the tasks and items. Additionally, due to the verbal or performance nature of the SEPs, the assessments collected different types of data as evidence to evaluate children's SEPs. Performance-based assessments were the most common, followed by multiple-choice, ranking, and oral responses. Conclusion The findings of the reviewed assessments revealed a variety of performance expectations of SEPs and suggested that some SEPs are measurable and developmentally appropriate for young children. Also, the availability of assessments is uneven in different types of SEPs, and more assessments for information communication and modelling practices are needed.

J	Riggs, P				Riggs, Peter			THE TEMPORAL EPISTEMIC ANORMALY	MANUSCRITO			English	Article						Temporal anomaly; Causal loop; Non-invented information; Backwards causation; Time travel	CAUSAL LOOPS; TIME-TRAVEL; INFORMATION; PARADOXES; PHYSICS	It is not uncommon in time travel stories to find that the mechanism by which the time travel is achieved is not invented. A time traveller could journey to his/her own past and give the designs of the time travel machine to his/her earlier self as s/he was given the designs as a younger person. These designs never get thought up by anyone. Such a situation would conflict with the usual conception of the acquisition of knowledge. This situation is called the Temporal Epistemic Anomaly and would arise if knowledge is gained at a time prior to the information in question being transmitted but is not discovered or invented at any time. This article examines the implications of information propagating around a causal chain that is closed in time (which is required to create the Anomaly) and whether this information need have a specific origin point.

J	Su, YW; Chen, GF; Li, MY; Shi, TF; Fang, DD				Su, Yawen; Chen, Guofu; Li, Moyan; Shi, Tengfei; Fang, Diandian			Design and Implementation of Web Multimedia Teaching Evaluation System Based on Artificial Intelligence and jQuery	MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								It is an important reflection of modern education and an overwhelming way to strengthen the quality of teaching. In the current environment, the traditional multimedia classroom management model can no longer adapt to the current rapidly developing network environment. How to manage more and more campus multimedia classrooms is an urgent problem to be solved. The informatization construction and application of multimedia classrooms is the key to the realization of educational informatization. The traditional multimedia classroom management model has not been able to adapt to the rapidly developing network environment, which is mainly manifested in the following aspects: electronic education management personnel cannot discover and process teaching in a timely manner. Equipment failure has not formed a set of standard troubleshooting procedures and cannot accurately record the status, use time, and maintenance records of various teaching pieces of equipment. This will not only affect the teaching quality of colleges and universities but also slow down the process of education informatization. This paper develops a web-based multimedia teaching equipment management system based on artificial intelligence and jQuery, which realizes the centralized control and management of various multimedia teaching equipment. According to the actual needs of multimedia teaching, this paper follows the design and development of software engineering, using artificial intelligence, jQuery, Ajax, and Spring MVC technology to design and develop a web-based multimedia teaching equipment management system. On the basis of realizing the centralized control and management of multiple multimedia teaching equipment, it can also track and record the use status and maintenance content of the multimedia teaching equipment to form an information knowledge base of the multimedia equipment, which is convenient for later maintenance and management. Through the use of this system, management can be systematized, standardized, and automated, reducing the tedious workload of management and maintenance personnel. It can speed up the information management process of multimedia teaching equipment and improve the work efficiency of related managers. A course can be studied online, and an online teaching system has been developed. According to our survey on Mandarin online course training in Northwest China (N=343), we found that 81.6% of samples are satisfied with the Mandarin online training courses; 21.6% think that they have learned new teaching methods/teaching concepts from the teacher through the Mandarin training; 36.2% think that they have learned the theoretical knowledge of Mandarin through the Mandarin training. Gender, age, ethnicity, and learning experience are related to the difficulty of learning Mandarin online courses. Therefore, we can satisfy learners of different ages, learning foundations, and cultural backgrounds by designing different online course patterns, so as to enhance the high-quality promotion of Mandarin.

Now, scientists must act more like software engineers to design models and perform analysis that use principles and techniques pioneered by software developers. Creating reproducible models that are easy to use and understand is in the best interest for the snow and hydrology community, enabling studies by other researchers and facilitating technology transfer to operational applications. Here, we present the Automated Water Supply Model (AWSM) that streamlines and standardizes the workflow of a physically based snow model to create fully reproducible model simulations that can be utilized by researchers and operational water resource managers. AWSM orchestrates four core components that historically required significant, ad-hoc modeler interaction to load the input data, spatially interpolate to the modeling domain, run the models and process the outputs. Because AWSM was developed using principles and techniques from software engineering, users can quickly perform reproducible simulations on any operating system, from a laptop to the cloud. The three fully reproducible example case studies showcase the simplicity and flexibility of using AWSM to perform simulations from small research catchments to simulations that aid in real time water management decisions.

For safe experiments, the system displays messages that alert a student to avoid a possible accident based on the operational context. Simultaneously, the system is designed to facilitate active thinking, in which the key concept is multiple interpretations of a message, to avoid dependency on the system in future experiments. The concept of an information presentation with three-dimensional ambiguity, i.e., semantic, spatial and temporal, is presented. A prototype application A 3 (A-CUBE) is presented, which extracts various operational contexts in a chemistry experiment from the usage of experimental apparatus and materials. We report the usability experiment and discuss the feasibility of a presentation with ambiguity for active thinking. Additionally, the design principle of a message with semantic ambiguity and future work are presented.

J	Collins, PJ; Hahn, U				Collins, Peter J.; Hahn, Ulrike			We Might Be Wrong, but We Think That Hedging Doesn't Protect Your Reputation	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION			English	Article						cooperation; hedging; pragmatics; testimony; belief change	UNCERTAINTY; LANGUAGE; BELIEVE; COMMUNICATION; PERSUASION; VALIDITY; MIND	We gain much of our knowledge from other people. Because people are fallible-they lie, mislead, and are mistaken-it seems essential to monitor their claims and their reliability as sources of information. An intuitive way to do this is to draw on our expectations about claims and sources: to perform expectation-based updating (Hahn, Merdes, & von Sydow, 2018). But this updating can have damaging consequences, leading us into a kind of confirmation bias. An alternative is to keep track of outcomes and record whether a claim proves true or false: to perform outcome-based updating (Hahn et al., 2018). This form of updating does not have the negative repercussions on belief accuracy. But both forms of updating might undermine the trust and cooperation assumed to be necessary for successful communication. We explore a potential boundary condition on these types of updating. We investigate whether speakers can protect their reputation when they make claims with low prior probability, with and without knowledge of the final outcome. We explore suggestions from McCready (2015) that speakers can protect themselves by hedging with evidential language: in particular with weaker propositional attitudes ("I suspect that...") and so-called double hedges ("I might be wrong, but I think..."). We find that both forms of updating are robust to hedging with this evidential language and find no clear evidence for a protective effect. We discuss extra ingredients that may allow successful hedging.

Despite being a priority goal of government and development agencies, in a heterogeneous society like Nepal, FP can be an issue that needs to be dealt with consideration for religious and cultural beliefs of different sections of society. Despite steady progress in achieving FP goals, minority populations have lagged behind the rest of the country in achieving improved family health outcomes; Muslim community being one such example. Objectives: This study aims to explore the existing situation of FP use in Muslim communities and to identify key policy-related issues affecting the access to and utilization of FP services. Settings and design: Mixed approach was used in Kapilbastu district, which accommodated the larger proportion of Muslims in Nepal. Materials and methods: Interview was conducted among 160 married women using semi-structured questionnaire. Focus group discussion, key informant interviews, and consultative meeting were the qualitative techniques employed in this study. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics (Chi-square test), while qualitative data by thematic approach. Results: More than half of women (56.0%) expressed their interest in FP use, while reported users were just below the quarter (24.0%). Husband approval and secrecy of their personal identity affect use of any method of contraception. Future plan for children and prior information regarding FP found to affect current use of FP, significantly. FP word itself was found to be stigmatizing, so women prefer replacing the word FP with culturally appropriate one. Furthermore, incorporating it into comprehensive package for improving women's health will definitely contribute to improve access and uptake of services. Conclusion: Discrepancy exists between current use and desire for use of FP among Muslim women in future. This highlights the inadequacy of implementing the current blanket policy and programs related to FP and offer ways to move forward with the national FP agenda ensuring the cultural rights and non-discrimination of women.

Enhancing the quality and social impacts of urban planning through community-engaged operations research	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE			English	Article						Smart cities; urban planning; community-engaged operations research; problem structuring methods; systems thinking	VALUE-FOCUSED THINKING; FUTURE	While inquiry in operations research (OR) modeling of urban planning processes is long-standing, on the whole, the OR discipline has not influenced urban planning practice, teaching and scholarship at a level of other domains such as public policy and information technology. Urban planning presents contemporary challenges that are complex, multi-stakeholder, data-intensive, and ill structured. Could an OR approach which focuses on the complex, emergent nature of cities, the institutional environment in which urban planning strategies are designed and implemented and which puts citizen engagement and a critical approach at the center enable urban planning to better meet these challenges? Based on a review of research and practice in OR and urban planning, we argue that a prospective and prescriptive approach to planning that is inductive in nature and embraces "methodological pluralism" and mixed methods can enable researchers and practitioners develop effective interventions that are equitable and which reflect the concerns of community members and community serving organizations. We discuss recent work in transportation, housing, and community development that illustrates the benefits of embracing an enhanced OR modeling approach both in the framing of the model and in its implementation, while bringing to the fore three cautionary themes. First, a mechanistic application of decision modeling principles rooted in stylized representations of institutions and systems using mathematics and computational methods may not adequately capture the central role that human actors play in developing neighborhoods and communities. Second, as innovations such as the mass adoption of automobiles decades ago led to auto-centric city design show, technological innovations can have unanticipated negative social impacts. Third, the current COVID pandemic shows that approaches based on science and technology alone are inadequate to improving community lives. Therefore, we emphasize the important role of critical approaches, community engagement and diversity, equity, and inclusion in planning approaches that incorporate decision modeling.

However, many current help systems are often ignored or found to be too complicated to use by clinicians. In this article, we suggest an approach that allows designers to think about user support and automating tasks in ways users find more acceptable. The issue we address in particular is the notion of transparency and to what extent it allows the end-user to understand and critique the advice given. We have found that one central problem with existing support systems is that often the end-user does not understand the differences between the automated parts and the parts that have to be done manually. By taking aspects of transparency and control into account when designing an automated tool it seems that some of the more refractory issues that help systems pose for professional users can be addressed.

J	Cao, DX; Zhang, MD; Li, ZJ				Cao, Dongxing; Zhang, Mandun; Li, Zhanjun			Customer Preference-Based Information Retrieval to Build Module Concepts	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								Preference is viewed as an outer feeling of a product, also as a reflection of human's inner thought. It dominates the designers' decisions and affects our purchase intention. In the paper, a model of preference elicitation from customers is proposed to build module concepts. Firstly, the attributes of customer preference are classified in a hierarchy and make the surveys to build customer preference concepts. Secondly, the documents or catalogs of design requirements, perhaps containing some textual description and geometric data, are normalized by using semantic expressions. Some semantic rules are developed to describe low-level features of customer preference to construct a knowledge base of customer preference. Thirdly, designers' needs are used to map customer preference for generating module concepts.

We study this problem with the r-complex contagion model, where each uninfected vertex in the network becomes infected if it has at least r infected neighbors. We focus on a random graph model called the stochastic hierarchical blockmodel. When the graph is not exceptionally sparse, under certain mild assumptions, we prove the optimal seeding strategy puts all the seeds in a single community. This matches the intuition that, in a nonsubmodular cascade model, placing seeds near each other creates synergy. However, it sharply contrasts with the intuition for submodular cascade models (e.g., the independent cascade model) in which nearby seeds tend to erode each others' effects. We use this observation to design a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm for a slightly more general setting. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Aged care providers collect an abundance of data, yet rarely are these data integrated and transformed in real-time into actionable information to support evidence-based care, nor are they shared with older people and informal caregivers. This protocol describes the co-design and testing of a dashboard in residential aged care facilities (nursing or care homes) and community-based aged care settings (formal care provided at home or in the community). The dashboard will comprise integrated data to provide an 'at-a-glance' overview of aged care clients, indicators to identify clients at risk of fall-related hospitalisations and poor quality of life, and evidence-based decision support to minimise these risks. Longer term plans for dashboard implementation and evaluation are also outlined. Methods This mixed-method study will involve (1) co-designing dashboard features with aged care staff, clients, informal caregivers and general practitioners (GPs), (2) integrating aged care data silos and developing risk models, and (3) testing dashboard prototypes with users. The dashboard features will be informed by direct observations of routine work, interviews, focus groups and co-design groups with users, and a community forum. Multivariable discrete time survival models will be used to develop risk indicators, using predictors from linked historical aged care and hospital data. Dashboard prototype testing will comprise interviews, focus groups and walk-through scenarios using a think-aloud approach with staff members, clients and informal caregivers, and a GP workshop. Ethics and dissemination This study has received ethical approval from the New South Wales (NSW) Population & Health Services Research Ethics Committee and Macquarie University's Human Research Ethics Committee. The research findings will be presented to the aged care provider who will share results with staff members, clients, residents and informal caregivers. Findings will be disseminated as peer-reviewed journal articles, policy briefs and conference presentations.

The knowledge base for solving this problem is a hybrid consisting of numerical data, declarative facts, and heuristic rules. Design rules were derived from an integration of the information about the performance of the catalyst, reaction mechanism, and the nature of the active sites. An example for a specific case is constructed on the basis of compositional and kinetic data for mixed metal oxide catalysts used to reduce carbon monoxide with hydrogen to alcohols. An inference engine was constructed by simulating the kine of thinking that an experienced catalyst designer employs. By this method, an expert system can guide the search for an optimum catalyst formulation, its preparation procedure, and the best reaction conditions to achieve the specified selectivity of the desired product. In this way, the expert system can provide a path to the design of the catalyst through a systematic and logically structured database that is accessible and interactive.

J	Marcinkowski, M; Fonseca, F				Marcinkowski, Michael; Fonseca, Fred			The Conditions of Peak Empiricism in Big Data and Interaction Design	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								An influx of mechanisms for the collection of large sets of data has prompted widespread consideration of the impact that data analytic methods can have on a number of disciplines. Having an established record of the use of a unique mixture of empirical methods, the work of understanding and designing for user behavior is well situated to take advantage of the advances claimed by "big data" methods. Beyond any straightforward benefit of the use of large sets of data, such an increase in the scale of empirical evidence has far-reaching implications for the work of empirically guided design. We develop the concept of "peak empiricism" to explain the new role that large-scale data comes to play in design, one in which data become more than a simple empirical tool. In providing such an expansive empirical setting for design, big data weakens the subjective conditions necessary for empirical insight, pointing to a more performative approach to the relationship between a designer and his or her work. In this, the work of design is characterized as "thinking with" the data in a partnership that weakens not only any sense of empiricism but also the agentive foundations of a classical view of design work.

Low levels of human and organisational performance have been shown to be a prime cause of railway accidents and a number of accident models and methods have been developed in order to probe deeper into the role played by organisational factors in accident causation. The Systems-Theoretical Accident Modelling and Processes (STAMP) method for example, represents a promising systematic and systemic way of examining sociotechnical systems such as the railway. Another method, the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS), based upon Reason's model of human error in an organisational context, has also proved popular as a human factors accident analysis framework. However, human factors elements are still somewhat limited and under-specified and these managerial and social issues within an organisation are simply regarded as sources of failure in the control constraints of STAMP. HFACS likewise, categorises accident data rather than analysing it in more depth. In this context, a hybrid human and organisational analysis method based on HFACS-STAMP (HFACS-STAMP method for railway accidents, HS-RAs) is proposed to identify and analyse human and organisational factors involved in railway accidents. Using the categories of human errors derived from HFACS and the structured systematic analysis process of STAMP, the HS-RAs method provides a mechanism by which active failures can promulgate across organisations and give a systemic analysis of human error in accidents. Combined with human information processing, the HS-RAs method gives a detailed causal analysis of human errors from receiving information to implement control actions. At last, the HS-RAs method is demonstrated using a case study of the 2011 Yong-Wen railway collision. A number of prominent accident causes of human factors are revealed and necessary countermeasures are proposed to avoid the recurrence of similar accidents. The HFACS-STAMP hybrid method has several advantages and can contribute to railway safety by providing a detailed analysis of the role of human error in railway accidents.

A systematic literature review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE			English	Review						Lean; Lean thinking; Lean interventions; quality improvement; healthcare	EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM; PATIENT SAFETY; 6 SIGMA; PRINCIPLES; IMPLEMENTATION; THINKING; REDUCE; EFFICIENCY; TRANSFORMATION	Lean is a widely used quality improvement methodology initially developed and used in the automotive and manufacturing industries but recently expanded to the healthcare sector. This systematic literature review seeks to independently assess the effect of Lean or Lean interventions on worker and patient satisfaction, health and process outcomes, and financial costs. We conducted a systematic literature review of Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, ABI/Inform, ERIC, EMBASE and SCOPUS. Peer reviewed articles were included if they examined a Lean intervention and included quantitative data. Methodological quality was assessed using validated critical appraisal checklists. Publically available data collected by the Saskatchewan Health Quality Council and the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses were also analysed and reported separately. Data on design, methods, interventions and key outcomes were extracted and collated. Our electronic search identified 22 articles that passed methodological quality review. Among the accepted studies, 4 were exclusively concerned with health outcomes, 3 included both health and process outcomes and 15 included process outcomes. Our study found that Lean interventions have: (i) no statistically significant association with patient satisfaction and health outcomes; (ii) a negative association with financial costs and worker satisfaction and (iii) potential, yet inconsistent, benefits on process outcomes like patient flow and safety. While some may strongly believe that Lean interventions lead to quality improvements in healthcare, the evidence to date simply does not support this claim. More rigorous, higher quality and better conducted scientific research is required to definitively ascertain the impact and effectiveness of Lean in healthcare settings.

The events were based on preschool science-related activities and the experimental pre-event involved predicting actions to occur during a target event, manipulating types of cues available to support these predictive inferences. Action prediction did improve free recall, and effects may have influenced attentional processes evoked by actions generated and enacted. Although children effectively used outcome cues to predict actions, a one-to-one relation between pre-event action prediction patterns and recall did not occur. In combination with other findings, this result may suggest that increased attention during the target event may have supported the pre-event effect rather than integration of information between the pre-event and target event. Early childhood teachers engaging children in science activities should provide explicit cues to enhance usefulness of preparatory activities for recall.

The rapid urbanization predicted for developing countries will cause serious water shortages in densely populated areas. The Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) is taking precautions by planning and developing their water supply infrastructure to ensure reliable supply of water. We used the five capitals model of sustainable livelihoods to capture how a household makes a living and analyzed the effects of five forms of capital (natural, physical, human, financial, and social) on water consumption behaviors from the perspective of the residents' livelihood. We conducted a survey to gain an understanding of the thought processes behind water consumption behavior in two villages in suburban Vientiane. The results indicated that natural and physical capital delayed connections to the water supply. Financial capital stimulated the purchase of high-quality water in preference to a connection to the water supply. This lack of connection is not necessarily sustainable in the near future, considering ongoing urbanization. Furthermore, this possibility presents a difficult problem, as residents do not usually acknowledge it. To accomplish sustainable development goals, this gap should be overcome.

J	Lin, ZC				Lin, Zu-Chun			Comparison of technology-based cooperative learning with technology-based individual learning in enhancing fundamental nursing proficiency	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Article						Cooperative learning; Technology; Critical thinking; Nursing skill; Nursing proficiency	SKILLS	Background: The aim of nursing education is to prepare students with critical thinking, high interests in profession and high proficiency in patient care. Cooperative learning promotes team work and encourages knowledge building upon discussion. It has been viewed as one of the most powerful learning methods. Technology has been considered an influential tool in teaching and learning. It assists students in gathering more information to solve the problems and master skills better. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of technology-based cooperative learning with technology-based individual learning in nursing students' critical thinking in catheterization knowledge gaining, error discovering, skill acquisitions, and overall scores. Methods: This study used a pretest-posttest experimental design. Ninety-eight students were assigned randomly to one of two groups. Questionnaires and tests were collected at baseline and after completion of intervention. Results: The results of this study showed that there was no significant difference in related catheterization skill performance. However, the remaining variables differed greatly between the two groups. Conclusions and applications: This study's findings guide the researchers and instructors to use technology-based cooperative learning more appropriately. Future research should address the design of the course module and the availability of mobile devices to-reach student-centered and learn on the move goals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessments which promote critical thinking necessary for sustained learning beyond university are highly valued. However, the design of assessment tasks to achieve these types of thinking skills and dispositions to act in professional practice has received little attention. This research examines how academics design assessment to achieve these learning goals in Indigenous health education. Indigenous health education is an important area of learning for health practitioners to help address worldwide patterns of health inequities that exist for Indigenous people. We used a constructivist qualitative methodology to (i) explore learning goals and assessment strategies used in Indigenous health tertiary education and (ii) examine how they relate to higher education assessment ideals. Forty-one academics (from nine health disciplines) involved in teaching Indigenous health content participated in a semi-structured interview. Thematic analysis revealed learning goals to transform students' perspectives and capacities to think critically and creatively about their role in Indigenous health. In contrast, assessment tasks encouraged more narrowly bounded thinking to analyse information about historical and socio-cultural factors contributing to Indigenous health. To transform students to be critical health practitioners capable of working and collaborating with Indigenous people to advance their health and well-being, the findings suggest that assessment may need to be nested across many aspects of the curriculum using a programmatic approach, and with a focus on learning to think and act for future practice. These findings accord with more recent calls for transformation of learning and assessment in health education.

Research on the cultural evolution of misbeliefs has demonstrated that a social context can explain what people think but not whether it also explains how people think. We shift the focus from the diffusion of false beliefs to the diffusion of suboptimal belief-formation strategies and identify a novel mechanism whereby misbeliefs arise and spread. We show that, when individual decision makers have access to the data-gathering behavior of others, the tendency to make decisions on the basis of insufficient evidence is amplified, increasing the rate of incorrect, costly decisions. We argue that this mechanism fills a gap in current explanations of problematic, widespread misbeliefs such as climate change denial.

Many people do not recognise withdrawal symptoms or understand how to minimise them while safely discontinuing antidepressants. To address the gaps, the authors developed the 'Redressing long-term antidepressant use' (RELEASE) resources, comprising a medicines information brochure, a decision aid, and drug- specific hyperbolic tapering protocols. Aim To explore patients' acceptability of the RELEASE resources to optimise their use and impact. Design and setting A think-aloud interview study among adults with lived experience of long-term antidepressant use conducted in south-east Queensland, Australia, between November 2021 and June 2022. Method Participants were purposively sampled from general practices and interviewed face-to-face or via videoconferencing. Participants verbalised their thoughts, impressions, and feelings while engaging with each resource. Interviews were analysed using a deductive coding framework, including codes related to acceptability and optimisation. Interviews were analysed in a series of four tranches, with iterative modifications made to resources after each tranche. Results Participants (n = 14) reported the resources to be relevant, informative, motivational, and usable. Participants' comments informed modifications, including changes to wording, content order, and layout. Several participants expressed frustration that they had not had these resources earlier, with one reporting the information could have been 'life changing'. Many commented on the need for these resources to be widely available to both patients and doctors. Conclusion The RELEASE resources were found to be acceptable, useful, and potentially life changing. The effectiveness of these consumer-informed resources in supporting safe cessation of long-term antidepressants is currently being tested in general practice.

We built cognitive simulation models to predict drivers' direction sign reading reaction time. Models were built using the queueing network-adaptive control of thought rational (QN-ACTR) cognitive architecture. Drivers' task-specific knowledge and skills were programmed as production rules. Two assumptions about drivers' strategies were proposed and tested. The models were connected to a driving simulator program to produce prediction of reaction time. Model results were compared to human results in sign reading single-task and reading while driving dual-task conditions. The models were built using existing modelling methods without adjusting any parameter to fit the human data. The models' prediction was similar to the human data and could capture the different reaction time in different task conditions with different numbers of road names on the direction signs. Root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.3 s, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 12%. The results demonstrated the models' predictive power. The models provide a useful tool for the prediction of driver performance and the evaluation of direction sign design.

Methods Forty adult participants were recruited from the general public using posters in pharmacies and a press article, and from a pool of volunteer simulated patients maintained by University of Nottingham medical and pharmacy schools. The participants, in seven groups that met at different times, were asked to 'think aloud,' as they were individually observed completing the reporting process for the paper and internet system, highlighting their thoughts and any issues encountered. They were asked to talk about their experience of reporting immediately after they had reported by telephone. Data from the field notes were analysed thematically and supplemented with relevant information from digital audio recordings. Conclusions Usability testing using the 'think aloud' approach worked well and identified areas of the Yellow Card reporting system which could be improved. Whilst the three methods of reporting available to the public are all reasonably 'fit for purpose', there were many suggestions identified for improving ease of completion and data quality, especially for the internet system. When systems for reporting of ADRs are designed, they should be tested by potential users before they are launched, so that potential problems are identified in advance.

Digital tools, multidisciplinarity and innovation for communicating vaccine safety in the COVID-19 era	HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS			English	Article						Vaccine communication; vaccine safety; innovation; human-centered design; social media listening; infodemic; vaccine safety net		The research on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and their commercialization is an opportunity to test and consolidate the current knowledge along with the diverse available tools related to vaccine communication. In this paper we explore the value of a multidisciplinary approach in this field: vaccine communication activities can be combined with insights from data science, risk communication, behavior change, design thinking and digital marketing. Methodologies derived from innovation and human-centered design can contribute to the development and testing of vaccine promotion campaigns, speeding up processes and streamlining the production of evidence in this area. The multiple activities involving the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could be the fertile ground in which to develop, test and refine effective frameworks to transfer data acquired through listening strategies into effective vaccine promotion campaigns. The World Health Organization's Vaccine Safety Net is an interesting example of trusted information sources that aim toward using digital tools and innovative methodologies for communicating science-based information on vaccine safety at the global level.

J	POWERS, JD				POWERS, JD			STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN PHARMACOKINETIC STUDY DESIGN	CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS			English	Review							EXTENDED LEAST-SQUARES; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; PARAMETRIC MODELS; POPULATION ANALYSIS; HALF-LIVES; REGRESSION; BIOAVAILABILITY; CONSTRUCTION; TRIALS; TESTS	Pharmacokinetic studies may generally be categorised into 3 types: (a) population-based investigations, (b) individual-based compartmental, or (c) individual-based noncompartmental research projects. Each type of study has advantages and limitations. Population-based investigations pool drug concentrations across more than 1 individual subject. From these data, estimates of pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated. NONMEM is the only computer program available to evaluate this type of information. Recently a method has been proposed which derives individual estimates from the information available from NONMEM. By combining these 2 procedures it is possible for the clinician to review and adjust the dosage regimen if necessary. Population-based studies require fewer design criteria than other methods and are adaptable to the clinical setting, i.e. subjects can be patients currently being treated with the drug under consideration. One distinct advantage to this type of study is the flexibility of sampling times and the capability of the clinician to use information from the critically ill, the geriatric patient or the very young child. These subjects would not be available for the individual-based type of study because of the relatively large number of samples needed. Individual-based pharmacokinetic studies can be divided into 2 types with respect to their evaluation: (a) compartmental and (b) noncompartmental investigations. The latter type of study was originally thought to require fewer assumptions than the former but subsequently it has been shown that noncompartmental analyses are more restrictive and are basically compartmental in their approach. These studies estimate parameters which the compartmental investigation does not usually consider. These include area under the moment curve (AUMC) and mean residence time (MRT). The individual-based compartmental approach to pharmacokinetics is best carried out in the laboratory setting. Estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated for each individual in the study. This requires obtaining many samples from each subject and hence is not suitable for the critically ill patient. Hypothesis testing and interval estimation are predicated on the underlying sampling distributions of the estimates. Without information regarding these distributions the investigator is advised to use the appropriate nonparametric statistical procedures.

Design and Implementation of Museum Educational Content Based on Mobile Augmented Reality	COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR); museum education content; abstraction hierarchy principle	SYSTEM	In the digital age, museums are becoming increasingly integrated with media technology. The interactive mode of museum education brought about by new digital communication technology can increase the audience's participation and interest in museum education content. This paper attempts to use Mobile Augment Reality (MAR) technology to design museum education content under the guidance of the principle of abstraction hierarchy from the theory of education optimization. With the help of MAR technology, museum education content can move up and down at different levels of information abstraction. The purpose is to help the audience move between perceptual knowledge and rational knowledge and improve their ability to understand. The evaluation results show that this style of interactive teaching content can promote visitors' understanding, thinking and interest in the cultural content of museum exhibits. It is also can helps visitors use a more professional-level vocabulary and more detailed descriptions about the cultural content of museum exhibits. The design and implementation method detailed in this paper has a certain guiding value for museum education development as well as utilization of MAR technology.

Group Decision-Making Based on the VIKOR Method with Trapezoidal Bipolar Fuzzy Information	SYMMETRY-BASEL			English	Article						trapezoidal bipolar fuzzy numbers; VIKOR; TOPSIS; entropy measure	COMPROMISE SOLUTION	The VIKOR methodology stands out as an important multi-criteria decision-making technique. VIKOR stands for "VIekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje", a Serbian term for "multi-criteria optimization and compromise solution". It has been adapted to sources of information with sundry formats. We contribute to that strand on literature with a design of a new multiple-attribute group decision-making method called the trapezoidal bipolar fuzzy VIKOR method. It consists of a suitable redesign of the VIKOR approach so that it can use information with bipolar configurations. Bipolar fuzzy sets (and numbers) establish a symmetrical trade-off between two judgmental constituents of human thinking. The agents acquire uncertain and vague information in the form of linguistic variables parameterized by trapezoidal bipolar fuzzy numbers. Trapezoidal bipolar fuzzy numbers are considered by decision-makers for assigning the preference information of alternatives with respect to different attributes. Our non-trivial adaptation necessitates several steps. The ranking function of bipolar fuzzy numbers is employed to make a simple decision matrix with real numbers as its entries. Shannon's entropy concept is applied to evaluate the normalized weights for attributes that may be either partially or completely unknown to the decision-makers. The ordering of the alternatives is obtained by assorting the maximum group utility and the individual regret of the opponent in an ascending manner. For illustration, the proposed technique is applied to two group decision-making problems, namely, the selection of waste treatment methods and the site to plant a thermal power station. A comparison of this method with the trapezoidal bipolar fuzzy TOPSIS method is also presented.

We discuss here what we think are the three main steps required to make experimental investigations of economic games as statistically informative as possible: finding the solution of the experimental game under the postulated equilibrium or other economic models, selecting from a potential class of experimental designs the optimal one for discriminating between those models, and choosing an optimal stopping rule that indicates when to stop sampling data and accept one model as the best explanation of the data. Each step can be computationally intensive. We offer an algorithmic presentation of the necessary computations in each of the three steps and illustrate these procedures by examples from our research on learning models in experimental games with incomplete information. These three steps of experimental design and analysis are not limited to experimental games, but the computational burden of implementing these algorithms in other experimental environments-for example, market experiments-requires further considerations with which we have not dealt.

J	Krumholz, HM				Krumholz, Harlan M.			The Time for Digital Health is Almost Here	YONSEI MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Digital health technology; data science; SaMD		We are now on the cusp of massive adoption of digital health technologies. Medicine is becoming an information science intertwined with technology and data science. This talk aims to describe the current state of digital transformation in healthcare, to identify reasons for enthusiasm and caution, and to provide a framework for thinking about what is necessary for hospitals and health systems to be confident about incorporating these innovations into practice. I have three key recommendations. First, we should buy results, not claims. Those in positions that influence decisions about endorsing or purchasing digital products designed to improve care or outcomes ought to buy results, not claims or intermediate results. Moreover, although analytic validity and clinical validity are important, they sometimes do not reflect the impact of a product in its entirety. Ultimately, we need to know whether patients benefit. Second, we should insist on transparency. The performance of a product cannot be a secret. The basis on which developers make claims about their products should be open to all, including patients. Better yet, data on which experts reach a conclusion should be shared, just as many companies share research data on drugs and devices. Third, we should be aware of unintended adverse consequences. We should evaluate every intervention for unintended adverse consequences. Changes to systems, with all good intentions, can always go awry. In conclusion, insistence on good and evolving evidence is the best way to arrive at our destination: the use of innovations to improve outcomes.

Small particles of plastic microplastics - are an increasing cause of concern because they can potentially cause a range of environmental problems for organisms and for the assemblages in which they live. Particles are a potential source of impacts in their own right, or as carriers of toxins that can then become absorbed into animals or plants. As a result, there has been increasing publication of programmes of sampling to quantify microplastics, to identify what types are where and to consider the extent to which they are causing impacts. Some of the sampling is to consider large-scale patterns. Some is to gather information about temporal trends. Regardless of the objectives, much of the sampling is not adequate to provide robust data to allow comparative assessments, examine trends or, in some cases, even to be sure about the quantities of plastic being encountered. The problems in such sampling programmes have been widely discussed in the ecological literature. Here, we attempt to identify some of the major problems and their causes and to promote thinking about the available solutions, in terms of improved sampling designs. This is done in the hope that more thought about the pitfalls will lead to more seeking of advice from statisticians and those who are expert in sampling, so that better information will become available in the future.

Antivaccine information on social media is a major barrier to addressing vaccine hesitancy. Understanding how vaccine proponents and opponents interact with each other on social media may help address vaccine hesitancy. Objective: We aimed to examine conversations between vaccine proponents and opponents on Reddit to understand whether homophily in web-based conversations impedes opinion exchange, whether people are able to accommodate their languages to each other in web-based conversations, and whether engaging with opposing viewpoints stimulates higher levels of analytical thinking. Methods: We analyzed large-scale conversational text data about human vaccines on Reddit from 2016 to 2018. Using deep neural network language models and computer-assisted conversational analyses, we obtained each Redditor's stance on vaccines, each post's stance on vaccines, each Redditor's language coordination score, and each post or comment's analytical thinking score. We then performed chi-square tests, 2-tailed t tests, and multilevel modeling to test 3 questions of interest. Results: The results show that both provaccine and antivaccine Redditors are more likely to selectively respond to Redditors who indicate similar views on vaccines (P<.001). When Redditors interact with others who hold opposing views on vaccines, both provaccine and antivaccine Redditors accommodate their language to out-group members (provaccine Redditors: P=.044; antivaccine Redditors: P=.047) and show no difference in analytical thinking compared with interacting with congruent views (P=.63), suggesting that Redditors do not engage in motivated reasoning. Antivaccine Redditors, on average, showed higher analytical thinking in their posts and comments than provaccine Redditors (P<.001). Conclusions: This study shows that although vaccine proponents and opponents selectively communicate with their in-group members on Reddit, they accommodate their language and do not engage in motivated reasoning when communicating with out-group members. These findings may have implications for the design of provaccine campaigns on social media.

J	Enas, GG; Andersen, JS				Enas, GG; Andersen, JS			Enhancing the value delivered by the statistician throughout drug discovery and development: putting statistical science into regulated pharmaceutical innovation	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Medical Statistics	JUL 28-30, 1999	DE MONTFORT UNIV, LEICESTER, ENGLAND		DE MONTFORT UNIV			With the dawn of the 21st century, the pharmaceutical industry faces a dramatically different constellation of business and scientific predictors of success than those of just a few years ago. Significant advances in science at the genetic, molecular and cellular levels, combined with progress demonstrated around the globe with drug regulations, have increased business and competitive opportunities. This has occurred in search of better and cheaper medicines that reach patients with unmet medical needs as quickly as possible. Herein lie new opportunities for those who can help business and regulatory leaders make good decisions about drug development and market authorization as quickly and efficiently as possible in the presence of uncertainty. The statistician is uniquely trained and qualified to render such value. We show how the statistician can contribute to the process of drug innovation from the very early stages of drug discovery until patients, payers and regulators are satisfied. Indeed, the very nature of regulated innovation demands that efficient and effective processes are implemented which yield the right information for good decision making. The statistician can take the lead in setting a strategy that directs such processes in the direction of greatest value. This demands skills that enable one to identify important sources of variability and uncertainty and then leverage those skills to make decisions. If such decisions call for more information, then the statistician can render experimental designs which generate the right information needed to make the decision in an efficient, timely manner. To add value to the enterprise, statisticians will have to become more intimately associated with business and regulatory decisions by building on their traditional roles (for example, numerical analyst, tactician) and unique skill sets (for example, analysis, computation, logical thought and work process, precision, accuracy). Business and regulatory savvy, coupled with excellent communication and interpersonal skills, will allow statisticians to help create the knowledge needed to drive success in the future.

J	Song, ZT; Zhu, JH				Song, Zhiting; Zhu, Jianhua			Blockchain for smart manufacturing systems: a survey	CHINESE MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Smart manufacturing systems; Blockchain; Complexity science	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; DIGITAL TWIN; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; INDUSTRY 4.0; TECHNOLOGY; ARCHITECTURE; LOGISTICS; INTERNET; FRAMEWORK; IOT	Purpose Smart manufacturing is the prime gripper for the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry. Smart manufacturing systems (SMSs) largely determine how smart manufacturing evolves in technical and organizational dimensions and how it realizes values in products, production or services. SMSs are growing rapidly and receiving tons of attention from academic research and industrial practice. However, the development of SMSs is still in its fancy, and many issues wait to be identified and solved, such as single point failures, low transparency and ineffective resource sharing. Blockchain, an emerging technology deriving from Bitcoin, is competent to aid SMSs to conquer troubles due to its decentralization, traceability, trackability, disintermediation, auditability and etc. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the blockchain applications in SMSs, seek out the challenges faced by blockchain-enabled SMSs (BSMSs) and provide referable research directions and ideas. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review as a survey is conducted in this paper. The survey starts by introducing blockchain concepts, followed by the descriptions of a literature review method and the blockchain applications throughout the product life cycle in SMSs. Then, the key issues and challenges confronting BSMSs are discussed and some possible research directions are also proposed. It finally presents qualitative and quantitative descriptions of BSMSs, along with some conclusions and implications. Findings The findings of this paper present a deep understanding about the current status and challenges of blockchain adoption in SMSs. Furthermore, this paper provides a brand new thinking for future research.

J	Krichmar, JL				Krichmar, Jeffrey L.			Design principles for biologically inspired cognitive robotics	BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURES			English	Article						Cognition; Computational neuroscience; Embodiment; Neurorobots	MAZE NAVIGATION; BRAIN; NEUROMODULATION; CATEGORIZATION; INTEGRATION; RESPONSES; BEHAVIOR; MODEL	The goals of cognitive robotics are to better understand cognition through the construction of physical artifacts, and to create practical systems that demonstrate cognitive capabilities. I believe for cognitive robotics to move forward, a balanced approach that emphasizes the interaction of brain, body, and environment is necessary. In general, cognitive robots and cognitive architectures focus too much on brain control, and overlook the contributions of morphology to intelligent behavior. On the other hand, the behavior based robotics approach is unbalanced in the opposite direction. For cognitive robotics to move forward, these disparate research communities need to come into balance. The materials, morphology, sensors, actuators, and the nervous system should be balanced and coordinated in their action. In their book, "How the body shapes the way we think: A new view of intelligence" (MIT Press, 2007), Pfeifer and Bongard have suggested that intelligent agents should follow a set of design principles that highlight the importance of embodiment and physical interaction with the environment. In the present paper, I apply each of these principles to biologically inspired cognitive robotics and suggest how the field can shift toward better cognitive architectures by adherence to these principles.

This study aims to understand preferences of physical activity text messages (SMS), sequentially develop prototype SMS, and determine preferred dose of SMS to inform a future study utilizing Text4baby. This study had a user-centered design with three phases: (1) literature review and interviews with pregnant women for development of prototype SMS, (2) interviews with health care professionals and pregnant women for prototype SMS feedback, and (3) survey to determine preferred dose of SMS. Data from interviews identified knowledge and support as major themes. Prototypes were developed (N= 14) and informed 168 SMS. Pregnant women (N= 326) thought three SMS/week were about right (50.2 %) and preferred three SMS/week throughout pregnancy (71.9 %). There is a need for opportunities for behavioral scientists to incorporate evidence-based practices within scalable interventions. As such, this research will inform utilization of Text4baby to potentially improve physical activity participation.

The analysis was based on previous categories: source-problem, paper focus, subjects/area of knowledge, target groups, GC contents, type of approach and purpose(s) of the proposal. A list of possible characteristics of each category served as an example to compare with the information resulting from the analyses, and thus improve the discussions. In 127 papers, GC and its teaching were associated, albeit generally, with the theme of sustainability/sustainable development, which points to its potential to face environment-related aspects of chemistry in teaching. A systemic vision in the interconnection between GC and sustainability/sustainable development appeared more explicitly in 39 papers up to 2019. So far, the analysis highlights a certain reproduction of traditional chemistry teaching, and little evidence of the particularities of GC teaching. Despite the intention of inserting GC into chemistry teaching, proposals for its incorporation are often made superficially, more as an addendum or an extra quality than a specific goal. More methodological detail of the experiments carried out is needed to help in the dissemination of GC in the training curriculum of chemists. The discussions and reports on teaching approaches based on Systems Thinking showed the opening of a promising new methodological challenge within this theoretical paradigm.

In this new setup, mapping multiple applications on available computational resources leads to interaction and contention at various network resources. Consequently, taking into account the traffic characteristics becomes of crucial importance for performance analysis and optimization of the communication infrastructure, as well as proper resource management. Although queuing-based approaches have been traditionally used for performance analysis purposes, they cannot properly account for many of the traffic characteristics (e. g., non-stationarity, self-similarity) that are crucial for multicore platform design. To overcome these limitations, we propose a statistical physics inspired approach to capture the traffic dynamics in multicore systems. As shown later in this paper, this is of fundamental significance for re-thinking the very basis of multicore systems design; it also opens up new research directions into NoC optimization which require accurate models of time-dependent and space-dependent traffic behavior.

Incorporating Student Design in an HPLC Lab Activity Student Metacognition and Argumentation	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Upper-Division Undergraduate; Laboratory Instruction; Analytical Chemistry; Inquiry-Based/Discovery Learning; Internet/Web-Based Learning; Problem Solving/Decision Making; Drugs/Pharmaceuticals; Forensic:Chemistry; HPLC	CHEMISTRY; BIOCHEMISTRY; EDUCATION	The techniques learned in a laboratory translate into strong critical thinking aptitudes as well as adeptness in complex problem-solving within research. Typically; these laboratory skills are not acquired until a budding scientist enters graduate school since many undergraduate laboratories are more procedural than investigative. Therefore, the module in discussion was designed to aid students in developing competence toward thinking like a scientist. Through utilization of an inquiry-based approach, a laboratory involving high performance liquid chromatography was transformed into a blended online learning experiment. While students were provided in-class time to interact with their peers and the instructor and TA, the majority of the work and. development was done outside of class. All background information and protocols were provided outside of the lab via an online course management system including the PowerPoint videos that students used to prepare for the experiment. The students used those materials to ultimately determine the identity and number of different steroids in an unknown sample. The objective was to determine if this approach promoted the metacognitive skills of students and encourage the use of argumentative skills when presenting and justifying claims and data.

To facilitate strategic thinking, we design a 'structured' environment where subjects first assign subjective values to the payoff pairs and state their beliefs about their counterparts' probable strategies, before selecting their own strategies in light of those deliberations. Our results show that a majority of strategy choices are inconsistent with the equilibrium prediction, and that only just over half of strategy choices constitute best responses to subjects' stated beliefs. Allowing for other-regarding considerations increases best responding significantly, but the increase is rather small. We further compare patterns of strategies with those made in an 'unstructured' environment in which subjects are not specifically directed to think strategically. Our data suggest that structuring the pre-decision deliberation process does not affect strategic sophistication.

Human-Centered Design of a Clinical Decision Support for Anemia Screening in Children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease	APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						clinical decision support systems; usability testing; human-centered decision; clinical workflows	HEALTH-CARE; ULCERATIVE-COLITIS; IRON-DEFICIENCY; CROHNS-DISEASE; THINK-ALOUD; USABILITY; PREVALENCE; IMPROVE; MANAGEMENT; GUIDELINE	Background Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) commonly leads to iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Rates of screening and treatment of IDA are often low. A clinical decision support system (CDSS) embedded in an electronic health record could improve adherence to evidence-based care. Rates of CDSS adoption are often low due to poor usability and fit with work processes. One solution is to use human-centered design (HCD), which designs CDSS based on identified user needs and context of use and evaluates prototypes for usefulness and usability.Objectives this study aimed to use HCD to design a CDSS tool called the IBD Anemia Diagnosis Tool, IADx.Methods Interviews with IBD practitioners informed creation of a process map of anemia care that was used by an interdisciplinary team that used HCD principles to create a prototype CDSS. The prototype was iteratively tested with "Think Aloud" usability evaluation with clinicians as well as semi-structured interviews, a survey, and observations. Feedback was coded and informed redesign.Results Process mapping showed that IADx should function at in-person encounters and asynchronous laboratory review. Clinicians desired full automation of clinical information acquisition such as laboratory trends and analysis such as calculation of iron deficit, less automation of clinical decision selection such as laboratory ordering, and no automation of action implementation such as signing medication orders. Providers preferred an interruptive alert over a noninterruptive reminder.Conclusion Providers preferred an interruptive alert, perhaps due to the low likelihood of noticing a noninterruptive advisory. High levels of desire for automation of information acquisition and analysis with less automation of decision selection and action may be generalizable to other CDSSs designed for chronic disease management. This underlines the ways in which CDSSs have the potential to augment rather than replace provider cognitive work.

J	Pande, P				Pande, Prajakt			Learning and expertise with scientific external representations: an embodied and extended cognition model	PHENOMENOLOGY AND THE COGNITIVE SCIENCES			English	Article						Representation; Embodied; Science education; Mathematics education; Expertise; Mental abacus	MENTAL CALCULATION; ABACUS; INTEGRATION; THINKING; SCIENCE; PERCEPTION; MULTIMEDIA; EQUATIONS; FEATURES; TOOL	This paper takes an embodied and extended cognition perspective to ER integration - a cognitive process through which a learner integrates external representations (ERs) in a domain, with her internal (mental) model, as she interacts with, uses, understands and transforms between those ERs. In the paper, I argue for a theoretical as well as empirical shift in future investigations of ER integration, by proposing a model of cognitive mechanisms underlying the process, based on recent advances in extended and embodied cognition. I present this new model in contrast to the still dominant classical cognitivist (information processing) approaches to ER integration, and the educational technology intervention designs such approaches inspire. I then exemplify this distinction between the information processing model and the new model through a case of arithmetic problem solving. Corroborative neuroscience evidence presented in relation to this case provides empirical support for the new model by showing how bodily actions (sensorimotor mechanisms) are critical to ER integration and learning. Finally, as educational implications of the new model, I demonstrate the need for: (i) re-viewing the development of ER integration and expertise as fine-tuning of the learner's action or sensorimotor system, and (ii) a shift of focus in new-media intervention design principles based on this newer understanding of ER integration in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

Furthermore, while a similar avatar promotes users to regulate their behaviors and achieve better performance in a procedural task, high similarity also inhibits users' creativity by invoking habitual thinking, resulting in worse performance in generating original ideas in a creative task.Originality/valueThis study is expected to contribute to the information systems literature by revealing the value of avatar design and providing new perspectives on improving users' experiences in the Metaverse.

Leveraging external data in the design and analysis of clinical trials in neuro-oncology	LANCET ONCOLOGY			English	Article							HISTORICAL CONTROL DATA; REAL-WORLD EVIDENCE; SINGLE-ARM; ADJUVANT PACLITAXEL; ADJUSTMENT; SURVIVAL; RANDOMIZATION; TEMOZOLOMIDE; TRASTUZUMAB; BEVACIZUMAB	Integration of external control data, with patient-level information, in clinical trials has the potential to accelerate the development of new treatments in neuro-oncology by contextualising single-arm studies and improving decision making (eg, early stopping decisions). Based on a series of presentations at the 2020 Clinical Trials Think Tank hosted by the Society of Neuro-Oncology, we provide an overview on the use of external control data representative of the standard of care in the design and analysis of clinical trials. High-quality patient-level records, rigorous methods, and validation analyses are necessary to effectively leverage external data. We review study designs, statistical methods, risks, and potential distortions in using external data from completed trials and real-world data, as well as data sources, data sharing models, ongoing work, and applications in glioblastoma.

By means of a theoretical synthesis of previous works, the present work starts with an epistemological discussion focused on systems thinking. With the organization in focus, an extrospective approach is taken in which a global discussion results in some implications for the organizational system design. This system is considered as a sociotechnological system; consequently, the nature of systems (i.e., complexity) and the nature of human beings (i.e., parts of the systems and who are to be served by the artifacts) are discussed. The result argues that intelligent artifacts can extend the intelligent behavior of organizations. Examples of computer system architecture and software architecture are given.

Intracellular selection of peptide inhibitors that target disulphide-bridged Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers	PROTEIN SCIENCE			English	Article						amyloid; protein misfolding; protein-protein interactions; library screening; protein-fragment complementation assay; Alzheimer's disease	AMYLOID-BETA-PEPTIDE; PROTEIN-FRAGMENT COMPLEMENTATION; SOLID-STATE NMR; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; INTERACTING PEPTIDES; AGGREGATION; PREDICTION; TOXICITY; MODEL; NEUROTOXICITY	The beta-amyloid (A beta) peptide aggregates into a number of soluble and insoluble forms, with soluble oligomers thought to be the primary factor implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathology. As a result, a wide range of potential aggregation inhibitors have been developed. However, in addition to problems with solubility and protease susceptibility, many have inadvertently raised the concentration of these soluble neurotoxic species. Sandberg et al. previously reported a beta-hairpin stabilized variant of A beta(42) that results from an intramolecular disulphide bridge (A21C/A31C; A beta(42cc)), which generates highly toxic oligomeric species incapable of converting into mature fibrils. Using an intracellular protein-fragment complementation (PCA) approach, we have screened peptide libraries using E. coli that harbor an oxidizing environment to permit cytoplasmic disulphide bond formation. Peptides designed to target either the first or second beta-strand have been demonstrated to bind to A beta(42cc), lower amyloid cytotoxicity, and confer bacterial cell survival. Peptides have consequently been tested using wild-type A beta(42) via ThT binding assays, circular dichroism, MTT cytotoxicity assays, fluorescence microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Results demonstrate that amyloid-PCA selected peptides function by both removing amyloid oligomers as well as inhibiting their formation. These data further support the use of semirational design combined with intracellular PCA methodology to develop A beta antagonists as candidates for modification into drugs capable of slowing or even preventing the onset of AD.

The patient's view on rare disease trial design - a qualitative study	ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES			English	Article						Rare diseases; Patient involvement; Qualitative study	INVOLVEMENT; HEMOPHILIA; BARRIERS; CARE	BackgroundClinical trials in rare diseases are more challenging than trials in frequent diseases. Small numbers of eligible trial participants, often complicated by heterogeneity among rare disease patients, hamper the design and conduct of a classical' Randomized Controlled Trial. Therefore, novel designs are developed by statisticians. However, it is important to be aware of possible design aspects that may jeopardize the feasibility of trial conduct. If the burden of participation is considered out of proportion by patients or parents, recruitment may fail or participants may drop out before trial completion. In order to maximize the chance of success of trials in small populations, it is important to know which aspects of trial design are considered important by patients.ResultsWe have interviewed all ten members of the Patient Think Tank (PTT) of the ASTERIX project, a European research consortium on methodology for clinical trials in small populations. The PTT members are rare disease patient representatives who have completed extensive training in clinical trial methodology. We have analyzed the interviews qualitatively according to Grounded Theory using a thematic analysis, and we structured the topics in four chronologically ordered themes: 1. Involvement in trial design; 2. Opinions on trial design; 3. Trial participation; 4. Phase after the trial. Our main findings are that the PTT-members recommend that patients are involved in trial design from an early stage on, and have influence on the outcomes and measurement instruments that are chosen in the trial, the length of the study, the choice of participants, and the information that is sent to potential participants. Also, according to the PTT-members, patient groups should consider setting up disease registries, placebo groups should be minimized, and more education on clinical trials is advised.ConclusionsRare disease patient representatives who have been educated about clinical trial methodology think it is important to involve patient representatives in research at an early stage. They can be of advice in trial design in such a way that the ratio of potential benefit and burden of trial participation as well as the chosen outcome measures and in- and exclusion criteria are optimized.

One challenge is to identify mechanisms underlying reasoning in experiments. Here, we provide a way to design such tests in non-human animals. We know from research in skill acquisition in humans that reasoning and thinking can take time because some problems are processed in multiple steps before a solution is reached (e.g., during mental arithmetics). If animals are able to learn through similar processes their decision making can be time consuming, and most importantly improve if more time to process information is allowed. We tested if performance of two Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) increased in a two- choice experiment when they were allowed extra time before making their decisions, compared to when they were forced to decide immediately. We found that the performance of the orangutans did not depend on the time they were allowed to process the information before making their decisions. This methodology provides a potential avenue for empirical tests of mechanisms underlying reasoning in non-human animals.

Geodesign applies systems thinking to such problems using a dynamic and collaborative process wherein iteration is necessary to address diverse objectives. Preparation and execution of a two-day research workshop explored two aspects of geodesign dynamics using a new software platform called GeodesignHub.com. One aspect of dynamics concerned the cross-systems influence of proposed projects and policies as related to ten systems (e.g. transportation, housing, surface water, forest preserves etc.) influencing watershed sustainability in King County, Washington. A second aspect investigated the interaction among six multi-disciplinary design teams and each pursuing different considerations in decision workflow processes. A decision workflow called the Steinitz Geodesign Framework was scoped, designed, and implemented to address meaningful and substantive policy and project proposals for achieving consensus on a 40-year plan design. Workshop participants addressed targets among ten subsystems for sustainable urban development. Findings suggest the software provided support for high-performance collaboration when teams moved toward their targets and when negotiating to achieve a single plan outcome, but the urban growth areas and or housing densities established through policy are likely in need of reconsideration to accommodate population growth. Conclusions about findings and prospects for future research are provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In contrast to previous work on this topic, we pursue good prior-free auctions with non-identical bidders. Prior-free auctions can approximate meaningful benchmarks for non-identical bidders only when sufficient qualitative information about the bidder asymmetry is publicly known. We consider digital goods auctions where there is a total ordering of the bidders that is known to the seller, where earlier bidders are in some sense thought to have higher valuations. We use the framework of Hartline and Roughgarden (STOC'08) to define an appropriate revenue benchmark: the maximum revenue that can be obtained from a bid vector using prices that are nonincreasing in the bidder ordering and bounded above by the second-highest bid. This monotone-price benchmark is always as large as the well-known fixed-price benchmark F-(2), so designing prior-free auctions with good approximation guarantees is only harder. By design, an auction that approximates the monotone-price benchmark satisfies a very strong guarantee: it is, in particular, simultaneously near-optimal for essentially every Bayesian environment in which bidders' valuation distributions have nonincreasing monopoly prices, or in which the distribution of each bidder stochastically dominates that of the next. Even when there is no distribution over bidders' valuations, such an auction still provides a quantifiable input-by-input performance guarantee. In this paper, we design a simple O(1)-competitive prior-free auction for digital goods with ordered bidders. We also extend the monotone-price benchmark and our O(1)-competitive prior-free auction to multi-unit settings with limited supply. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An efficient DFD technique provides the disassembling and recycling easily. However, the recent trends of disassembling and recycling are to consider the aspects of environmental and social sustainability. Due to shortage of energy and deterioration of the ecological environment, the sustainable production is an active research topic to use the economic and social benefits as the evaluation standard of a design scheme as well as its environmental characteristics. This paper provides a new approach for DFD based on sustainability. In this regard, a hybrid multi-attribute decision making (MADM) method integrating the regret theory (RT) and the entropy weighting method is firstly developed. To implement the proposed approach, an eight-criterion evaluation system of schemes based on sustainability including the factors of disassembly energy consumption, disassembly accessibility, fastener ratio, toxic material proportion, material recovery rate, disassembly expense, production and use noise, and waste emissions, is established. To better describe the fuzziness of human thinking and to avoid information loss/distortion during information aggregation phases, the evaluation information given by experts is presented by our proposed interval 2-tuple linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (I2LIFNs). The weight vector of index structure is determined by the entropy weighting method under the fuzzy environment. The RT is employed to get the final order of alternatives by considering and quantitating both the risk attitude and the regret attitude of experts. To show the applicability of this study, a case study including four kinds of refrigerator schemes, is conducted to validate the proposed method. An extensive comparison with other recent and state of the art methods along with a sensitivity analysis of 13 experiments, is executed to verify effectiveness and reliability of the proposed I2LI-RT method. Finally, the experimental results show that: 1) disassembly accessibility (C-2), fastener ratio (C-3), waste emissions (C-8) and disassembly energy consumption (C-1) have a large impact on the scheme selection of DFD based on sustainability as those attributes carry relatively the larger weights; 2) our proposed method outperforms other recent and state of the art methods and 3) the chosen scheme A(1) is the winner in the majority of the sensitivity analysis cases (10 out of 13). At last but not least, the main finding is to furnish a systematic and efficient decision support tool for sustainable performance evaluation of product schemes of DFD. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Foods purchased influence the availability of foods in the home environment, and availability of foods in the home environment is associated with dietary intake. Objective To identify what factors influence food purchasing decisions of low-income parents while food shopping. Design A qualitative study using think-aloud methodology, the processing of information through verbalization concurrent with task performance, was used to verbally capture real-time decision making. Participants and setting Twenty-eight parents with a preschool-aged child enrolled in Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Study visits took place at the WIC clinic office and local grocery stores. Main outcomes Reasons for making decisions while food shopping. Analysis Audio recordings were transcribed, and thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize demographics and shopping behaviors. Results A parent's decision in a food purchase was based on child preference, value, need of an item, or the parent choice for a product. In addition, themes emerged related to participant shopping behavior included the influence of participation in WIC on food and beverage purchases, multiple trips to the store, and a frequent focus on purchasing bottled water and juice. The average shopping trip was 31.5 +/- 15.7 minutes, and the median amount spent was $38.61. Conclusion Understanding the influences of parent decisions while making food purchases can better help inform the nutrition education provided as part of WIC.

To gain an understanding of how children's nurses make clinical decisions. Background. Several studies have explored how nurses make clinical decisions and the factors that may affect the decision-making strategies used. However, the results of these studies are contradictory. Further, little is known about children's nurses' decision-making strategies. Design. The think aloud technique. Methods. Nurses (n = 12) from three surgical wards and nurses (n = 15) from three medical wards in a Scottish children's hospital were presented with clinical scenarios and asked to think aloud. The verbal protocols were analysed to provide an indication of how children's nurses made decisions. Whether there were any differences in decision-making between experienced and less experienced nurses and between graduates and non-graduates was also explored. Results. Analysis of verbal protocols obtained using the think aloud technique suggested that all the nurses in the sample used a hypothetico-deductive (analytical) model of decision-making. Further, all participants appeared to use backward reasoning strategies regardless of their level of expertise. This is a characteristic of non-expert decision-making. Experienced and less experienced nurses collected similar additional information before planning nursing interventions, supporting the conjecture that they were functioning at a non-expert level in relation to decision-making. No differences were seen in the information collected by graduate and non-graduate nurses. Conclusions. The decision-making strategies of children's nurses need exploring further and further research is needed to identify factors that may affect decision-making strategies. Several strategies to support nurses' clinical decision-making have been proposed but need testing to ascertain their effectiveness. Relevance to clinical practice. In clinical practice nurses make numerous decisions throughout the course of a shift. Sub-optimal decision-making strategies may adversely affect the quality of nursing care provided. It is imperative, therefore, to ascertain how nurses make clinical decisions and the factors that may influence the decision-making strategies used.

It is therefore unsurprising that covalent fragment-based approaches have become popular and have recently led to the identification of novel targets and binding sites, as well as ligands for targets previously thought to be 'undruggable'. Understanding the properties of such covalent fragments is important, and characterizing and/or predicting reactivity can be highly useful. This review aims to discuss the requirements for an electrophilic fragment library and the importance of differing warhead reactivity. Successful case studies from the world of drug discovery are then be examined.

Objectives We explored the factors that affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL), particularly positive thinking, of prostate cancer patients who receive ADT. Methods A cross-sectional design was used. A total of 132 prostate cancer patients, drawn from outpatient clinics of 2 medical centers, who were receiving ADT were included. Structured questionnaires, including a basic information sheet, the Positive Thinking Scale, Social Support Scale, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), were used for data collection. Statistical analysis was performed by using independent-sample t tests, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression. Results Prostate cancer patients who were receiving ADT were more likely to engage in positive thinking, which was correlated with better social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, prostate cancer concern, and a higher score on the FACT-P. Improved self-reported health status was correlated better with all subdimensions of HRQoL and better scores on the FACT-P. Greater social support was correlated with high social/family well-being. Conclusions Positive thinking, self-reported health status, and social support are important associated factors of HRQoL in prostate cancer patients who receive ADT. Implications for Practice Oncology nurses can improve HRQoL by improving positive thinking, self-reported health status, and social support of prostate cancer patients who receive ADT.

Given the wide range of diseases that these species might have, ensuring that the animals' health status is appropriate can be complex and challenging. The Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations has previously published recommendations for the health monitoring of experimental colonies of pigs (1998) and, respectively, calves, sheep and goats (2000). Unfortunately, the uptake of those recommendations was poor and insufficiently reported in scientific publications. These new recommendations for best practice focus on the main species of ruminants (cattle, sheep and goats) and pigs. They provide general and specific information helpful for designing a health management programme for the suppliers and for the user establishments, as well as guidance on animal procurement. Critical thinking based on the fields of use of the animals is promoted, aiming to help in taking informed decisions rather than establishing an exhaustive exclusion list for pathogens. Implementing the best health and welfare management practices should be done under the guidance of a competent attending veterinarian, with expertise and sufficient authority to take the appropriate action, doubled by excellent communication skills. It is strongly recommended that the user establishment's veterinarian works in close collaboration with the supplier's veterinarian.

This discipline, based on graphical user interfaces with pointing devices, became possible as software matured, hardware sped up, and screen resolution improved. Driven by the concepts of direct manipulation and dynamic queries, we made interactive interfaces that empowered users and opened up new possibilities for the next generation of designers. We worked with professionals who had real problems and tested real users to get their feedback. Some projects failed and some papers never got published, but many of the new ideas found their way into widely used commercial products. Our great satisfaction is that our students have spread the community spirit of the Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory as they continue to make further contributions.

Jointly thinking the post-dam future: exchange of local and scientific knowledge on the lakes of the Lower Rufiji, Tanzania	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES			English	Article						Stiegler's Gorge Dam; lakes; participatory science; environmental flows; climate change; Rufiji River; Tanzania	RIVER-BASIN; RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; HYDROPOWER PROJECT; FOREST MANAGEMENT; STIEGLERS GORGE; AFRICA; BIODIVERSITY; FLOODS; DECENTRALIZATION; LIVELIHOODS	A large dam is planned at Stiegler's Gorge in Tanzania. The change in the Rufiji River flood pattern will affect downstream ecosystems. This paper concentrates on the highly productive floodplain lakes that play a vital role in local livelihoods. A participatory monitoring system with village-based observers collected water level, rainfall, fisheries and food data from 2001 to 2011. Water balances of the lakes show dependence on the Rufiji River flood, with varying vulnerability. With the dam design flood of 2500 m(3) s(-1), lakes with a high threshold and small catchment will dry out quickly. Lakes with a lower threshold and substantial catchment are more robust but may still dry out during prolonged local drought. Analysis of rainfall (1923-2012) indicates a recent decrease. The data were analysed through feedback workshops with local observers, government technical staff and researchers. Through this collaborative approach, local capacity in preparing for the post-dam future was enhanced.	[Duvail, S.] Natl Museums Kenya, Inst Dev Res, UMR 208, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Mwakalinga, A.

Modelling and simulation: The basis for education enrichment and software design	ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								As the internet continually eliminates geographic boundaries, the concept of doing business within a single country is giving way to companies focusing on competing in an international marketplace. As modelling and simulation professionals, we have the most unique opportunities to become true global visionaries and be highly effective in providing fundamental opportunities that all our employers expect from our students. The future of the various professions in the information technology (IT) business relies greatly on innovative modelling and simulation practices that not merely enhance our ability to graduate good application programmers - these skills have now become commodities that can be either outsourced or automated. We are now more able to graduate students who are comfortable with the theory, build their higher-order thinking (HOT) skills and blend these with the necessary practice through the understanding of business and cultural issues involved; while being able to effectively share, communicate, articulate and advance their ideas for innovative products and solutions. Since good educational preparation is one of the primary means for us to prepare our future workforce; modelling and simulation as an oft-repeated, practice-driven learnt skill can help our students gain the necessary HOT skills to compete globally for highly skilled technology based jobs. We focus in this paper on the models and provide a model for educational innovation using modelling and simulation as a vehicle for software development. We illustrate this with a simple example of designing well co-ordinated software systems. Using a simple Petri net based-approach we develop a model-based, co-ordination-focused, requirements-driven guidelines for co-ordinated software design and testing.

Thirty-five patients (28 men, 7 women) and 29 spouses (5 men, 24 women) responded to survey items designed to investigate how subjects perceived themselves dealing with the cardiac diet, what questions they were asking, and how answers to those questions would help them. Subjects in the patient group (which was 80% male) most frequently asked questions dealing with compliance and the diet's benefits. Subjects in the spouse group (which was 83% female) most frequently asked questions relating to food selection. Participants indicated that having their questions answered would help them make decisions, be motivated, feel in control, and plan. Participants' overall attitude toward the diet was positive because patients were willing to make changes in their diet; however, more than half the sample thought food labels were difficult to understand and grocery shopping was difficult. We conclude that nutrition education programs that address individual needs and uses for nutrition information could enhance the learning process in group settings such as cardiac rehabilitation programs.

The realization of practical optical structures and devices is a complex problem due to the multitude of constraints on their optical performance, materials, scalability, and experimental tolerances, all of which are requirements implying large optimization spaces. However, despite the complexity of the process, to date, almost all nanophotonic structures are designed either intuitively or based on a priori selected topologies, and by adjusting a limited number of parameters. These intuition-based models are limited to ad hoc needs and have narrow applicability and predictive power, with the exhaustive parameter searches often performed manually. Since the comprehensive search in hyper-dimensional design space is highly resource-heavy, multi-objective optimization has so far been almost impossible. Humans' restrained capacity to think hyper-dimensionally also limits the perception of multivariate optimization models, and, therefore, advanced machinery is needed to manage the multi-domain, hyper-dimensional design parameter space. In this work, we merge the topology optimization method with deep learning algorithms, such as adversarial autoencoders, and show substantial improvement of the optimization process in terms of computational time (4900 times faster) and final devices efficiencies (similar to 98%) by providing unparalleled control of the compact design space representations. By enabling efficient, global optimization searches within complex landscapes, the proposed compact hyperparametric representations could become crucial for multi-constrained problems. The proposed approach could enable a much broader scope of the optimal designs and data-driven materials synthesis that goes beyond photonic and optoelectronic applications.

J	Barker, A				Barker, Andrew			Navigating Life: A Taxonomy of Wayfinding Behaviours	JOURNAL OF NAVIGATION			English	Article						Wayfinding; Navigation; Behavioural science; Human factors	ORIENTATION; INFORMATION	This paper presents a taxonomy of human wayfinding behaviours. For the purposes of this paper, wayfinding is purposeful navigating in everyday life, in man-made environments, traversing an environment or aiming for an objective with which the individual is unfamiliar. The taxonomy is developed through a review of wayfinding literature from research and practice, user studies conducted specifically for this research and a process of thinking by designing. This taxonomy can also be applied to navigating in documents printed on paper and on-screen, but this paper concentrates on behaviours in environmental space. This taxonomy creates twelve categories of behaviour differentiated by the characteristics of the information that they use. The categories of behaviour are also separated into three groups: social, semantic and spatial. This paper briefly describes and gives examples of each of the categories of behaviour. This is followed by insights into the behaviours from user studies conducted by the author. (This paper borrows its title from Cohen, 2015).

Furthermore, mass customization and the increasing usage of AI even in manual assembly offers new opportunities as well as it creates new challenges. OBJECTIVE: The trend towards mass customization in turn leads to increased complexity in production, which results in additional mental workload. This effect will continue in the foreseeable future. METHOD: Especially for small and medium sized companies, the backbone of Germany's economy, automatization and Human-Robot-Collaboration will take time to develop. Information assistance systems are and will be a bridging technology to help organizations to manage increasing complexity and the mental workload of their employees to not only boost productivity but also keep their workforce healthy. The ongoing demographic change further underlines the need to use information assistance systems to compensate possible age-associated deficits, but also keep older employees committed to their work and avoid effects of disengagement or disenfranchisement through participatory ergonomics. RESULTS: Information assistance systems can only develop their inherent potential if they are designed to support employees of varying age, competence levels, and affinity for technology. Participatory development and early engagement are key factors for an increased acceptance and usage of the systems as well as the individualization to make it suitable for each individual employee. CONCLUSION: Expanding the functionalities to an adaptive assistance system, using physiological correlates of mental workload as an input, is conceivable in the future.

Access to current, varied and authentic informational texts improves learning outcomes for K-12 students, but many teachers lack resources to expand and update readings. The Web offers freely available resources, but finding suitable ones is time-consuming. This research lays the groundwork for building tools to ease that burden. Design/methodology/approach This paper reports qualitative findings from a study in two stages: (1) a set of semistructured interviews, based on the critical incident technique, eliciting teachers' information-seeking practices and challenges; and (2) observations of teachers using a prototype teaching-oriented news search tool under a think-aloud protocol. Findings Teachers articulated different objectives and ways of using readings in their classrooms, goals and self-reported practices varied by experience level. Teachers struggled to formulate queries that are likely to return readings on specific course topics, instead searching directly for abstract topics. Experience differences did not translate into observable differences in search skill or success in the lab study. Originality/value There is limited work on teachers' information-seeking practices, particularly on how teachers look for texts for classroom use. This paper describes how teachers look for information in this context, setting the stage for future development and research on how to support this use case. Understanding and supporting teachers looking for information is a rich area for future research, due to the complexity of the information need and the fact that teachers are not looking for information for themselves.

A Private Speech Questionnaire including questions about seven different conditions, that is, spiritual thinking (e.g., praying, meditating), dreaming, thinking, problem-solving, recalling past events, recalling information, and dealing with stress, was designed. Furthermore, the sample was divided into two subgroups: born in the United States (simultaneous bilinguals) and born outside the United States but arriving to the country before the age of 10 (early successive bilinguals). In both groups and for all the seven conditions, English was more frequently used in private speech, and English was also the dominant language in our participants. Early bilinguals, however, more frequently used Spanish in different private speech situations. These findings suggest that the linguistic environment during early life has a significant impact on the language selected in different internal language situations, but the dominant language is more frequently used in private speech conditions.

Planning, implementation, and evaluation of multicomponent, case-based learning for first-year Indian medical undergraduates	ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						active learning; concept map; critical thinking; gastrointestinal system; physiology	EDUCATION; PHYSIOLOGY; STUDENTS; PATIENT; RETENTION; PATHOLOGY; HEALTH; INVOLVEMENT; TEACHERS; LECTURES	Didactic lecture is an effective method to quickly pass on a high volume of information to a large number of students. However, if not well designed, lectures can be monotonous and provide only passive learning, with little scope for higher order learning skills. To address this drawback of lectures, we supplemented it with case-based learning (CBL), which has been shown to promote self-learning. After giving an overview of gastrointestinal physiology through lectures, CBI, on peptic ulcer disease was implemented for first-year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery students. The present study aimed to evaluate the students' and teachers' opinions on the notion of supplementing lectures with CBL. In previous reports, discussion using clinical cases was primarily employed as the solitary component for conducting CBL. In the present study, three different but mutually exclusive components, such as case discussion, concept map. and critical thinking exercise on a specific topic in gastrointestinal pathophysiology. were integrated to form the multicomponent CBL (MC-CBL). Students reported that MC-CBL could promote application of the knowledge learned in lectures in a more appropriate context (92.42% positive response), enhance their learning efficiency (98.46% positive response), promote their active participation in the learning process (98.48% positive response), and help them in integrating physiological concepts with clinical science (98.46% positive response). Teachers observed that MC-CBL could promote active learning. analytic, and problem-solving skills of students. In conclusion, MC-CBL appeared to be an effective supplement for the lectures, providing an opportunity for the students to relate the knowledge learned during lectures.

J	Xu, L				Xu, Lei			Learning deep IA bidirectional intelligence	FRONTIERS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Editorial Material						Abstraction; Least mean square error reconstruction (Lmser); Cognition; Image thinking; Abstract thinking; Synthesis reasoning; TP18		There has been a framework sketched for learning deep bidirectional intelligence. The framework has an inbound that features two actions: one is the acquiring action, which gets inputs in appropriate patterns, and the other is A-S cognition, derived from the abbreviated form of words abstraction and self-organization, which abstracts input patterns into concepts that are labeled and understood by self-organizing parts involved in the concept into structural hierarchies. The top inner domain accommodates relations and a priori knowledge with the help of the A-I thinking action that is responsible for the accumulation-amalgamation and induction-inspiration. The framework also has an outbound that comes with two actions. One is called I-S reasoning, which makes inference and synthesis (I-S) and is responsible for performing various tasks including image thinking and problem solving, and the other is called the interacting action, which controls, communicates with, and inspects the environment. Based on this framework, we further discuss the possibilities of design intelligence through synthesis reasoning.

Inhibitory control during selective retrieval may hinder subsequent analogical thinking	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MEMORY INHIBITION; INFERENCE; ACCESS; INTERFERENCE; AWARENESS; BENEFITS; ROLES	Analogical reasoning is a complex cognitive activity that involves access and retrieval of pre-existing knowledge in order to find a suitable solution. Prior work has shown that analogical transfer and reasoning can be influenced by unconscious activation of relevant information. Based on this idea, we report two experiments that examine whether reduced access to relevant information in memory may further disrupt analogical reasoning unwittingly. In both experiments, we use an adaptation of the retrieval practice paradigm [1] to modulate memory accessibility of potential solutions to a subsequent set of analogy problems of the type 'A is to B as C is to ?'. Experiment 1 showed a retrieval-induced impairment in analogical problem solving. Experiment 2 replicated this finding and demonstrated that it cannot be due to the deliberative episodic retrieval of the solutions to the analogies. These findings, predictable from an inhibitory framework of memory control, provide a new focus for theories of analogical transfer and highlight the importance of unconscious memory processes that may modulate problem solving.

Higher education is challenged to develop innovative strategies to help college students develop career-specific competency and accelerate the transition from novice to expert. Technology innovations such as virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) have been successfully integrated into learning and training programs to create authentic learning experiences within simulated virtual learning environments to facilitate tacit knowledge acquisition and workplace expertise development, which traditionally takes years of empirical experience and apprenticeship training. This study aims to explore potential VR and MR interventions in construction education and workforce development. It is directed at enhancing understanding of key differences between novices and experts and how VR and MR may facilitate tacit knowledge acquisition and expertise development to address the current skills gap in the construction industry. A simulation of accessibility design review and assessment for a tiny house was conducted via VR and MR mock-ups with the participation of both student novices and professional experts to collect behavioral and perceptual data using instruments that included a think-aloud protocol, a pair of pre- and postsurvey questionnaires, and audio/video recordings. Comparative analyses were conducted, and the results indicated that student novices, despite their lack of expertise, demonstrated comparable patterns of behaviors and achieved design review outcomes similar to those of professional experts with the VR and MR mock-ups. The findings of this study contribute to the body of knowledge by providing preliminary evidence of learning affordances of VR and MR in bridging experience-related gaps and suggesting opportunities for accelerating workplace expertise development among college students via technology intervention. These findings also have the potential to inform instructional design and pedagogical approaches that integrate VR and MR technology in undergraduate construction and engineering curricula.

Successful primate conservation strategies require effective educational programs capable of enhancing critical system-thinking and responsible behavior towards these species. Arts-based conservation education can simultaneously foster cognitive and emotional processes. In this paper, we evaluate an arts-based educational program focused on the conservation of black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra). Our goals were to determine (1) whether children's knowledge changed with our educational techniques, (2) if there was a particular educational technique that better improved the children's learning, and (3) the children's emotional feedback regarding the whole program. A total of 229 children from communities located in primate-habitat areas, both inside and outside protected areas, participated in the study. Different educational techniques were tested (storytelling, theater and shadow puppets), contrasted with a control group, and evaluated through an analysis of drawings. Our results showed that children's knowledge increase with each art-based technique, with storytelling being the most effective for children's learning. Specific drawings indicators also revealed the increase of children's knowledge and a decrease of misconceptions between pre and post evaluations. Finally, a satisfaction survey about the program showed a high positive feedback. The study highlights the value of designing multidisciplinary projects, where arts-based education program (grounded in scientific information) has shown to be a successful way to communicate animal knowledge and promote conservation.

SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study was conducted survey in diverse community centers and shopping malls in Seoul, which yielded N = 209 datasets. To compare processed foods consumption behavior, we divided samples into two groups based on level of information about food additives (whether respondents felt that information on food additives was sufficient or not). We analyzed differences in attitudes toward food additives and toward purchasing processed foods, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral intentions to processed foods between sufficient information group and lack information group. RESULTS: The results confirmed that more than 78% of respondents thought information on food additives was insufficient. However, the group who felt information was sufficient had more positive attitudes about consuming processed foods and behavioral intentions than the group who thought information was inadequate. This study found people who consider that they have sufficient information on food additives tend to have more positive attitudes toward processed foods and intention to consume processed foods. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests increasing needs for nutrition education on the appropriate use of processed foods. Designing useful nutrition education requires a good understanding of factors which influence on processed foods consumption.

However, knowledge sharing in virtual communities still remains a big challenge given the concern of knowledge quantity and quality. The purpose of this paper is to explore the effect of individual differences on knowledge contributing, knowledge seeking, trust and norm of reciprocity. This study also explores the mean difference between knowledge seeking and knowledge contributing as well as the correlations between knowledge seeking, knowledge contributing, trust and reciprocity so as to provide some guidance for knowledge management practice in China. Design/methodology/approach - Data collected from 430 users of Web 2.0 virtual communities were used for data analysis. The independent samples t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), paired samples t-test and correlation analysis were employed. Findings - The independent samples t-test and one-way ANOVA present the effect of individual differences on knowledge contributing, knowledge seeking, trust and norm of reciprocity. The paired samples t-test suggests that employees are more likely to seek knowledge from than contribute knowledge to Web 2.0 virtual communities. The correlation analysis suggests there are positive correlations between knowledge contributing, knowledge seeking, trust and reciprocity. Practical implications - Knowledge management initiatives in Chinese organizations are encountered relatively less frequently, compared with western countries. The authors suggest the findings of this study provide useful insights into the informal knowledge sharing in Web 2.0 virtual communities, which is helpful for guiding knowledge management practice in China. Originality/value - Based on knowledge quantity and knowledge quality whose significance cannot be over-emphasized in virtual communities, this study explores employee perceptions of Web 2.0 virtual communities from the perspective of knowledge sharing, which the authors think provides a new view for knowledge sharing research and practice alike in China.

The art and science of recruitment to a cancer rapid autopsy programme: A qualitative study exploring patient and clinician experiences	PALLIATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						Rapid autopsy; recruitment; cancer		Background: CASCADE is a successful, Australia-first cancer rapid autopsy programme. Patients are recruited to the programme by their clinician once they understand that further treatment has only palliative intent. Despite its value, rapid autopsy is a rare research method owing partly to recruitment challenges. Aim: This research aimed to explore (1) how, in practice, clinicians select and recruit patients to the programme and (2) patient experiences of this process. Design: This was a qualitative study grounded in phenomenology. CASCADE team members (clinicians and researchers) and patients participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using an inductive, team-based approach to thematic analysis. Participants: Interviews were conducted with 31 participants (11 patients and 20 CASCADE team members). Results: Patient selection and recruitment to a rapid autopsy programme is both an art and science. In practice, patient selection is a subjective process that involves assessing a patient's psychosocial suitability for the programme. Trust and rapport are necessary for informing this assessment and to create an environment conducive to discussing rapid autopsy. Clinicians have also crafted their own ways of delivering information about CASCADE, with both clinicians and patients acknowledging that, if not handled sensitively, recruitment could cause distress. Overall, patients were satisfied with the way in which they were recruited. Conclusion: Findings provide insight into how clinicians successfully select and recruit patients to a rapid autopsy programme and suggests that discussing such topics are acceptable to end-of-life patients. This research also raises thought-provoking questions about the 'gatekeeping' role of clinicians in recruitment.

Digital technologies are increasingly turned to by environmental regulators to aid governance and communication. We examine the 'behind the scenes' institutional dynamics of a public body in its digital information provision (specifically dynamic river level information). Based on in-depth interviews with staff across a large environmental regulator we have brought to light four pivotal areas of institutional dynamics: (1) institutional priority and path dependency; (2) management and resources; (3) institutional identity and interdepartmental dynamics; and (4) ability and willingness to change. We gained insight into explicit and covert barriers and opportunities in relation to digital information provision that are likely to occur in other public institutions too. Besides identified barriers that were of a technical, structural, managerial or cultural nature, arguably the most important barrier was conceptual, i.e. the prevalence of 'efficiency and efficacy' perspectives on information and communications technology (ICT) amongst staff, in which ICT is primarily perceived as a neutral solution in itself to a wide variety of issues. Opportunities were nonetheless present in the form of enthusiasm and some critical thinking about digital innovation among staff, and an emphasis on the importance of stakeholder inclusion in the design of ICT. We conclude that there is a need to connect institutional social learning with the development of 'conceptual perspectives' on ICT, in which ICT is not seen as a solution in itself, but as a set of tools in a wider transformational process, or as a lens to look at existing or new practices. This is more likely to strengthen cornerstones of contemporary environmental governance, such as improved information access and reconceptualisations of 'traditional' barriers of uncertainty, liability and distrust in relation to information provision.

Published information is not always flawless and errors in published research should be expediently reported, preferably by a peer-review process. We review a recent publication by Gopalaswamy et al. (10.1111/2041-210X.12351) that challenges the use of "double sampling" in large-scale animal surveys. Double sampling is often resorted to as an established economical and practical approach for large-scale surveys since it calibrates abundance indices against absolute abundance, thereby potentially addressing the statistical shortfalls of indices. Empirical data used by Gopalaswamy et al. (10.1111/2041-210X.12351) to test their theoretical model, relate to tiger sign and tiger abundance referred to as an Index-Calibration experiment (IC-Karanth). These data on tiger abundance and signs should be paired in time and space to qualify as a calibration experiment for double sampling, but original data of IC-Karanth show lags of (up to) several years. Further, data points used in the paper do not match the original sources. We show that by use of inappropriate and incorrect data collected through a faulty experimental design, poor parameterization of their theoretical model, and selectively picked estimates from literature on detection probability, the inferences of this paper are highly questionable. We highlight how the results of Gopalaswamy et al. were further distorted in popular media. If left unaddressed, the paper of Gopalaswamy et al. could have serious implications on statistical design of large-scale animal surveys by propagating unreliable inferences.

It has very badly affected the socio-economic health of human and stuck the scientific community to think and rethink about its complete eradication. But due to no effective treatment or unavailability of vaccine the health professional could not show any significant improvement to control the pandemic. The situation needs newer molecule, vaccine or effective treatment to control covid-19 infection. Different target in viruses has been explored and proteases enzymes were found to be therapeutically effective target for the design of potential anti-covid-19 molecule as it plays the vital role in viral replication and assembly. Structure-based drug design was employed to discover the small molecule of anti-covid-19. Here we considered the small library of naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds and molecular docking, Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, free binding energy calculation and in-silico ADME calculations to identify the newer HITs. Based upon their score the two molecules were identified as promising candidate. The docking scores were found to be 7.643 and 7.065 for the HIT1 and HIT-2 respectively. In MD simulations study the RMSD values were found to be 4.3 angstrom & 4.9 angstrom respectively. To validate these results MM-GBSA was performed and their binding free energies were computationally determined. The prime energy values of identified HITs (-13412.45 & -13441.8 kJ/mole) were found to be very close proximity to reference molecule (-13493.05 kJ/mole). Then in-silico ADME calculations were performed to calculate the drug likeliness identified HITs. BY considering all the values comparative to reference molecule and obtained in-silico pharmacokinetic properties of identified HITs we can suggest that HIT1 and HIT-2 would be the most promising molecules that can inhibit the main protease enzyme of covid-19. These two molecules would become the potential drug candidate for the treatment of covid19 infections. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

J	Che, HY; Duan, YC				Che, Haoyang; Duan, Yucong			On the Logical Design of a Prototypical Data Lake System for Biological Resources	FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						data lake; DIKW; biological resources; unstructured data; XAI; explainability; interpretability	INFORMATION	Biological resources are multifarious encompassing organisms, genetic materials, populations, or any other biotic components of ecosystems, and fine-grained data management and processing of these diverse types of resources proposes a tremendous challenge for both researchers and practitioners. Before the conceptualization of data lakes, former big data management platforms in the research fields of computational biology and biomedicine could not deal with many practical data management tasks very well. As an effective complement to those previous systems, data lakes were devised to store voluminous, varied, and diversely structured or unstructured data in their native formats, for the sake of various analyses like reporting, modeling, data exploration, knowledge discovery, data visualization, advanced analysis, and machine learning. Due to their intrinsic traits, data lakes are thought to be ideal technologies for processing of hybrid biological resources in the format of text, image, audio, video, and structured tabular data. This paper proposes a method for constructing a practical data lake system for processing multimodal biological data using a prototype system named ProtoDLS, especially from the explainability point of view, which is indispensable to the rigor, transparency, persuasiveness, and trustworthiness of the applications in the field. ProtoDLS adopts a horizontal pipeline to ensure the intra-component explainability factors from data acquisition to data presentation, and a vertical pipeline to ensure the inner-component explainability factors including mathematics, algorithm, execution time, memory consumption, network latency, security, and sampling size. The dual mechanism can ensure the explainability guarantees on the entirety of the data lake system. ProtoDLS proves that a single point of explainability cannot thoroughly expound the cause and effect of the matter from an overall perspective, and adopting a systematic, dynamic, and multisided way of thinking and a system-oriented analysis method is critical when designing a data processing system for biological resources.

This study constructs and validates a scale to measure GEC-related attitudes (SGEC) for use with educators and the public. The results, which were validated by a wide sample (N = 962), show a factor structure of four well-defined interrelated factors (chi(2)= 268.75;p< .000; chi(2)/gl = 1.84; AIC = 394.75; CFI = .934; RMSEA = .042 [.034 .050]), with reliability (alpha = .817, glb = .894, ohm = .855). The factors were Social Responsibility (SR), Need to Cope (NC), Individual Responsibility (IR), Anthropogenic Origin (AO). These factors and findings suggest the SGEC can provide relevant information on: (i) awareness of the anthropogenic origins of GEC, (ii) perceptions of the need to deal with GEC, and attributions of (iii) social and (iv) individual responsibility in solving and mitigating GEC-related problems.

J	Seol, J; Yoon, KC; Park, J; Kim, KG				Seol, Jaehwang; Yoon, Ki-Cheol; Park, Jeongyun; Kim, Kwang Gi			Design of an Automatic Jackson-Pratt Drain Auxiliary System for Postoperative Management Applications	SURGICAL INNOVATION			English	Article						postoperative; Jackson-Pratt drain; negative pressure; blood clogged; stripping; auxiliary system		Background: After surgery, the exudation at a surgical site can cause complications and infections. The exudation is periodically removed through a Jackson-Pratt (JP) drain while maintaining a negative pressure in the JP bulb. However, the JP drainage tube may be clogged due to blood clotting. Thus, the periodic management of the JP drain is essential. In particular, the postoperative management of the JP drain includes squeezing and stripping it. In this study, we proposed a JP drain auxiliary system that can perform automatic stripping to assist specialists and nurses. Methodology: The proposed system was designed based on pre-experimental measurements and operated as a gripping and rolling device. Experimental Results: Twenty experiments were performed, and an average stripping efficiency of 93.8% was obtained. Conclusions: Consequently, we think that the proposed auxiliary system can automatically contribute to increase working efficiency for specialists and nurses.

Yet most models abstract from these issues and assume that agents successfully tackle selection problems. We design an experiment where a person who understands selection observes all the data required to account for it. Subjects make choices under uncertainty and their choices reveal valuable information that is biased due to the presence of unobservables. We find that almost no subjects optimally account for endogenous selection. On the other hand, behavior is far from random, but actually quite amenable to analysis: Subjects follow simple heuristics that result in a partial accounting of selection and mitigate mistakes.

Before performing molecular modeling, a virtual library of functional monomers was created containing forty frequently used monomers. The MD Simulations were first conducted to screen the top three monomers from virtual library in each porogen-acetonitrile, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. QM simulations were then performed with an aim to select the optimum monomer and progen solvent in which the QM Simulations were carried out; the monomers giving the highest binding energies were chosen as the candidate to prepare MIP in its corresponding solvent. The acetochlor, a widely used herbicide was chosen as the target analyte. According to the theoretical calculation results, the MIP with acetochlor as template was prepared by emulsion polymerization method using N,N-methylene bisacrylamide (MBAAM) as functional monomer and divinylbenzene (DVB) as cross-linker in chloroform. The synthesized MIP was then tested by equilibrium-adsorption method, and the MIP demonstrated high removal efficiency to the acetochlor. Mulliken charge distribution and H-1 NMR spectroscopy of the synthesized MIP provided insight on the nature of recognition during the imprinting process probing the governing interactions for selective binding site formation at a molecular level. We think the computer simulation method first proposed in this paper is a novel and reliable method for the design and synthesis of MIP. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of these specific environments on students' academic success, problem-solving skills and motivations were carefully analyzed and interpreted. In this context, mixed-method, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, was adopted. The pre-test-post-test control group designs were used in the quantitative dimension of the study and the focus group interview was conducted with the experimental group students to support the quantitative findings. The study group of the research involved 68 students in 7th grade in a secondary school. At the end of the research, on the basis of the quantitative data analysis it can be said that: According to the last-tests of the experimental and control groups, the virtual learning environment designed on the basis of the problem-based learning approach was more efficient on increasing the academic success and problem-solving skills of the experimental group students when compared to the control group students. However, findings of the motivation survey indicate that motivations of the experimental and control groups didn't significantly differentiate. According to the quantitative results of the research, experimental group students delivered positive opinions especially about making lessons more fun and relating to real-life, which are the parts of the virtual learning environment designed according to the problem-based learning approach. It was observed that, in terms of the activities, students had positive opinions mostly about giving the chance to discuss opinions and make interpretations. In addition to this, it was seen that the students believed that their problem-solving skills had developed thanks to the activities. Regarding the topic of conducting group studies while using virtual learning methods, students stated that they had positive opinions as these studies gave them the opportunity to exchange ideas. However, they were disturbed by the fact that there were too many irrelevant interpretations during the process.

SE measurements often come from spectral libraries based upon laboratory spectroscopic measurements, with uncertainties typically derived from repeated measurements. To go further, we organised a "round-robin" inter-comparison exercise involving SE measurements of three samples collected at seven different international laboratories. The samples were distilled water, which has a uniformly high spectral emissivity, and two artificial samples (aluminium and gold sheets laminated in polyethylene), with variable emissivities and largely specular and Lambertian characteristics. Large differences were observed between some measurements, with standard deviations over 2.5-14 mu m of 0.092, 0.054 and 0.028 emissivity units (15.98%, 7.56% and 2.92%) for the laminated aluminium sheet, laminated gold sheet and distilled water respectively. Wavelength shifts of up to 0.09 mu m were evident between spectra from different laboratories for the specular sample, attributed to system design interacting with the angular behaviour of emissivity. We quantified the impact of these SE differences on satellite LST estimation and found that emissivity differences resulted in LSTs differing by at least 3.5 K for each artificial sample and by more than 2.5 K for the distilled water. Our findings suggest that variations between SE measurements derived via laboratory setups may be larger than previously assumed and provide a greater contribution to LST uncertainty than thought. The study highlights the need for the infrared spectroscopy community to work towards standardized and interlaboratory comparable results.

Empirical demonstrations of abstract object encoding, independent of low-level structure, have relied on speech stimuli, and non-speech studies of object-category encoding (e.g., human vocalizations) often lack a systematic assessment of low-level information (e.g., vocalizations are highly harmonic). It is currently unknown whether abstract encoding constitutes a general functional principle that operates for auditory objects other than speech. We combined multivariate analyses of functional imaging data with an accurate analysis of the low-level acoustical information to examine the abstract encoding of non-speech categories. We observed abstract encoding of the living and human-action sound categories in the fine-grained spatial distribution of activity in the middle-to-posterior temporal cortex (e.g., planum temporale). Abstract encoding of auditory objects appears to extend to non-speech biological sounds and to operate in regions other than the anterior temporal lobe. Neural processes for the abstract encoding of auditory objects might have facilitated the emergence of speech categories in our ancestors.

As compared with more traditional conversational technologies, like wilds and forums, CCSAV is designed to promote more critical thinking and evidence-based reasoning, by using representations that highlight conceptual relationships between contributions, and through computational analytics that assess the structural integrity of the network. However, to date, CCSAV tools have achieved adoption primarily in small-scale educational contexts, and only to a limited degree in real world applications. We hypothesise that by reifying conversations as logical maps to address the shortcomings of chronological streams, CCSAV tools underestimate the importance of participation and interaction in enhancing collaborative knowledge-building. We argue, therefore, that CCSAV platforms should be socially augmented in order to improve their mediation capability. Drawing on Clark and Brennan influential Common Ground theory, we designed a Debate Dashboard, which augmented a CCSAV tool with a set of widgets that deliver meta-information about participants and the interaction process. An empirical study simulating a moderately sized collective deliberation scenario provides evidence that this experimental version outperformed the control version on a range of indicators, including usability, mutual understanding, quality of perceived collaboration, and accuracy of individual decisions. No evidence was found that the addition of the Debate Dashboard impeded the quality of the argumentation or the richness of content. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Consequently, clinical trials for orphan drugs are often smaller than those of non-orphan drugs, and they require the development of efficient trial designs relevant to small populations to gain the most information from the available data. The International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) is aimed at promoting international collaboration and advance rare diseases research worldwide, and has as one of its goals to contribute to 1000 new therapies for rare diseases. IRDiRC set up a Small Population Clinical Trials (SPCT) Task Force in order to address the shortcomings of our understanding in carrying out clinical trials in rare diseases.ResultsThe IRDiRC SPCT Task Force met in March 2016 to discuss challenges faced in the design of small studies for rare diseases and present their recommendations, structured around six topics: different study methods/designs and their relation to different characteristics of medical conditions, adequate safety data, multi-arm trial designs, decision analytic approaches and rational approaches to adjusting levels of evidence, extrapolation, and patients' engagement in study design.ConclusionsRecommendations have been issued based on discussions of the Small Population Clinical Trials Task Force that aim to contribute towards successful therapy development and clinical use. While randomised clinical trials are still considered the gold standard, it is recommended to systematically take into consideration alternative trial design options when studying treatments for a rare disease. Combining different sources of safety data is important to give a fuller picture of a therapy's safety profile. Multi-arm trials should be considered an opportunity for rare diseases therapy development, and funders are encouraged to support such trial design via international networks. Patient engagement is critical in trial design and therapy development, a process which sponsors are encouraged to incorporate when conducting trials and clinical studies. Input from multiple regulatory agencies is recommended early and throughout clinical development. Regulators are often supportive of new clinical trial designs, provided they are well thought through and justified, and they also welcome discussions and questions on this topic. Parallel advice for multiregional development programs should also be considered.

Educational interventions to improve people's understanding of key concepts in assessing the effects of health interventions: a systematic review	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						Consumer; Education; Health information; Health literacy; Critical health literacy; Critical appraisal; Critical thinking	WORLD-WIDE-WEB; INFORMATION; IMPACT; INTERNET; STUDENTS; TRIAL; CONSUMERS; QUALITY; TESTS	Background: Health information is readily accessible but is of variable quality. General knowledge about how to assess whether claims about health interventions are trustworthy is not common, so people's health decisions can be ill-informed, unnecessarily costly and even unsafe. This review aims to identify and evaluate studies of educational interventions designed to improve people's understanding of key concepts for evaluating claims about the effects of health interventions. Methods/Design: We searched multiple electronic databases and sources of grey literature. Inclusion criteria included all study types that included a comparison, any participants (except health professionals or health professional students) and educational interventions aimed at improving people's understanding of one or more of the key concepts considered necessary for assessing health intervention claims. Knowledge and/or understanding of concepts or skills relevant to evaluating health information were our primary outcome measures. Secondary outcomes included behaviour, confidence, attitude and satisfaction with the educational interventions. Two authors independently screened search results, assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. Results were summarised using descriptive synthesis. Results: Among 24 eligible studies, 14 were randomised trials and 10 used other study designs. There was heterogeneity across study participants, settings and educational intervention type, content and delivery. The risk of bias was high in at least one domain for all randomised studies. Most studies measured outcomes immediately after the educational intervention, with few measuring later. In most of the comparisons, measures of knowledge and skills were better among those who had received educational interventions than among controls, and some of these differences were statistically significant. The effects on secondary outcomes were inconsistent. Conclusions: Educational interventions to improve people's understanding of key concepts for evaluating health intervention claims can improve people's knowledge and skills, at least in the short term. Effects on confidence, attitude and behaviour are uncertain. Many of the studies were at moderate or greater risk of bias. Improvements in study quality, consistency of outcome measures and measures of longer-term effects are needed to improve confidence in estimates of the effects of educational interventions to improve people's understanding of key concepts for evaluating health intervention claims.

J	Kattenbeck, M; Elsweiler, D				Kattenbeck, Markus; Elsweiler, David			Understanding credibility judgements for web search snippets	ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Credibility; Information seeking behaviour; Biases; Search engine result page; Web searchers	INFORMATION-SEEKING; INTERNET; SKILLS	Purpose It is well known that information behaviour can be biased in countless ways and that users of web search engines have difficulty in assessing the credibility of results. Yet, little is known about how search engine result page (SERP) listings are used to judge credibility and in which if any way such judgements are biased. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach Two studies are presented. The first collects data by means of a controlled, web-based user study (N=105). Studying judgements for three controversial topics, the paper examines the extent to which users agree on credibility, the extent to which judgements relate to those applied by objective assessors and to what extent judgements can be predicted by the users' position on and prior knowledge of the topic. A second, qualitative study (N=9) utilises the same setup; however, transcribed think-aloud protocols provide an understanding of the cues participants use to estimate credibility. Findings The first study reveals that users are very uncertain when assessing credibility and their impressions often diverge from objective judges who have fact checked the sources. Little evidence is found indicating that judgements are biased by prior beliefs or knowledge, but differences are observed in the accuracy of judgements across topics. Qualitatively analysing think-aloud transcripts from participants think-aloud reveals ten categories of cues, which participants used to determine the credibility of results. Despite short listings, participants utilised diverse cues for the same listings. Even when the same cues were identified and utilised, different participants often interpreted these differently. Example transcripts show how participants reach varying conclusions, illustrate common mistakes made and highlight problems with existing SERP listings. Originality/value This study offers a novel perspective on how the credibility of SERP listings is interpreted when assessing search results. Especially striking is how the same short snippets provide diverse informational cues and how these cues can be interpreted differently depending on the user and his or her background. This finding is significant in terms of how search engine results should be presented and opens up the new challenge of discovering technological solutions, which allow users to better judge the credibility of information sources on the web.

First of all, chaotic mixing systems with different dynamic properties were chosen for the chaotic mixing process. Then, by solving the chaotic systems selected in the MATLAB with the Runge Kutta 45 (RK45) numerical solution algorithm, the results in the integer format were obtained. The obtained chaotic time-series results were transformed into 3-dimensional position information for the servomotors used in the mixer with the algorithm developed in MATLAB. The supervision was provided to ensure that the newly designed chaotic mixer was pacing chaotically in x, y, and z coordinates by transferring the chaotic position information to the Arduino Uno R3 card via USB 2.0. With the software developed in MATLAB, the performances of 7 diversified chaotic systems' trajectories and circular motion trajectories were compared over the numerical simulation orbital distribution ratio (ODR). In the final stage, in a solid-liquid mixture type, at the selected constant mixing time, experimental studies were performed where homogeneity and orbital distribution ratio (ODR) parameters were compared by using 7 diversified chaotic systems. The designed and produced chaotic mixer can also be used in experimental studies of certain liquid-liquid mixture types. It is thought that this prototype presented in the article will serve the aim of developing new chaotic mixer systems and algorithms to derive more homogeneous mixtures in a shorter time.

Preferences for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Information among Mexican, Cuban and Puerto Rican Women at Risk	PUBLIC HEALTH GENOMICS			English	Article						Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, genetics; Hispanic women; Qualitative research	HISPANIC WOMEN; FOLIC-ACID; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; HEALTH LITERACY; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; ACCULTURATION; PERCEPTIONS; BEHAVIORS; LATINAS	Background: Little is known about the preferences of at-risk Hispanic women to gain information on hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Aims: This study sought to qualitatively explore preferences for HBOC information among at-risk Mexican, Puerto Rican and Cuban women and to pilot a mock brochure aimed at Hispanic women. Methods: Hispanic women aged 18-65 years with a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer participated in a semi-structured interview. Data were analyzed using a combination of open-coding and content analysis. Results: Fifty-three women participated in the study. For the majority of content areas, there were no major differences between the subethnicities. All women reported discussing cancer with a doctor after a family member had been diagnosed and discussing cancer within their families; however, the content of the discussion varied. Cuban and Puerto Rican women reported using the Internet routinely for health care information while Mexican women said they did not have access to computers and did not use them. All women liked the content and photos in the brochure but Mexican women thought the reading level was too high. Preferences for the spokesperson focused on the need for Spanish-speaking health care providers. Conclusions: While the data show some similarities, such as patterns of cancer discussion and appreciation of the mock brochure, there were differences between the groups on information preferences. In designing HBOC education information for Hispanic audiences, it is important to consider varied channels for dissemination and preferences for specific types of information across subethnicities.

Does flare trial design affect the effect size of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in symptomatic osteoarthritis? A systematic review and meta-analysis	ANNALS OF THE RHEUMATIC DISEASES			English	Article							ETORICOXIB 30 MG; DOUBLE-BLIND; KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS; TREATING OSTEOARTHRITIS; TIAPROFENIC ACID; PARALLEL-GROUP; PLACEBO; EFFICACY; CELECOXIB; LUMIRACOXIB	Objectives It is thought that the clinical trial benefits of oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may relate to flare designs. The aim of this study was to examine the difference in NSAID (including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors) response in osteoarthritis (OA) trials based on different designs. Methods Systematic review was undertaken of the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL and the Cochrane library till February 2015. Randomised controlled trials assessing pain, function and/or stiffness following commencement of NSAIDs in flare and non-flare designs were eligible. Trials were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Meta-analyses were conducted to assess the effect sizes (ES) of NSAIDs for OA with flare versus non-flare trial designs. Results Fifty-seven studies including 33 263 participants assessing 26 NSAIDs were included. Twenty-two (39%) were flare design, 24 (42%) were non-flare designs, 11 (19%) were possible flare designs. On meta-analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in ES of NSAIDs versus placebo between flare and non-flare trial designs for absolute pain and function or stiffness at immediate-term (1 week), short-term (2-4 week) or longer-term (12-13 week) follow-up periods (p>0.05). However there was a lower ES for mean change in pain in flare and possible flare trials compared with non-flare trials at short-term follow-up (0.36 vs 0.69; p=0.05). Conclusions Contrary to previous understanding, flare trial designs do not result in an increased treatment effect for NSAIDs in people with OA compared with non-flare design. Whether flare design influences other outcomes such as joint effusion remains unknown.

The notion of operational parameterized building block is the key point of the approach, which focuses on two major phases: domain modeling and system modeling. Domain modeling consists in providing the classes of the building blocks grouped into different schemata. System modeling consists in building an actual model using the building blocks taken from the above-mentioned schemata; such building blocks are connected to each other according to the rules expressed in the schemata and are given actual parameters, As an example, a workflow management system supporting business process managing travel authorizations is presented. The workflow system is modeled and then used to synthesize a distributed prototype. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, modern engineering education should focus on developing students' innovative thinking and ability to solve engineering problems by designing creativity courses that foster students' creativity, critical thinking, and transfer of learning skills. Moreover, creativity training methods in engineering courses and teachers' provision of proper instruction strategies for instructing creative thinking are critical topics. Therefore, this study introduced project-based learning and SCAMPER teaching strategies in an information engineering project course and adopted Moodle as the learning platform. By engaging students in experimental activities for two semesters, this study investigated differences between high- and low-creativity learners in terms of cognition, personal motivation, and personally traits.

Tiny lenses are thought to deliver poor acuity because of diffraction; nevertheless, miniature insects have visual systems that allow a myriad of lifestyles. Here, we investigate whether size constraints result in an archetypal eye design shared between miniature dipterans by comparing the visual performance of the fruit fly Drosophila and the killer fly Coenosia. These closely related species have neural superposition eyes and similar body lengths (3 to 4 mm), but Coenosia is a diurnal aerial predator, whereas slow-flying Drosophila is most active at dawn and dusk. Using in vivo intracellular recordings and EM, we report unique adaptations in the form and function of their photoreceptors that are reflective of their distinct lifestyles. We find that although these species have similar lenses and optical properties, Coenosia photoreceptors have three-to fourfold higher spatial resolution and rate of information transfer than Drosophila. The higher performance in Coenosia mostly results from dramatically diminished light sensors, or rhabdomeres, which reduce pixel size and optical cross-talk between photoreceptors and incorporate accelerated phototransduction reactions. Furthermore, we identify local specializations in the Coenosia eye, consistent with an acute zone and its predatory lifestyle. These results demonstrate how the flexible architecture of miniature compound eyes can evolve to match information processing with ecological demands.

Imparting Scientific Literacy through an Online Materials Chemistry General Education Course	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Interdisciplinary/Multidisciplinary; Communication/Writing; Collaborative/Cooperative Learning; Internet/Web-Based Learning; Problem Solving/Decision Making; Materials Science; Minorities in Chemistry; Nanotechnology; Consumer Chemistry	NONSCIENCE MAJORS; GREEN CHEMISTRY; SCIENCE; JUSTICE	This study details the design and implementation of an online materials ire, chemistry general education (GE) course during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many pedagogical techniques involving active learning have been established in STEM major courses, their use within STEM general education courses for non-majors are not as well-established. The recently developed GE course at UCLA (termed Chemistry 3: Material World) utilized high-impact practices to introduce students to the scientific process and impart skills of critical thinking and scientific communication through its flexible activities and assignments. Emphasis was placed on collaborative learning, problem-solving, and interpreting scientific information from published reports. Additionally, content focused on social justice and community engagement was introduced throughout several topics (e.g., underrepresentation in science, war on drugs, nuclear proliferation, pollution, and global climate change) to showcase that chemistry is intricately related to bigger societal challenges. This article details our efforts in achieving the course learning outcomes and shares tangible results regarding the assessment of our teaching strategies from student feedback and reflections. We envision that this work will assist faculty in designing inclusive chemistry GE courses that focus on process versus content and adopting our teaching strategies in both in-person and online classrooms.

In response to challenges posed by moving classes online, previous studies have assessed whether an online environment can be effective for student learning. This work has found that active learning structures, which maximize information processing and require critical thinking, best support student learning. All too commonly, online and active learning are perceived as mutually exclusive. We argue the success of online learning requires facilitating active learning in online spaces. To highlight this intersection in practice, we use a case study of an online, active, and synchronous ecology and conservation biology course from the College of Natural Sciences at Minerva Schools at KGI. We use our perspectives as curriculum designers, instructors, and students of this course to offer recommendations for creating active online ecology courses. Key components to effective course design and implementation are as follows: facilitating critical "thinking like a scientist", integrating open-ended assignments into class discussion, and creating active in-class dialogues by minimizing lecturing. Based on our experience, we suggest that by employing active learning strategies, the future of ecology in higher education is not inhibited, but in fact supported, by opportunities for learning online.

Recent studies of actual and potential users have demonstrated that individuals' responses to the use of these tests for these purposes are complex, with privacy, disruptive consequences, potential for misuse, and secondary use by law enforcement cited as potential concerns. We conducted six focus groups with a diverse sample of participants (n = 62) who were aware of but had not used direct-to-consumer genetic tests, in an effort to understand more about what people considering these tests think about the potential value, risks, and benefits of such testing, taking into account use by third parties, such as potential kin and law enforcement. Participants differed widely in the perceived value of direct-to-consumer genetic tests for ancestry and kinship information for their own lives, including the desirability of contact with previously unknown relatives. Some perceived ancestry testing as mere curiosity or entertainment, while others, particularly those who had gaps in their family history, few living relatives, or who were adopted, saw greater value. Concerns about intrusion into one's life by purported kin and control of data were widespread, with many participants expressing concern about secondary uses of data that could harm users or their families. The use of direct-to-consumer genetic tests data for forensic genealogy elicited a particularly wide array of reactions, both spontaneously and in response to specific discussion prompts, mirroring the current public debate about law enforcement access to such data. The themes uncovered through our investigation warrant specific attention in the continued development of the science, policy, and practice of commercial direct-to-consumer genetic testing.

An Intuitive Approach for Predicting Potential Human Health Risk with the Tox21 10k Library	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ACTIVATED-RECEPTOR-GAMMA; NORMAL ORGAN WEIGHTS; II-THE-BRAIN; IN-VITRO; CHEMICAL TOXICITY; ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS; INTRINSIC CLEARANCE; HEPATIC-CLEARANCE; DRUG-METABOLISM; EXPOSURE	In vitro in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) analyses translating high-throughput screening (HTS) data to human relevance have been limited. This study represents the first report applying IVIVE approaches and exposure comparisons using the entirety of the Tox21 federal collaboration chemical screening data, incorporating assay response efficacy and quality of concentration response fits, and providing quantitative anchoring to first address the likelihood of human in vivo interactions with Tox21 compounds. This likelihood was assessed using a maximum blood concentration to in vitro response ratio approach (C-max/AC(50)), analogous to decision-making methods for clinical drug drug interactions. Fraction unbound in plasma (f(up)) and intrinsic hepatic clearance (CLint) parameters were estimated in silico and incorporated in a three-compartment toxicokinetic (TK) model to first predict C-max for in vivo corroboration using therapeutic scenarios. Toward lower exposure scenarios, 36 compounds of 3925 unique chemicals with curated activity in the HTS data using high quality dose response model fits and >= 40% efficacy gave "possible" human in vivo interaction likelihoods lower than median human exposures predicted in the United States Environmental Protection Agency's ExpoCast program. A publicly available web application has been designed to provide all Tox21-ToxCast dose-likelihood predictions. Overall, this approach provides an intuitive framework to relate in vitro toxicology data rapidly and quantitatively to exposures using either in vitro or in silico derived TIC parameters and can be thought of as an important step toward estimating plausible biological interactions in a high throughput risk-assessment framework.

Design of port regulation mechanisms for multilayer governance: A shanghai case study	MARITIME ECONOMICS & LOGISTICS			English	Article						port; dual regulation; multilayer governments; asymmetric information; common agency; generalized price	CONTAINER TERMINALS; EUROPEAN PORTS; POLICY; INTEGRATION; DEVOLUTION; EFFICIENCY; DELEGATION	This article studies port dual regulation mechanisms in which a central government and a local government act either simultaneously or sequentially. Optimal tariffs, port capacities and port efficiency levels under these dual regulation schemes are determined following a principal-agent approach. The theoretical research can assist the thinking process that prevails during the shaping of regulatory systems in the port sector. Moreover, the theoretical results obtained are applied to a case study involving the container terminals in the Port of Shanghai in China. Sensitivity analysis and comparative studies show that (i) dual regulation causes the highest distortion when the central government and the local government act sequentially, (ii) the port operator obtains the highest profit when the central-and local government act sequentially, (iii) the distortion becomes worse when the port operator's cost increases, the weight of the port operator's profit in the government's objectives decreases, or the sensitivity of port demand with respect to its price increases.

One is a lack of formal cognitive models of design processes that have the appropriate granularity: fine enough to distinguish differences among individuals and coarse enough to detect patterns of similar actions. The other is the inadequacies in automating the recourse-intensive analyses of data collected from large samples of designers. To overcome these barriers, we have developed the problem map (P-maps) ontological framework. It can be used to explain design thinking through changes in state models that are represented in terms of requirements, functions, artifacts, behaviors, and issues. The different ways these entities can be combined, in addition to disjunctive relations and hierarchies, support detailed modeling and analysis of design problem formulation. A node-link representation of P-maps enables one to visualize how a designer formulates a problem or to compare how different designers formulate the same problem. Descriptive statistics and time series of entities provide more detailed comparisons. Answer set programming (ASP), a predicate logic formalism, is used to formalize and trace strategies that designers adopt. Data mining techniques (association rule and sequence mining) are used to search for patterns among large number of designers. Potential uses of P-maps are computer-assisted collection of large data sets for design research, development of a test for the problem formulation skill, and a tutoring system.

Older Patients with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease and Their Perspectives on Prognostic Information: a Qualitative Study	JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						shared decision-making; dialysis risk; prognosis; palliative care; communication	ELDERLY-PATIENTS; DECISION-MAKING; CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT; NATIONAL-SURVEY; DIALYSIS; CARE; SURVIVAL; NEPHROLOGISTS; RECOMMENDATIONS; PERCEPTIONS	Background Prognostic information is key to shared decision-making, particularly in life-limiting illness like advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Objective To understand the prognostic information preferences expressed by older patients with CKD. Design and Participants Qualitative study of 28 consecutively enrolled patients over 65 years of age with non-dialysis dependent CKD stages 3b-5, receiving care in a multi-disciplinary CKD clinic. Approach Semi-structured telephone or in-person interviews to explore patients' preference for and perceived value of individualized prognostic information. Interviews were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Key Results We completed interviews with 28 patients (77.7 +/- SD 6.8 years, 69% men). Patients varied in their preference for prognostic information and more were interested in their risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) than in life expectancy. Many conflated ESKD risk with risk of death, perceiving a binary choice between dialysis and quick decline and death. Patients expressed that prognostic information would allow them to plan, take care of important business, and think about their treatment options. Patients were accepting of prognostic uncertainty and imagined leveraging it to nurture hope or motivate them to better manage risk factors. They endorsed the desire to receive prognosis of life expectancy even though it may be hard to accept or difficult to talk about but worried it could create helplessness for other patients in their situation. Conclusion Most, but not all, patients were interested in prognostic information and could see its value in motivating behavior change and allowing planning. Some patients expressed concern that information on life expectancy might cause depression and hopelessness. Therefore, prognostic information is most appropriate as part of a clinical conversation that fosters shared decision-making and helps patients consider treatment risks, benefits, and burdens in context of their lives.

J	Zhu, JJ; Liu, SF; Li, LH				Zhu Jian-Jun; Liu Si-Feng; Li Li-Hong			Research on four kinds of uncertain preference information aggregation approach in group decision making	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Cybernetics; Group theory; Decision making		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to aggregate different preference information in group decision-making process such as interval preference order, interval utility value, interval number reciprocal comparison matrix, and interval number complementary comparison matrix Design/methodology/approach - First, the consistency definitions of four kinds of uncertain preference information are defined. Then, the upper- and low errors are introduced to solve the inconsistent decision-making case. Following that, the weight model for each uncertain preference is proposed, respectively. Findings - The aggregation approach based on minimal group deviation errors is suggested in order to obtain the utmost consistent opinion In addition, the consistency judgment level and consistency extent are defined owing to the aggregation result Research limitations/implications - The calculation scale is large, if many decision makers will attend group decision-making process. Practical implications A very useful approach for aggregation of the different preference in group decision-making case. Originality/value - Because of differences in knowledge structure, judgment level, and individual preference, decision makers express their judgment preferences via differently structured decision-making processes. Owing to the complexity and uncertainty of decision-making problems and the fuzziness of human thought, it is unrealistic to depict complex problems in the certain preference style For decision-making preference structures, group decision-making aggregation approaches include the aggregation on the same kind of preference structure and the different kinds of preference structures. The study on the aggregation of the same kind of preference structure has received a deal of attention, but study into the aggregation of the different kinds of uncertainty preference structures is still a new field.

Thirty 90-min seminars were audio taped, transcribed and coded using a Questioning Framework designed for this study. The framework includes types and levels of questions, related wording and examples. The results of this study indicate that the majority of questions asked by tutors and students in the first three years of the program were framed at the low level (knowledge, comprehension, and application) and were aimed at seeking yes/no responses and factual information more so than probing. Although these questions are important to facilitate the teaching/ learning process, educators and students need to increase the number of questions requiring analysis, synthesis, and evaluation as well as questions that involve probing, exploration, and explanation - questions believed to activate and facilitate critical thinking skills. Recommendations include the need for students and tutors to be taught how to question, the creation of a supportive environment for questioning and the use of appropriate strategies to teach the use of higher order questions. Future research using a cross sectional longitudinal design and qualitative approaches are also recommended. This study has direct implications for enhancing student learning and the development of nurse educators. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tang, ZY; Ye, Y; Jiang, ZD; Fu, CW; Huang, R; Yao, D				Tang, Ziyi; Ye, Yu; Jiang, Zhidian; Fu, Chaowei; Huang, Rong; Yao, Dong			A data-informed analytical approach to human-scale greenway planning: Integrating multi-sourced urban data with machine learning algorithms	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING			English	Article						Greenway planning; Multi-sourced urban data; Data-informed urban design; Machine learning algorithms	GOOGLE STREET VIEW; DENSITY; LANDSCAPE; DESIGN; DIVERSITY; NETWORK; WALKING; ACCESSIBILITY; SUITABILITY; TRAVEL	Urban greenways have been recognized as an important strategy to improve human-scale quality in high-density built environments. Nevertheless, current greenway suitability analysis mainly focuses on geographical and natural issues, failing to account for human-scale urban design factors. Accordingly, this study proposes a data-informed approach to planning urban greenway networks using a combination of classical urban design theories, multi-sourced urban data, and machine learning algorithms. Maoming City in China was used as a case study. Per classical urban design theories, specifically, Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance-to-transit, were selected as key factors. A series of new urban data, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images, were applied in conjunction with machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to measure these key factors at a human-scale resolution and generate an optimized greenway suitability analysis. This analytical approach is an attempt to take human-scale concerns into account on a city-wide scale regarding greenway network generation. It also pushes the methodological boundaries of greenway planning by combining classical urban design thinking with new urban data and new techniques.

Tunable coupler design is used to reduce the problem of parasitic coupling and frequency crowding in many-qubit systems and thus thought to be advantageous. Here we design an extensible 5-qubit system in which center transmon qubit can couple to every four near-neighboring qubits via a capacitive tunable coupler and experimentally demonstrate high-fidelity controlled-phase (CZ) gate by manipulating central qubit and one near-neighboring qubit. Speckle purity benchmarking and cross entropy benchmarking are used to assess the purity fidelity and the fidelity of the CZ gate. The average purity fidelity of the CZ gate is 99.69 +/- 0.04% and the average fidelity of the CZ gate is 99.65 +/- 0.04%, which means that the control error is about 0.04%. Our work is helpful for resolving many challenges in implementation of large-scale quantum systems.

Modelling ancient Chinese time ontology	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						ancient Chinese time; historical ontology; ontology; temporal information; time ontology		Temporal information is one of the essential components in many domains, especially those related to history. Up until the twentieth century, the Chinese used a lunisolar calendar with the title of an Emperor and a reign period to express temporal information. When describing a historical event in Chinese history, it is inadequate to use existing time ontologies as presented in the traditional Chinese way of thinking to capture and encode time. To date, no attention in the field has been given to modelling ancient Chinese time. In this paper, we identify the problems encountered when modelling Chinese time resulting from the distinctive nature of a non-western time scale. We design a new model of temporal information with combined approaches, which are more appropriate for Chinese dynasties, emperors, and reign periods, and apply the OWL-Time ontology onto the ancient Chinese lunisolar calendar. This approach can also be applied to other ancient time-keeping methods in non-western time scales.

Retail pharmacy staff perceptions of design strengths and weaknesses of electronic prescribing	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							PATIENT SAFETY; PROTOCOL ANALYSIS; DECISION-MAKING; USABILITY; SYSTEMS; TECHNOLOGY; CHALLENGES; ERRORS	Objective This paper explored pharmacy staff perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) design in retail pharmacies using the sociotechnical systems framework. This study examined how adoption of e-prescribing technology is affecting clinical practice and patient care. Materials and methods Direct observations and think aloud protocols were used to collect data from seven retail pharmacies. Results Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians reported strengths of e-prescribing design that facilitated pharmacy work which included: legibility, ease of archiving, quick access to prescriptions and consistency in the format of electronic prescriptions le-prescriptions). Design weaknesses and potential hazards to patient care associated with e-prescribing systems were due to differences between pharmacy and prescriber computer systems which resulted in the selection of wrong patient or drug (name, directions, dose, strength, formulation, package sizes). There were unique strengths and weaknesses in the design of e-prescriptions peculiar to the three pharmacy computer systems examined in this study. Discussion Findings from this study can help inform policy on creating e-prescribing design standards for pharmacy. e-Prescribing system developers can use the results of this study to identify and apply the most usable features of the three main pharmacy computer systems to design systems that support dispensing efficiency and safety. Conclusions This is the first study to highlight design flaws with e-prescribing in retail pharmacies. The sociotechnical systems framework was useful in providing an indepth understanding of the pharmacist and pharmacy technician's interface with e-prescribing technology. This information can be used by policy makers to create e-prescribing standards for pharmacies.

J	Mainetti, M; Ascoli, GA				Mainetti, Matteo; Ascoli, Giorgio A.			A Neural Mechanism for Background Information-Gated Learning Based on Axonal-Dendritic Overlaps	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							STRUCTURAL PLASTICITY; WIRING ECONOMY; MEMORY; BRAIN; HIPPOCAMPAL; PLACEMENT; NETWORKS; SPARSE; CELLS	Experiencing certain events triggers the acquisition of new memories. Although necessary, however, actual experience is not sufficient for memory formation. One-trial learning is also gated by knowledge of appropriate background information to make sense of the experienced occurrence. Strong neurobiological evidence suggests that long-term memory storage involves formation of new synapses. On the short time scale, this form of structural plasticity requires that the axon of the pre-synaptic neuron be physically proximal to the dendrite of the post-synaptic neuron. We surmise that such "axonal-dendritic overlap" (ADO) constitutes the neural correlate of background information-gated (BIG) learning. The hypothesis is based on a fundamental neuroanatomical constraint: an axon must pass close to the dendrites that are near other neurons it contacts. The topographic organization of the mammalian cortex ensures that nearby neurons encode related information. Using neural network simulations, we demonstrate that ADO is a suitable mechanism for BIG learning. We model knowledge as associations between terms, concepts or indivisible units of thought via directed graphs. The simplest instantiation encodes each concept by single neurons. Results are then generalized to cell assemblies. The proposed mechanism results in learning real associations better than spurious co-occurrences, providing definitive cognitive advantages.

Design and Implementation of a System-Based Course in Musculoskeletal Medicine for Medical Students	JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME			English	Article							EDUCATION; ADEQUACY; NEEDS	Background: The amount of time devoted to musculoskeletal medicine in the typical undergraduate curriculum is disproportionately low compared with the frequency of musculoskeletal complaints that occur in a general practice. Consequently, whether because of the quantity or quality of the education, the competence level of graduating physicians regarding musculoskeletal problems is inadequate. Our purposes were to design a self-contained, system-based course in musculoskeletal medicine for medical students in the preclinical years and to measure the level of competence achieved by a class of first-year medical students who took the course. Methods: The course was formulated by faculty from the departments of orthopaedic surgery, anatomy, and rheumatology and included elements of both objectives-based and problem-centered curricular models. The clinical lectures were preceded by pertinent anatomy lectures and dissections to provide a context for the clinical information. The lectures on basic science were designed to rationalize and explicate clinical practices. Small-group activities were incorporated to permit engagement of the students in critical thinking and problem-solving. A general musculoskeletal physical examination was taught in two two-hour-long small-group sessions with the orthopaedic residents serving as instructors. Cognitive competency was evaluated with use of comprehensive anatomy laboratory and written examinations, the latter of which included a validated basic competency examination in musculoskeletal medicine. Process-based skills were evaluated in the small-group meetings and in a timed, mock patient encounter in which each student's ability to perform the general musculoskeletal physical examination was assessed. Results: The course lasted six weeks and consisted of forty-four lecture hours, seventeen hours of small-group meetings, and twenty-eight hours of anatomy laboratory. The average student score on the basic competency examination was 77.8%, compared with 59.6% for a historical comparison group (p < 0.05). Each student demonstrated the ability to adequately perform a general musculoskeletal physical examination in twenty minutes. The survey of student opinion after the course indicated a high level of student satisfaction. Conclusions: The main features of the course were: (1) an emphasis on both cognitive and process-based knowledge; (2) more contact hours and broader content than in previously described courses in musculoskeletal medicine; (3) the use of small groups to focus on problem-solving and physical examination competencies; (4) basic-science content directly related to clinical goals. These features might be used at other institutions that employ a system-based curriculum for the preclinical years to help improve competence in musculoskeletal medicine.

J	Cavojova, V; Brezina, I; Jurkovic, M				Cavojova, Vladimira; Brezina, Ivan; Jurkovic, Marek			Expanding the bullshit research out of pseudo-transcendental domain	CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Bullshit receptivity; General bullshit receptivity scale; Epistemically suspect beliefs; Ontological confusion; Analytical thinking	COGNITIVE REFLECTION; PARANORMAL BELIEFS; RECEPTION	The ability to distinguish bullshit from factual, but less appealing, information is becoming a crucial skill in present-day society. The aim of this paper was to extend the research conducted by Pennycook et al. (Judgment and Decision Making, 10(6), 549-563, 2015) by developing and validating the General Bullshit Receptivity Scale (GBRS), designed to measure bullshit in more general and non-transcendental context, than the Bullshit Receptivity Scale (BSR). In this paper we assessed the psychometric properties of the GBRS on representative sample of Slovak participants (N = 458) and explored the relation between the GBRS and original BSR scale, epistemically suspect beliefs, ontological confusion, spirituality, personality and analytical thinking. People who thought the randomly generated transcendental statements were more profound were more susceptible to accepting more general bullshit and other epistemically suspect beliefs, and this tendency was accompanied with a low level of analytical thinking. Non-cognitive factors (agreeableness, spirituality) also contributed to perceptions the bullshit was profound and truthful. The most "impressive" bullshit was bullshit that did not contain obscure vocabulary but seemingly provided recipients with intuitive, though untruthful insights. We believe we have succeeded in constructing and refining a new measure for detecting other kind of bullshit that enables us to better understand the underlying cognitive mechanisms and personality variables.

The miscibility and depth profile of PCBM in P3HT: thermodynamic information to improve organic photovoltaics	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							POLYMER SOLAR-CELLS; EFFICIENCY; SURFACE; POLY(3-HEXYLTHIOPHENE); MORPHOLOGY; NETWORK; ENERGY; FILMS	Recent work has shown that poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the surface-functionalized fullerene 1-(3-methyloxycarbonyl) propyl(1-phenyl[6,6])C-61 (PCBM) are much more miscible than originally thought, and the evidence of this miscibility requires a return to understanding the optimal morphology and structure of organic photovoltaic active layers. This manuscript describes the results of experiments that were designed to provide quantitative thermodynamic information on the miscibility, interdiffusion, and depth profile of P3HT : PCBM thin films that are formed by thermally annealing initial bilayers. It is found that the resultant thin films consist of a 'bulk' layer that is not influenced by the air or substrate surface. The composition of PCBM in this 'bulk' layer increases with increased PCBM loading in the original bilayer until the 'bulk' layer contains 22 vol% PCBM. The introduction of additional PCBM into the sample does not increase the amount of PCBM dispersed in this 'bulk' layer. This observation is interpreted to indicate that the miscibility limit of PCBM in P3HT is 22 vol%, while the precise characterization of the depth profiles in these films shows that the PCBM selectively segregates to the silicon and near air surface. The selective segregation of the PCBM near the air surface is ascribed to an entropic driving force.	[Chen, Huipeng; Hegde, Raghavendra; Dadmun, M.

J	Renström, S				Renstrom, Sara			Supporting diverse roles for people in smart energy systems	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Smart grid; Energy use; Demand-side management; Smart home; User-centred design; Generative techniques	USERS; GRIDS; CONSUMPTION	More prominent roles for households are often suggested in visions of smart energy systems. To this point, most research and design efforts are aimed at householders who are interested in energy and/or want or play an active role in smart energy systems. Therefore, the study presented in this paper aims to identify other roles for people and examines ways to support those roles. In generative group sessions, sixteen participants envisioned future living in smart energy systems. The findings show that the participants discussed diverse roles, with some wishing to be guided, while others wanted to think for themselves, for instance. Support, in the shape of products, services, and systems, was found to be able to serve three purposes; give information, enable control, and change the preconditions for energy use. When designing support, diversity could be embraced by looking beyond energy use to include ways to enable using less resources in everyday activities. These findings contribute to nuancing the roles people could play in smart energy systems and propose implications for design of smart energy technologies.

Repositories help managing design artifacts by offering adequate storage and manipulation services. Some of the most important features of a repository are version management and activity management. Versioning comprises the specification, storage, and maintenance of versioned design objects whereas activity management is responsible for cooperation control, designflow management and management of design transactions processing versioned design objects. Regarding these issues (version and activity management) repository technology, as we think, should not only provide predefined services, but should be flexible enough to reflect different application needs. For that reason, we propose to provide repository managers by generic methods, i.e. by generating the corresponding functionality. In this paper, we consider a representative cooperation model, which is based on versioning services, in order to identify the major data manipulation and activity control needs of cooperative design applications. We will focus on the data manipulation needs by introducing our generative approach for customizing versioning facilities. Additionally, we will outline our ideas of applying a generative approach also for the provision of tailored activity control services. Thus, the paper wants to show that by exploiting generic methods and reuse as well as the extensibility properties of new object-relational database technology, repository managers can be flexibly tailored to special application needs and, thereby, applications do not have to be forced to deal with systems only providing pre-defined services.

Patients use of mobile health applications: what general practitioners think	FAMILY PRACTICE			English	Article						Delivery of health care; general practice; general practitioners; mobile applications; patient participation; primary health care	DIABETES MANAGEMENT; CARE	Chronic disease patients are adopting self-management techniques, such as using mobile health applications (apps). As GPs are the main caregivers of chronic disease patients, obtaining GP perspectives regarding patient use of mobile health apps is vital in understanding longer term value and feasibility of these apps. The aim was to determine GP perceptions of their current and potential roles in the use of health apps by their patients and how patient-focused apps affect patient management. Ten GPs participated in semi-structured, face-to-face interviews, which focused on their perceptions of, and involvement in, the use of patient-focused health apps. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed by two independent reviewers. GPs found that apps complemented their role in patient management as additional sources of medical information of their patients. They perceived that patient-focused apps would be part of their future practices; however they noted that further work was required to incorporate them into their current practices. Currently, the main role of GPs was in promoting apps to patients. Suggestions for further engagement in mobile health included regularly reviewing patient data entered into health apps during consultations. GPs view patient-focused health apps positively, particularly to support them in providing patient care. Discussing information recorded in apps during consultations and frequent promotion of apps are feasible ways to integrate apps into their current work practices. Further studies involving evaluations of apps in improving health care delivery and patient communication in general practice are required.

Co-design of an NHS primary care health check for autistic adults	AUTISM			English	Article						autism; autism spectrum disorders; health check; health services; qualitative research	INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; IMPROVE HEALTH; EXPERIENCES; MORTALITY	Autistic people experience more health conditions and earlier mortality. This study investigated views about a primary care health check for autistic adults to inform its design. Fifty-one people participated in consultation groups and interviews, comprising autistic adults (some with co-occurring intellectual disabilities), adults with intellectual disabilities, supporters and health professionals. Participants wanted the health check to cover physical and mental health and social functioning. They emphasised the importance of sharing information about individual needs and associated adjustments before the health check. They highlighted the need to change the way healthcare services communicate with autistic people, such as reducing phone contact and booking appointments online. They wanted individual choice in how the health check was completed, with video call or email offered alongside face-to-face. Participants raised the need for further training of primary care staff on autism, to highlight the diversity of experiences of autistic people and ways in which difficulties, such as pain, may present differently. Clinicians raised questions about the capacity of mental health and social care services to meet the additional needs potentially identified through the health check. This study represents a key step in the development and co-design of a UK primary care health check for autistic people. Lay abstract Autistic people are on average more likely to experience poor health than people who are not autistic. Health checks have been shown to improve access to effective healthcare. This study investigated people's views about a primary care health check for autistic adults. We held discussion groups and interviewed autistic adults, adults with intellectual disabilities, supporters and health professionals. People wanted the health check to look at a person's physical and mental health, and how they were doing socially. They thought people should be able to share information about their needs and the reasonable adjustments they would like before the health check. They wanted healthcare services to change the way they communicate with autistic people, such as being able to book appointments online rather than by telephone. They wanted a choice in how the health check was completed, with video call or email offered as well as face-to-face appointments. People thought further training of primary care staff on autism was needed, to increase awareness of the diversity of experiences of autistic people and ways in which difficulties, such as pain, may present differently to non-autistic people. Clinicians raised questions about whether mental health and social care services could meet the additional needs that might be identified through the health check. We used this information to design an NHS primary care health check for autistic people in collaboration with autistic people, supporters and health professionals.

Far less is known regarding the neurocognitive mechanisms underpinning the capacity to envisage non-personal future occurrences, known as semantic future thinking. Moreover the degree of overlap between the neural substrates supporting episodic and semantic forms of prospection remains unclear. To this end, we sought to investigate the capacity for episodic and semantic future thinking in Alzheimer's disease (n = 15) and disease-matched behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (n = 15), neurodegenerative disorders characterized by significant medial temporal lobe (MTL) and frontal pathology. Participants completed an assessment of past and future thinking across personal (episodic) and non personal (semantic) domains, as part of a larger neuropsychological battery investigating episodic and semantic processing, and their performance was contrasted with 20 age and education-matched healthy older Controls. Participants underwent whole-brain Tl-weighted structural imaging and voxel-based morphometry analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between gray matter integrity and episodic and semantic future thinking. Relative to Controls, both patient groups displayed marked future thinking impairments, extending across episodic and semantic domains. Analyses of covariance revealed that while episodic future thinking deficits could be explained solely in terms of episodic memory proficiency, semantic prospection deficits reflected the interplay between episodic and semantic processing. Distinct neural correlates emerged for each form of future simulation with differential involvement of prefrontal, lateral temporal, and medial temporal regions. Notably, the hippocampus was implicated irrespective of future thinking domain, with the suggestion of lateralization effects depending on the type of information being simulated. Whereas episodic future thinking related to right hippocampal integrity, semantic future thinking was found to relate to left hippocampal integrity. Our findings support previous observations of significant MTL involvement for semantic forms of prospection and point to distinct neurocognitive mechanisms which must be functional to support future-oriented forms of thought across personal and non-personal contexts.

J	Srivani, M; Murugappan, A				Srivani, M.; Murugappan, Abirami			Design of a Cognitive Knowledge Representation Model to Assess the Reasoning Levels of Primary School Children	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Customized AI based teaching; Cognitive performance test; Reasoning coefficient; Cognition level; Knowledge representation; Cognitive metrics	MATHEMATICAL THINKING; STUDENTS PERFORMANCE; TASKS	Background and aim: In recent days, the research on student's intelligence level modelling is a challenging Artificial Intelligence (AI) task, which gains more attraction because it provides actionable insights to the tutor by analysing the intelligence level of the learners. Each learner's knowledge, comprehension, and intellectual capacities are unique. It is critical to identify these capacities and provide learners, particularly slow learners, with the necessary knowledge. Cognitive Performance Test (CPT) is an essential component for assessing the knowledge level of students. The reasoning level or coefficient deals with the analysis of the thinking capability in a logical way. It also reflects the child's learning potential. The main aim of the proposed system is to design a Cognitive Knowledge Representation Model (CKRM), which fuses Cognitive Performance Metrics (CPM) calculation and Reasoning Coefficient Calculation (RCC) algorithms to assess the student's intelligence level. The result of the proposed system is stratification of students to three different ranges of reasoning coefficient.Methods: The CKRM consists of the following phases: data collection, statistical Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model building and analysis, which involve the assessment of the knowledge level using CPT and calculation of reasoning coefficient using First Order Logic (FOL), and finally model evaluation using cognitive evaluation metrics. CPM and RCC algorithms have been proposed in this paper to calculate the student's reasoning coefficient by using the forward chaining FOL inference engine. The dataset is a real time data which consists of the academic and cognitive performance details of school students from classes 1 to 6 for the year 2019 to 2020. The academic data are collected from the Educational Management Information System (EMIS) maintained by the school. The cognitive performance data are collected by conducting the tests for the students using the memory training application called Lumosity.Results: The proposed system's performance is evaluated using ten Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in which the Quadratic Discriminant Analysis achieved an accuracy of 0.97 for classes 1, 2, and 3. For classes 4, 5, and 6, nearly twelve ML algorithms are evaluated in which Random Forest (RF) Classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.98. Six math expert committee teachers concluded that the reasoning coefficient value was acceptable with an average accuracy of 0.92 for classes 1, 2, 3 and 0.9 for classes 4, 5, 6. In comparison to the pre-existing models employed in the prior research, it was determined that the created CKRM (academic and cognitive) was superior. The cognitive metrics such as taskability, Response Time (RT), knowledge capacity and utilization has also been evaluated. The average values of taskability, RT, knowledge capacity and knowledge utilization are 0.85, 0.81, 0.55, and 0.44.Conclusion: The ultimate goal is to make customized teaching easier; hence, this article involves determining a student's cognitive level by estimating their reasoning coefficient. The suggested approach analyses and categorizes students' cognitive abilities, such as memory, reasoning, problem solving, thinking, and logical reasoning, using three different reasoning coefficients. This approach assists teachers in determining the degree of intelligence of their students.

A Focus on Polarity: Investigating the Role of Orientation Cues in Mediating Student Performance on mRNA Synthesis Tasks in an Introductory Cell and Molecular Biology Course	BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						Central dogma; transcription; introductory biology; polarity; scientific thinking	REPRESENTATIONAL TRANSLATION; DNA; CONCRETE; SCIENCE	The central dogma has served as a foundational model for information flow, exchange, and storage in the biological sciences for several decades. Despite its continued importance, however, recent research suggests that novices in the domain possess several misconceptions regarding the aforementioned processes, including those pertaining specifically to the formation of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcripts. In the present study, we sought to expand upon these observations through exploration of the influence of orientation cues on students' aptitude at synthesizing mRNAs from provided deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) template strands. Data indicated that participants (n=45) were proficient at solving tasks of this nature when the DNA template strand and the mRNA molecule were represented in an antiparallel orientation. In contrast, participants' performance decreased significantly on items in which the mRNA was depicted in a parallel orientation relative to the DNA template strand. Furthermore, participants' Grade Point Average, self-reported confidence in understanding the transcriptional process, and spatial ability were found to mediate their performance on the mRNA synthesis tasks. Collectively, these data reaffirm the need for future research and pedagogical interventions designed to enhance students' comprehension of the central dogma in a manner that makes transparent its relevance to realworld scientific phenomena.

Part 2: The PREMIUM methodology, a structured approach	JOURNAL OF LOSS PREVENTION IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES			English	Article						process design; engineering line diagram; process flowsheet		The PREMIUM methodology is presented. This methodology provides a structured approach to the development of engineering line diagrams from process flowsheets. The generation of the method through a series of 'synthesis' and 'evaluation' steps is described. The structural features of the method-the different levels, groups, objectives and thought prompts are detailed. Associated 'support tools' for handling operating states and transitions and for providing detailed decision support are presented. The mode of application of the methodology and the outcome of its use in a live trial at ICI are outlined. The use of the methodology structure to support a number of features aimed at overcoming the shortfalls in current design practice is discussed. The shortfalls addressed are those associated with: safety, health, environment (SHE) and operability; the steady-state mindset; lack of formal training; lack of standardisation; poor management of information and poor management of interactions, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This amplifier uses reverse thinking to combine the tri-band impedance matching network with the power amplifier to mismatch the intermediate frequency as the isolation band. And the intermediate frequency is 3.0 GHz. Besides, the design process of dual-band power amplifier is given, and an example is given. Through the actual test results of the amplifier, it can be seen that the additional power efficiency of the amplifier at the frequencies of 2.6GHz and 3.4GHz is about 60%, the output power is more than 40dBm, and the gain is above 10dB. In the test results, it can be seen that the stopband of the power amplifier is 2.95-3.05GHz, the minimum gain and the minimum drain efficiency output power of the stopband are -1dB and 2%, which has a good stopband suppression effect.

Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and MANOVA, considering gender, professional level, and sector of activity, respectively. Multiple regression was used to assess the impact of job satisfaction and motivation on burnout.Results: The only variable that distinguished participants was sector of activity. Cardiologists working in the private sector worked fewer weekly hours during COVID-19, while those in the public sector worked more. The latter expressed more desire to reduce their working hours than those who worked in private medicine and in both sectors. There were no differences between sectors in work motivation, while job satisfaction was higher in the private sector. Moreover, job satisfaction negatively predicted burnout.Conclusions: Our findings point to a deterioration in working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, with its consequences being felt especially in the public sector, which may have contributed to the lower levels of satisfaction among cardiologists who worked exclusively in this sector, but also for those working in both public and private sectors. & COPY; 2023 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia.

Evaluating In-Car Movements in the Design of Mindful Commute Interventions: Exploratory Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						mental health; stress; stress management; mindfulness; in-car experience; interventions; just-in-time interventions; autonomous vehicles; cars; driving; breathing; mindful movement	HATHA YOGA; STRESS; RESPONSES	Background: The daily commute could be a right moment to teach drivers to use movement or breath towards improving their mental health. Long commutes, the relevance of transitioning from home to work, and vice versa and the privacy of commuting by car make the commute an ideal scenario and time to perform mindful exercises safely. Whereas driving safety is paramount, mindful exercises might help commuters decrease their daily stress while staying alert. Increasing vehicle automation may present new opportunities but also new challenges. Objective: This study aimed to explore the design space for movement-based mindful interventions for commuters. We used qualitative analysis of simulated driving experiences in combination with simple movements to obtain key design insights. Methods: We performed a semistructured viability assessment in 2 parts. First, a think-aloud technique was used to obtain information about a driving task. Drivers (N= 12) were given simple instructions to complete movements (configural or breath-based) while engaged in either simple (highway) or complex (city) simulated urban driving tasks using autonomous and manual driving modes. Then, we performed a matching exercise where participants could experience vibrotactile patterns from the back of the car seat and map them to the prior movements. Results: We report a summary of individual perceptions concerning different movements and vibrotactile patterns. Beside describing situations within a drive when it may be more likely to perform movement-based interventions, we also describe movements that may interfere with driving and those that may complement it well. Furthermore, we identify movements that could be conducive to a more relaxing commute and describe vibrotactile patterns that could guide such movements and exercises. We discuss implications for design such as the influence of driving modality on the adoption of movement, need for personal customization, the influence that social perception has on participants, and the potential role of prior awareness of mindful techniques in the adoption of new movement-based interventions. Conclusions: This exploratory study provides insights into which types of movements could be better suited to design mindful interventions to reduce stress for commuters, when to encourage such movements, and how best to guide them using noninvasive haptic stimuli embedded in the car seat.

To establish the psychometric properties of instruments to measure learning outcomes in healthcare students. Background. Meaningful learning is an active process that promotes a wider and deeper understanding of concepts. It is the result of an interaction between new and previous knowledge. Meaningful learning produces a long-term change in knowledge and skills, which is underpinned by willingness to learn and experience and it is exclusively built by the learner. Design. Systematic psychometric review protocol developed from Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care guidance. Method. Searches of MEDLINE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, ERIC, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Psychology & Behavioral Sciences Collection Database between 1990-2013. Selected studies will be evaluated with the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist. Funding for the review was confirmed on January 2011 by the Centre of Excellence for Nursing Scholarship in Rome. Results. The systematic review will produce a synthesis of the data related to the instruments that measure learning outcomes. These data will help us decide which tools to use and identify the state of knowledge in this field. Conclusions. Measuring learning outcomes is very important for the large amount of human and financial resources employed in educating and training health professionals and this requires reliable and valid instruments.

J	Fan, LL; Rao, H; Yang, WJ				Fan, Lili; Rao, Hong; Yang, Wenji			3D Hand Pose Estimation Based on Five-Layer Ensemble CNN	SENSORS			English	Article						hierarchical thinking; 3D hand pose estimation; RGB image; hand topology		Estimating accurate 3D hand pose from a single RGB image is a highly challenging problem in pose estimation due to self-geometric ambiguities, self-occlusions, and the absence of depth information. To this end, a novel Five-Layer Ensemble CNN (5LENet) is proposed based on hierarchical thinking, which is designed to decompose the hand pose estimation task into five single-finger pose estimation sub-tasks. Then, the sub-task estimation results are fused to estimate full 3D hand pose. The hierarchical method is of great benefit to extract deeper and better finger feature information, which can effectively improve the estimation accuracy of 3D hand pose. In addition, we also build a hand model with the center of the palm (represented as Palm) connected to the middle finger according to the topological structure of hand, which can further boost the performance of 3D hand pose estimation. Additionally, extensive quantitative and qualitative results on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of 5LENet, yielding new state-of-the-art 3D estimation accuracy, which is superior to most advanced estimation methods.

Setting: Independent pharmacy in eastern Tennessee. Practice description: The pharmacy offers medication reconciliation services via HIE access, as well as other clinical pharmacy services. The average number of prescriptions filled weekly is 1900, and staffing included 3.5 full-time-equivalent (FTE) pharmacists, and 7 FTE technicians. Practice innovation: HIE integration within the workflow of the pharmacy was used to enhance existing patient care services, such as medication distribution, drug use review, medication therapy management, and immunizations, as well as to implement a novel transitional care service. Evaluation: A mixed-methods design was used to explore HIE workflow. Data collection included a pharmacist and pharmacy technician perceptions survey, mapping steps involved in HIE use in workflow via a think-aloud protocol, and quantitatively reporting the number and type of discordant medications found on medication reconciliation. Results: In total, 25 patients qualified for the medication reconciliation intervention and data collection. All 25 patients (100%) had at least 1 discordant medication. HIE access was used for 60% of patients. Community pharmacists were confident in their abilities to perform medication reconciliation and were able to perform the medication reconciliation with the use of the HIE within their workflow, albeit with some reported barriers. The average time spent per patient for HIE-facilitated transitional care was 21 minutes. Conclusion: Integration and utilization of an HIE within the workflow for the purposes of patient care service delivery in the community pharmacy is feasible, but not without limitations. Such HIE utilization and extended access to the patient's clinical picture may represent a scalable method to enhance currently delivered pharmacist services.

J	Guo, W; Chen, XR; Liu, HC				Guo, Wei; Chen, Xin-Rong; Liu, Hu-Chen			Decision-Making under Uncertainty: How Easterners and Westerners Think Differently	BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES			English	Article						decision-making; uncertainty; preferences; ambiguity aversion; risk aversion; culture	TIGHTNESS-LOOSENESS; EXPECTED UTILITY; RISK-AVERSION; AMBIGUITY; BEHAVIOR; CULTURE; INFORMATION; AVOIDANCE; ATTITUDES; MODELS	It has long been known that Easterners exhibit more conservative attitudes, cautiousness behaviors, and self-control ability than Westerners; people in Eastern countries show stronger defensive reactions to societal threats than Western people. Are East Asians really risk averters or do some richer underlying preferences drive their behaviors in their decision-making under uncertainty? To answer this question, we examined the risk and ambiguity attitudes of East Asian populations in both gain and loss domains using classical behavioral economic experimental methods. Based on our sample of university students, we found that Easterners are more risk intolerant but more willing to accept ambiguous conditions than their Westerner counterparts in the gain domain. Perhaps surprisingly, Eastern people and Western people have a similar attitude toward risk and ambiguity in the loss domain. The higher level of risk aversion observed among East Asians may be due to the cultural difference between Western countries and Eastern countries. Historically, such risk aversion may make sense, because it would minimize the influence of numerous ecological and historical threats and socio-political practices. Our findings suggest that models that were designed to analyze and predict aggregate behaviors and markets may be ineffective for Eastern populations, and, in the future, it is of significance to develop appropriate representative agent models from the eastern perspective.

J	Durmaz, Y; Fidanog, A				Durmaz, Yakup; Fidanog, Ahmet			The mediating role of environmental knowledge in the effect of environmentally sensitive thoughts and behaviors on business performance: Practice in Turkey	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Environmental thinking; Environmental behavior; Environmental information; Environmental performance; Manufacturing enterprises	ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; PROENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR; SUPPLY CHAINS; GREEN; VARIABLES; COMPETITIVENESS; DETERMINANTS; CORPORATE; MOTIVATIONS	This research aims to investigate the mediating effect of environmental knowledge level on the effect of environmentally sensitive thoughts and behaviors on business performance. In the globalizing world, manufacturing enterprises are at the forefront in terms of their damage to the environment. It was conducted using the survey method on industrial enterprises operating in the organized industrial zone. The data obtained in the study were analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method. In the research, it is seen that environmentally sensitive thoughts and behaviors have a positive and significant effect on the environmental performance of enterprises. It has been observed that environmental knowledge has a mediating effect on the effect of environmentally sensitive thoughts and behavior on the environmental performance of enterprises. Environmentally sensitive thoughts and behaviors of manufacturing business managers will have a positive impact on the environmental performance of enterprises. It has been determined that the environmental performance of enterprises is mediated by the environmental information of managers. The research provides information about the impact of environmentally sensitive thoughts and behaviors on the environmental performance of the enterprise to industrial and industrial enterprise managers. As a designed model, it is expected to contribute to the literature.

Polish and US cross-country study of tacit knowledge sharing in IT	JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Tacit knowledge; Organizational learning; Innovations; Company culture; Critical thinking; Learning climate; Risk taking; Mistake acceptance	ERROR MANAGEMENT CULTURE; STATISTICAL CONTROL; ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION; PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY; FIT INDEXES; HEALTH-CARE; PERFORMANCE; ENTREPRENEURIAL; FAILURE; QUALITY	Purpose This study aims to understand and compare how the mechanism of innovative processes in the information technology (IT) industry - the most innovative industry worldwide - is shaped in Poland and the USA in terms of tacit knowledge awareness and sharing driven by a culture of knowledge and learning, composed of a learning climate and mistake acceptance. Design/methodology/approach Study samples were drawn from the IT industry in Poland (n = 350) and the USA (n = 370) and analyzed using the structural equation modeling method. Findings True learning derives from mistake acceptance. As a result of a risk-taking attitude and critical thinking, the IT industry in the USA is consistently innovation-oriented. Specifically, external innovations are highly correlated with internal innovations. Moreover, a knowledge culture supports a learning culture via a learning climate. A learning climate is an important facilitator for learning from mistakes. Originality/value This study revealed that a high level of mistake acceptance stimulates a risk-taking attitude that offers a high level of tacit knowledge awareness as a result of critical thinking, but critical thinking without readiness to take a risk is useless for tacit knowledge capturing.

J	Escalada-Hernández, P; Ruiz, NS; San Martín-Rodríguez, L				Escalada-Hernandez, Paula; Soto Ruiz, Nelia; San Martin-Rodriguez, Leticia			Design and evaluation of a prototype of augmented reality applied to medical devices	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Medical device; Augmented Reality; Medical Informatics Application; Mobile device		Background: According to current legislation, medical devices have to incorporate all the necessary information to eliminate or greatly minimise any problem associated with their use. However, the physical capacity of the actual device's packaging may frequently not be enough to contain all this information. To address this limitation, this study aimed to design and evaluate a prototype app for mobile devices applying augmented reality technology. The main feature of this kind of technology is combining virtual images with images from the real world. Methods: This work, carried out in Spain, was developed in three different phases. 1) Assessment of users' needs: Through a focus group and an online questionnaire, information was obtained about the following aspects: type of medical devices likely to be included in the app, relevant information that should be included and format in which this information should be presented. 2) Development of the prototype: Considering all the functional features identified in the previous phase, the software was developed by a team of professionals specialised in AR technology and applying a user-centred model. 3) Evaluation of the software: functionality and usability were assessed by means of the think-aloud method. Results: 1) Assessment of users' needs: a total of 11 nurses participated in the focus group and 280 healthcare professionals answered the questionnaire. Their findings showed that users consider that information about the following aspects of medical devices should be included in the app: instructions for use, indications for use, brief description of the device, special precautions and biocompatibility, image of the content with its components and meaning of icons. 2) Description of the prototype: Once the app has been launched, when the user scans the medical device with the mobile device camera, access to the home screen is activated, where three sections can be found: name of the medical device, image of the device and four icons which provide access to: a brief description of the device, a detailed description of it, the packaging iconography and a video about use of the device. 3) Evaluation of the software: the app was defined by users as "very intuitive". They highlighted, as one of its main positive aspects, the chance to obtain information about the medical device just by scanning the object. Additionally, the evaluation performed through the think-aloud method identified potential improvements in the app. These improvements were subsequently implemented to make the prototype more functional. Conclusion: Working with potential prototype users made it possible to identify information considered relevant for these users and to delve into the format which they consider more appropriate to show this information in the prototype. Our results show that AR technology can be used as support for clinical practice.

Cerebellum, Basal Ganglia, and Cortex Mediate Performance of an Aerial Pursuit Task	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neuroergonomics; fMRI; aviation; flying; affordance competition hypothesis; somatic marker hypothesis; universal cerebellar computation; dysmetria of thought	SMOOTH-PURSUIT; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MOTOR; MECHANISMS; THOUGHT; ACTIVATION; DYSMETRIA; ATTENTION; SELECTION; MOVEMENT	The affordance competition hypothesis is an ethologically inspired theory from cognitive neuroscience that provides an integrative neural account of continuous, real-time behavior, and will likely become increasingly relevant to the growing field of neuroergonomics. In the spirit of neuroergonomics in aviation, we designed a three-dimensional, first-person, continuous, and real-time fMRI task during which human subjects maneuvered a simulated airplane in pursuit of a target airplane along constantly changing headings. We introduce a pseudo-event-related, parametric fMRI analysis approach to begin testing the affordance competition hypothesis in neuroergonomic contexts, and attempt to identify regions of the brain that exhibit a linear metabolic relationship with the continuous variables of task performance and distance-from-target. In line with the affordance competition hypothesis, our results implicate the cooperation of the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and cortex in such a task, with greater involvement of the basal ganglia during good performance, and greater involvement of cortex and cerebellum during poor performance and when distance-from-target closes. We briefly review the somatic marker and dysmetria of thought hypotheses, in addition to the affordance competition hypothesis, to speculate on the intricacies of the cooperation of these brain regions in a task such as ours. In doing so, we demonstrate how the affordance competition hypothesis and other cognitive neuroscience theories are ready for testing in continuous, real-time tasks such as ours, and in other neuroergonomic settings more generally.

One is constantly aware of the amount of information/knowledge that is put at one's fingertips by the new communications and computing technologies. One of the central and most compelling applications for the 21(st) century is highly information based societies. E-learning is still being debated and researched and there is still much uncertainty about it in terms of what it means for culture, learning democracy, jobs, roles and society in general. Nevertheless, the growth of online or e-learning educational institutions has been phenomenal and it will continue to improve. Perhaps one of the most dramatic changes due to this phenomenon is the rapid convergence of computing, communications and indigenous content development initiatives. There is therefore a need to look at indigenous digital multimedia educational content development approaches that would meet the needs of indigenous community. This paper hopes to highlight the design of multimedia digital content based on the instructional and cognitive models thought suitable to create future knowledge workers (k-insan) in Malaysia. The paper shall also draw out in detail the characteristics of the k-insan and entities of the proposed indigenous content development initiatives based on the instructional and cognitive model approach with reference made to indigenous multimedia packages such as the ME, ME2 and MEL.

As a result, some people think travelling to distant and isolated locations during odd hours generates new threats to women's safety. The exponential increase in assaults and attacks on women, on the other hand, is posing a threat to women's growth, development, and security. At the time of the attack, it appears the women were immobilized and needed immediate support. Only self-defense isn't sufficient against abuse; a new technological solution is desired and can be used as quickly as hitting a switch or button. The proposed Women Safety Gadget (WSG) aims to design a wearable safety device model based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cloud Technology. It is designed in three layers, namely layer-1, having an android app; layer-2, with messaging and location tracking system; and layer -3, which updates information in the cloud database. WSG can detect an unsafe condition by the pressure sensor of the finger on the artificial nail, consequently diffuses a pepper spray, and automatically notifies the saved closest contacts and police station through messaging and location settings. WSG has a response time of 1000 ms once the nail is pressed; the average time for pulse rate measure is 0.475 s, and diffusing the pepper spray is 0.2-0.5 s. The average activation time is 2.079 s.

The Fear of Birth Scale has been proposed as a valid measure suitable for assessing fear of birth in an antenatal clinical context. To make sure that the scale makes sense in relation to the known constructs of fear of birth, it is important to find out what women think when responding to the Fear of Birth Scale. Aim: To report what women in mid-pregnancy think when assessing fear of birth on the Fear of Birth Scale. Methods: A qualitative design using semi-structured interviews with a think aloud technique was used. Thirty-one women were recruited in gestational week 17-20. Content analysis was conducted to describe the different dimensions of fear of birth. Findings: Worry was described as unspecific feelings and thoughts, often with a negative loading. Fear was described as a strong feeling connected to something specific. Furthermore, the women thought about aspects that influence their worries and fears and explained the strategies that helped them to cope with their fear of birth. Conclusion: Women could clearly assess, describe, and discuss fear of birth using the Fear of Birth Scale. This supports the use of the Fear of Birth Scale in clinical settings as a starting point for further dialogue about women's fear of birth. The dialogue may identify women's need for information, treatment, and referral when necessary. (C) 2015 Australian College of Midwives. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hauck, RV; Weisband, S				Hauck, RV; Weisband, S			When a better interface and easy navigation aren't enough: Examining the information architecture in a law enforcement agency	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SYSTEMS	An information architecture that allows users to easily navigate through a system and quickly recover from mistakes is often defined as a highly usable system. But usability in systems design goes beyond a good interface and efficient navigation. In this article we describe two database systems in a law enforcement agency. One system is a legacy, text-based system with cumbersome navigation (RMS); the newer system is a graphical user interface with simplified navigation (CopNet). It is hypothesized that law enforcement users will evaluate CopNet higher than RMS, but experts of the older system will evaluate it higher than others will. We conducted two user studies. One study examined what users thought of RMS and CopNet, and compared RMS experts' evaluations with nonexperts. We found that all users evaluated CopNet as more effective, easier to use, and easier to navigate than RMS, and this was especially noticeable for users who were not experts with the older system. The second, follow-up study examined use behavior after CopNet was deployed some time later. The findings revealed that evaluations of CopNet were not associated with its use. If the newer system had a better interface and was easier to navigate than the older, legacy system, why were law enforcement personnel reluctant to switch? We discuss reasons why switching to a new system is difficult, especially for those who are most adept at using the older system. Implications for system design and usability are also discussed.

J	Dong, YF; Huo, LA; Xie, XX; Li, M				Dong, Yafang; Huo, Liang'an; Xie, Xiaoxiao; Li, Ming			An improved ISR-WV rumor propagation model based on multichannels with time delay and pulse vaccination	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						rumor propagation; propagation channels; pulse vaccination control; time delay; information base	SPREADING MODEL; ONLINE; MEDIA	The rapid development of the Internet has broadened the channels of dissemination of information, it has also led to the rapid and widespread propagation of rumors, which can have a serious negative impact socially. In this paper, an improved ISR-WV rumor propagation model integrating multichannels is proposed by considering the system's time delay, and the influence of different channels of propagation on the dynamic process is further analyzed. Moreover, the basic reproduction number R (0), rumor-free equilibrium, and rumor-prevailing equilibrium, as well as their stability, are deduced. Then, an optimal control problem with pulse vaccination is designed. Finally, the validity of the model and theoretical results is verified by numerical simulations and a practical application. The results show that the rumor propagation threshold R (0) is more sensitive to the rate of the propagation of the information base channel. The shorter the thinking time & tau; (1) required for the ignorant to react after obtaining the information, the larger the final scale of propagation. Under this condition, the time delay & tau; (2) spent by a spreader in producing a video is negatively related to the final scale of the propagation; conversely, a longer & tau; (1) implies that the person tends to more cognizant, which can suppress the spread of rumors.

J	Wang, BL; Liang, JY; Yao, YY				Wang, Baoli; Liang, Jiye; Yao, Yiyu			A trilevel analysis of uncertainty measuresin partition-based granular computing	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						Trilevel thinking; Three-way decision; Partition-based granular computing; Uncertainty measure; Complexity measure	3-WAY DECISION; KNOWLEDGE GRANULATION; ROUGH SETS; CONDITIONAL ENTROPY; INFORMATION ENTROPY; INCLUSION DEGREE; DISTANCE; SYSTEMS; OPERATORS; MODEL	Uncertainty measure is one of the most significant concepts and fundamental issues in granular computing. Nowadays, there have been extensive studies on various uncertainty measures for quantifying diverse properties and associations of granules and granular structures. However, there is a lack of a systematic study for uncertain measures. Based on a trilevel thinking framework, this paper presents a systematic review and analysis of uncertainty measures used in partition-based models of granular computing. At an object level, a granule level and a granular structure level, we categorize uncertainty measures for describing the properties and the associations of objects, granules, and partitions respectively. Moreover, we illustrate how to construct an uncertainty measure at a higher level from a lower level. At last, we discuss several potential directions to design other new uncertainty measures for partition-based granular computing.

STEM education has evolved into a metadiscipline, which involves an integrated effort to eliminate the traditional barriers between different subjects. Recent studies have reported increased levels of STEM education in international science education at the preliminary education stage worldwide. However, STEM assessment studies have lacked systematic and comprehensive assessment standards. Therefore, this study included a series of pretest and posttest evaluation questionnaires. With multiple evaluation methods, this study analyzed the effects of the STEM courses. This paper assesses the effect of the STEM courses on a total of 693 students of a primary school in Beijing. The results can be used to establish a more systematic and perfect evaluation system for students' interdisciplinary learning ability. STEM courses have achieved certain positive effects on emotional attitudes toward STEM, subject cognition, engineering professional cognition and engineering design ability among the three grade students, particularly for middle-school students.

Players take the role of scientists, involved in a research to find out which pathogen causes this pandemic and which could be the best way to solve it. Students have the opportunity to use BLAST software as a scientific bioinformatic tool to discover the main game' enigmas. The activity uses game-based science learning methodology. This methodology incorporates multiple tools and resources, rely on learning by doing, guiding learners through a path of events and into a way of thinking. It provides students to take information from many sources and make decisions, to deduce a game's obstacles, to understand complex systems and to collaborate with other classmates. The activity has been developed for a range of audiences, including high school students and pre-service teachers. A case study has been carried out with a group of 80 primary pre-service teachers from the Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV) in Tarragona (Spain) in order to verify whether this activity was well designed, engage students and it is satisfactorily implemented.

The studies cover (1) current and potential benefits of bio-based products in extended value chains including activities after end-of-life of products, (2) value communication between stakeholders in extended value chains, and (3) creating an integrated development approach for optimized bio-based products. Most existing models for value chains were found to be one-way single-flow models to which iterations and interactions have been added to obtain realistic representations of best practices. Interviews of thirteen professionals clarified some barriers between the current implementation of bio-based plastics and the ideal sustainable value chain fulfilment. The most noticeable barriers included trustful information sharing, information and knowledge gaps, sub-optimum application of bio-based plastics, and the need for facilitating product design. The main designers' needs are increased integrated literacy related to bio-based materials, eco-effectiveness and a more effective communication competence in value chains. Based on all findings, six approaches of design tasks integration into value chains have been proposed. These approaches encourage designers to think and act widely across value chains and particularly help implement life cycle thinking to achieve profitable sustainability.

To characterize and compare neuronal activity in two sectors of the lPFC [dorsal (dlPFC) and ventral (vlPFC)] and the PMd, we designed a behavioral task for monkeys to explore the differences in their participation in four aspects of information processing: encoding of visual signals, behavioral goal retrieval, action specification, and maintenance of relevant information. We initially presented a visual object (an instruction cue) to instruct a behavioral goal (reaching to the right or left of potential targets). After a subsequent delay, a choice cue appeared at various locations on a screen, and the animals could specify an action to achieve the behavioral goal. We found that vlPFC neurons amply encoded object features of the instruction cues for behavioral goal retrieval and, subsequently, spatial locations of the choice cues for specifying the actions. By contrast, dlPFC and PMd neurons rarely encoded the object features, although they reflected the behavioral goals throughout the delay period. After the appearance of the choice cues, the PMd held information for action throughout the specification and preparation of reaching movements. Remarkably, lPFC neurons represented information for the behavioral goal continuously, even after the action specification as well as during its execution. These results indicate that area-specific representation and information processing at progressive stages of the perception-action transformation in these areas underlie goal-directed behavior.

Lack of falsification and knowledge contestation in IS theories, methods, and practices	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Review						Prof; Frantz Rowe; Prof; Frantz Rowe; Methodology; epistemology; falsification; philosophy of science; scientometric research; machine learning	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS RESEARCH; USER ACCEPTANCE; TECHNOLOGY; PARADIGM; FIELD; MIS; ADAPTATION; PHILOSOPHY; CRITIQUE; MODELS	Among the defining characteristics of a healthy research discipline is the ability to correct its knowledge if more recent evidence creates grounds for this. Studies that reveal errors in earlier theories demonstrate, in line with Karl Popper's thinking, an approach called falsificationism. They complement approaches aimed at developing and expanding knowledge by generalising empirical observations or postulating new contributions and testing them. The paper presents an analysis that applies this categorisation to abstracts of research papers (N = 5,202) in the eight leading IS journals. Machine-learning-based classification determined that only 7.0% of the papers manifested any clear form of knowledge-contestation, such as falsification, in the approach or findings presented. In light of this, we call on IS researchers to increase the falsification and knowledge-contestation in their research, to nurture more valid theories, methods, and practices, thereby achieving greater societal impact. We present two suitable IS research designs accordingly: knowledge-contesting comparisons and knowledge-contesting replications. We also discuss how these designs, exemplifying opportunities to increase the number of knowledge-contesting studies in the field, can be applied in both positivist and interpretivist research epistemology.

J	Montesi, M				Montesi, Michela			Genre analysis of bookmarked webpages	ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW			English	Article						Worldwide web; Information retrieval	OF-THE-LITERATURE; RELEVANCE CRITERIA; INFORMATION-SCIENCE; USERS; FRAMEWORK; THINKING; NOTION	Purpose - A total of 17 user-compiled collections of webpages, comprising 833 bookmarked links in terms of genre, are studied. The purpose of this paper is to find out whether users tend to bookmark certain web genres more than others. Genre theory helps to make sense of the different pages included in these collections, and to classify them, according to their communicative purpose and salient non-topical features, into blogs, search interfaces, articles, tutorials. Design/methodology/approach A total of 17 participants took part in the research by providing their collections of bookmark links. They were also interviewed about the reasons for bookmarking and to comment on their collections. Relying on the interview results and on the previous literature, the bookmarks were classified into four super-genres: main or access pages, transactional pages, navigational pages, and content pages. Findings The results of the classification into web genres revealed a clear tendency to bookmark main pages, such as homepages, which accounted for 42 per cent of all bookmarked web links. Moreover, some aspects of relevance were highlighted such as the connections to use, time, and context, as well as to the main web activity (browsing or searching). Originality/value Previously, bookmarks have mostly been studied as tools for information reuse, but very rarely as sources of implicit relevance feedback. In addition, from the point of view of genre theory, this research shows the importance of relating web genres to users' intentions behind queries.

The general structure of these compounds can be categorized into two basic structural families: acceptor/donor/donor/acceptor and donor/ bridge/acceptor. This study attempts to determine certain molecular structure/effective two-photon absorption relationships by careful characterization and as a function of systematically varied changes in the organic structure of the dye molecules. Such information can be useful in the design of more efficient two-photon dyes for imaging and power-limiting applications. The results of the study indicate that with the incorporation of certain combinations of structural elements, dyes can be synthesized which have greatly increased effective cross sections as high as 152.5 x 10(-48) cm(4) s/photon molecule in benzene solution at 800 nm using 8 ns pulses. This value is orders of magnitude higher than commercially available organic dyes measured at the same wavelength. Although the process is thought to involve a combination of two-photon absorption and excited state absorption phenomena, the information gathered from these new families of dyes has provided an important first step in producing improved materials for use in many different two-photon technology application.

Service-oriented technology and management: Perspectives on research and practice for the coming decade	ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electronic Commerce	AUG 21, 2007	Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN		Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management	Business processes; Economic analysis; IT management; Research directions; Service-oriented architecture; Service paradigm; Service-oriented technology and management; Thought leadership	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; WEB SERVICES; REAL OPTIONS; RISK-MANAGEMENT; INTERORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS; RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS; AT-RISK; BUSINESS; INVESTMENT; MODEL	Service-oriented technologies and management have gained attention in the past few years, promising a way to create the basis for agility so that companies can deliver new, more flexible business processes that harness the value of the services approach from a customer's perspective. Service-oriented approaches are used for developing software applications and software-as-a-service that can be sourced as virtual hardware resources, including on-demand and utility computing. The driving forces come from the software engineering community and the e-business community. Service-oriented architecture promotes the loose coupling of software components so that interoperability across programming languages and platforms, and dynamic choreography of business processes can be achieved. Nevertheless, one of today's most pervasive and perplexing challenges for senior managers deals with how and when to make a commitment to the new practices. The purpose of this article is to shed light on multiple issues associated with service-oriented technologies and management by examining several interrelated questions: why is it appropriate now to study the related business problems from the point of view of services research? What new conceptual frameworks and theoretical perspectives are appropriate for studying service-oriented technologies and management? What value will a service science and business process modeling offer to the firms that adopt them? And, how can these approaches be implemented so as to address the major challenges that organizations face with technology, information and strategy? We contribute new knowledge in this area by tying the economics and information technology strategy perspectives to the semantic and design science perspectives for a broader audience. Usually the more technical perspective is offered on a standalone basis, and confined to the systems space - even when the discussion is about business processes. This article also offers insights on these issues from the multiple perspectives of industry and academic thought leaders. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B. V.

We believe that there is currently great potential to improve study quality and interpretabilityby reducing the amount of missing data through changes in trial design and conduct and by planning and conducting analyses that better account for the missing information. Here, we describe our view on some of the recommendations in the report and suggest ways in which these recommendations can be incorporated into new or ongoing clinical trials in order to improve their chance of success.

BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article						Human rights; Maternal health; Dignity	QUALITY-OF-CARE; PATIENT AUTONOMY; RURAL TANZANIA; HEALTH-CARE; DIGNITY; ABUSE; CHILDBIRTH; EXPERIENCES; DISRESPECT; DELIVERY	Background: A human rights approach to maternal health is considered as a useful framework in international efforts to reduce maternal mortality. Although fundamental human rights principles are incorporated into legal and medical frameworks, human rights have to be translated into measurable actions and outcomes. So far, their substantive applications remain unclear. The aim of this study is to explore women's perspectives and experiences of maternal health services through a human rights perspective in Magu District, Tanzania. Methods: This study is a qualitative exploration of perspectives and experiences of women regarding maternity services in government health facilities. The point of departure is a Human Rights perspective. A total of 36 semi-structured interviews were held with 17 women, between the age of 31 and 63, supplemented with one focus group discussion of a selection of the interviewed women, in three rural villages and the town centre in Magu District. Data analysis was performed using a coding scheme based on four human rights principles: dignity, autonomy, equality and safety. Results: Women's experiences of maternal health services reflect several sub-standard care factors relating to violations of multiple human rights principles. Women were aware that substandard care was present and described a range of ways how the services could be delivered that would venerate human rights principles. Prominent themes included: 'being treated well and equal', 'being respected' and 'being given the appropriate information and medical treatment'. Conclusion: Women in this rural Tanzanian setting are aware that their experiences of maternity care reflect violations of their basic rights and are able to voice what basic human rights principles mean to them as well as their desired applications in maternal health service provision.

MedScrab, a gamification-based mHealth app, is the first attempt to deliver crucial life-saving medication information to patients and increase their medication adherence. The paper presents the development of MedScrab and a two-phase mixed-method usability evaluation of MedScrab. Phase I qualitatively evaluated MedScrab using a think-aloud protocol for its usability. With 51 participants, qualitative data analysis of Phase I revealed two themes: positive functionality of the app and four areas of improvement. The improvement recommendations were incorporated into MedScrab's design. Phase I also validated a widely used mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ). Quantitative data analysis of Phase I reduced the original 18-item MAUQ scale to a 15-item scale with two factors: ease of use (4 items) and usefulness and satisfaction (11 items). Phase II surveyed 83 participants from Amazon's Mechanical Turk using a modified MAUQ. The modified MAUQ scale showed strong internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.959) and high factor loadings (between 0.623 and 0.987). The study design of the usability evaluation can serve as a methodological guide for designing, evaluating, and improving mHealth apps. The usability study showed that MedScrab was perceived as ease of use (6.24 out of 7) with high usefulness and satisfaction (5.72 out of 7). The quantitative data analysis results support the use of the modified MAUQ as a valid instrument to measure the usability of the MedScrab. However, the instrument should be used with adaptation based on the app's characteristics.

Thus, the aims were to replicate the framing of the production outcome investigated in previous studies; to ascertain the impact of the accuracy of information about audit probabilities; and to determine whether the amount of violations increases just after an audit has been experienced (bomb crater effect). The research questions were experimentally investigated using a 2 x 3 design with the factors framing (gain, loss) and accuracy of information about audit probabilities (no, vague or precise information). The participants (n = 148) were required to put themselves in the role of a control room operator of a waste water treatment plant (WaTrSim-Annual). They had to choose whether to start up the plant using the prescribed safe but non-profitable procedure (compliance) or to apply the profitable but unsafe and therefore forbidden start-up procedure (rule violation). Participants violated the rule significantly more frequently when the production outcome was loss-framed. Furthermore, it was shown that precise information about audit probabilities led to significantly more rule violations than only vague or no information about audit probabilities. The data analysis additionally revealed that participants tend to violate a safety-related rule significantly more often if they have just experienced a safety audit (bomb crater effect). To prevent rule violations, it should be avoided that people (1) think that they are not reaching their objectives (as is suggested by a loss-framed depiction of the production outcomes), and (2) receive precise information about audit probabilities. Furthermore, in order to reduce the violation rate directly after an audit, it is recommendable to occasionally conduct two consecutive audits to demonstrate that audits may occur in quick succession.

In this paper, we use the US patent citation network (1926-2010) to test our ability to early identify a list of expert-selected historically significant patents through citation network analysis. We show that in order to effectively uncover these patents shortly after they are issued, we need to go beyond raw citation counts and take into account both the citation network topology and temporal information. In particular, an age-normalized measure of patent centrality, called rescaled PageRank, allows us to identify the significant patents earlier than citation count and PageRank score. In addition, we find that while high-impact patents tend to rely on other high-impact patents in a similar way as scientific papers, the patents' citation dynamics is significantly slower than that of papers, which makes the early identification of significant patents more challenging than that of significant papers. In the context of technology management, our resealed metrics can be useful to early detect recent trends in technical improvement, which is of fundamental interest for companies and investors.

ADDICTION RESEARCH & THEORY			English	Article						Responsible gambling; public health; messaging; focus groups; qualitative research	WARNING MESSAGES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; HARM; PREVENT; IMPACT	Safer gambling messages are a common public health intervention for gambling, and yet there is little evidence to support the variety of messages that are in widespread use. This paper thematically analyzed the perspectives of 21 participants - including academics, regulators and treatment providers - regarding the design characteristics of safer-gambling messages with the goal to improve on those already being used. The focus groups were semi-structured and discussed exemplar messages based on five areas of previous gambling research: teaching safer gambling practices, correcting gambling misperceptions, boosting conscious decision making, norm-based messages, and emotional messages. Five themes were supported by the three focus groups, including that messages: may be insufficient to change behavior; should respect the diversity amongst gamblers; should not contribute to gambling stigma; should provide norm-based information thoughtfully; and should trigger only positive and not negative emotions. These findings can be useful in developing messages that are based on themes endorsed by experts as being relevant to the design of effective safer-gambling messages. Generating a pool of messages that are evidence based is likely to improve on current messages, thus serving as a useful public health tool for promoting safer-gambling involvement.

This article identifies where such censure is valid, but proceeds to argue that the rationale underlying economic techniques is at fault, rather than the techniques themselves. Within the rural context, we suggest that economics can make a valuable contribution to the design and achievement of sustainable ways of living. Valid criticism of economics focuses on its assumptions about value, since this has led to emphasis of favourable effects of markets, and laissez-faire. Policies exposing rural areas to more rigorously competitive market conditions encourage their transformation by increasing mechanisation, industrialisation and a less sustainable use of resources. New approaches and policies are required if different outcomes are to be achieved. An initial step is to identify desirable outcomes, a matter of social choice. However, society makes multiple demands on rural resources, and such issues cannot be adequately captured within a neo-classical welfare model. An alternative, hierarchical framework in the tradition of systems thinking, capable of analysing the complex relations associated with rural resource use, provides appropriate emphasis to the economic links between goals at different levels within the system, and appears to have some heuristic value. An empirical counterpart of the hierarchical framework, input-output analysis, generates information to support social choices and can also contribute to the understanding of economic systems and their interaction with the wider social, cultural, ethical and environmental universe. The article concludes with some revised economic policy prescriptions to promote rural sustainability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Each step of the forging process is thought of as a combination of feature eliminating processes. Depending on the above, the authors have developed a CAD system to design forging sequences and die profiles. The system designs the forging sequences and die profiles from the product to its raw material by eliminating features, which is the inverse of forging processes. First, the system detects features from a product's shape. A shape is represented by its cross-section including the axis with free curves. Its outline is described as successive finite vectors. The system extracts features by using the change of the vector direction. Second, the system searches a database of "manufacturing cases" using features such as search keys to find a candidate case in which the manufacturing process can be applied to the product. A manufacturing case is a data set having three kinds of data; search key, validity checking procedure of itself, and eliminating the procedure to get a partial preform after the elimination of the feature. Search key is the name of the feature to which a case can be applied. If the system finds a matched case by using the search key, it applies a validity checking procedure described in the matched case data. Please note that, by only eliminating features it is not possible to obtained a process plan. Each case must represent an actual forging method by which the feature can be manufactured. The validity checking procedure ensures that the eliminating process is actually to be realized as the inverse of forging. The system checks if the case can be applied on the feature or not by the validity checking procedure. If it passes, it eliminates the feature by the eliminating procedure described in the case. The procedures in each case are independent, but they exchange information about the cases and dimensions by using a working memory like a blackboard. Using the working memory, the system combines eliminating procedures automatically to get an actual manufacturing process. Thus, the system designs one forging process and preform, and after then, it also does the internal profiles of dies and exports them as point line into general purpose CAD systems. Repeating the above procedures, the system generates process plans and die profile design from the product's shape to its raw materials. Multiple plans and profiles are designed by repeating the procedure recursively. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Smartphones are increasingly being used by young Indigenous adults and therefore represent a promising method to engage them in programs seeking to improve nutritional intake. Objective: This study aimed to consult RIC members to inform the content of a smartphone app that can be used to monitor and reduce sugar-sweetened beverage intake in RICs. Methods: The study was conducted in two phases. The formative phase involved a simulated grocery selection activity with think aloud ("think aloud shop"), a semistructured interview, a questionnaire outlining current smartphone and app use, and a paper prototyping activity. A preliminary end-user testing phase involved a think aloud prototype test and a semistructured interview regarding user satisfaction. Convenience sampling was used to recruit 20 18-to 35-year-old smartphone users for each phase from two RICs in the Northern Territory, Australia. Thematic analysis of transcribed audio recordings was used to identify determinants of food choice from the think aloud shop; themes related to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) from the eating behaviors interview; and usability, comprehension, and satisfaction with the app from the preliminary end-user testing. Results: Smartphone use in RICs is currently different to that found in urban environments; in particular, extremely low use of Facebook, restricted variety of phone types, and limited Internet access. Findings regarding promoting app engagement indicate that utilizing an opt-in approach to social features such as leader boards and team challenges is essential. The inclusion of games was also shown to be important for satisfaction, as were the use of audio features, contextually embedded dissemination, and streamlined app design for comprehension in this target group. Conclusions: This research provides critical insights and concrete recommendations for the development of lifestyle improvement apps targeted toward disadvantaged young adults in nonurban settings, specifically RICs. It serves as a framework for future app development projects using a consultative user-centered design approach, supporting calls for the increased use of this strategy in app development.

To improve the creativity of crowdsourcing outcomes, researchers have proposed multiple approaches to support crowd workers' idea proposal step. Other steps in designers' creative process, such as information gathering and reflective activity, also impact idea creativity, while their effects in crowdsourcing scenarios remain unexplored. Therefore, referring to the creativity research, this study proposed an approach that optimized crowdsourcing tasks to help crowd workers perform information gathering and reflective activity. Two experiments involving 427 workers were conducted to test the effects of our approach. Results showed that instructing crowd workers to gather information and reflect on their ideas positively affected the creativity of crowdsourcing outcomes. This study provides inspiration for the optimization of crowdsourcing tasks and offers insights to the researchers who focus on using crowd power to achieve the ideation process.

Text comprehension and the computational mind-agencies	NATURAL COMPUTING			English	Article						Society of mind; Thinking machines; Reflective cognitive architecture; Concept-granulation; Natural computation; Artificial general intelligence	FUZZY-LOGIC; MEMORY; INFORMATION; CONSTRUCTION; CURIOSITY; SYSTEM; MAPS	Guided by a polymath approach-encompassing neuroscience, philosophy, psychology and computer science, this article describes a novel 'cognitive' computational mind framework for text comprehension in terms of Minsky's 'Society of Mind' and 'Emotion Machine' theories. Observing a top-down design method, we enumerate here the macrocosmic elements of the model-the 'agencies' and memory constructs, followed by an elucidation on the working principles and synthesis concerns. Besides corroboration of results of a dry-run test by thoughts generated by random human subjects; the completeness of the conceptualized framework has been validated as a consequence of its total representation of 'text understanding' functions of the human brain, types of human memory and emulation of the layers of the mind. A brief conceptual comparison, between the architecture and existing 'conscious' agents, has been included as well. The framework, though observed here in its capacity as a text comprehender, is capable of understanding in general. A cognitive model of text comprehension, besides contributing to the 'thinking machines' research enterprise, is envisioned to be strategic in the design of intelligent plagiarism checkers, literature genre-cataloguers, differential diagnosis systems, and educational aids for children with reading disorders. Turing's landmark 1950 article on computational intelligence is the principal motivator behind our research initiative.

Design of a very large chemical sensor system for mimicking biological olfaction	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL			English	Article						Electronic nose; Sensor array; Conductive polymers; Inkjet printing	FILM; TRANSISTORS; MATRIX	Olfactory receptor neurons in the mammalian olfactory system transduce the odour information into electrical signals and project these into the olfactory bulb. In the biological system the huge redundancy and the massive convergence of the olfactory receptor neurons to the olfactory bulb are thought to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of the system. To explore this concept a polymeric chemical sensor array consisting of 2(16) (65,536) sensors comprising tens of different types will be built in the frame of the FP7 NEUROCHEM project. To interface such a large sensor array, a topological array configuration with n rows and m columns has been adopted in order to reduce the total wiring connections to n + m. A detailed numerical analysis of the electrical crosstalk deriving from such a configuration has been carried out for elucidating advantages and limitations of the scanning algorithm. A prototype of the transducing array has been designed and an electronic scanning system capable of reading the 65,536 sensing elements array has been realized. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

According to the mainstream normative account the acknowledgments serve to repay debts towards formal or informal collaborators. According to the strategic account, by contrast, the acknowledgments serve to increase the perceived quality of papers by associating the authors to influential scholars. The two accounts are assessed by analyzing the acknowledgments indexed in Web of Science of 1218 articles published in the "top-five journals" of economics for the years 2015-2019. The analysis is focused on six dimensions: (i) the style of acknowledging texts, (ii) the distribution of mentions, (iii) the identity of the most mentioned acknowledgees, (iv) the shares of highly and lowly mentioned acknowledgees, (v) the hierarchy of the acknowledgment network, and (vi) the correlation at a paper level between intellectual similarity, measured by common references, and social similarity, measured by common acknowledges. Results show that the normative and the strategic account should be considered as valid but partial explanations of acknowledging behavior. Hence, acknowledgments should be used with extreme caution for investigating collaboration practices and they should not be used to produce acknowledgments-based metrics of scholars for evaluative purposes.

J	Goede, R				Goede, Roelien			Sustainable business intelligence systems: Modelling for the future	SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE			English	Article						business intelligence systems; critical systems thinking; data vault modelling; key success factors; sustainable information systems	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS	Business intelligence systems are used in support of strategic decision-making in organisations. Strategic decisions in support of the sustainable development goals require accurate and accessible data. Of equal importance is the sustainability of the business information systems themselves. Not only should they be sensitive to resource consumption but they should also be designed for the future needs of the organisation. We argue that sustainable business intelligence systems should represent as many perspectives in the organisation as possible supported by the available data. In order to achieve this, a critical (Kantian) systems perspective is suggested that foster appreciation of different perspectives in the organisation. Prevailing belief in the business intelligence system industry is that a key business problem should drive development of the system. Our position is more future oriented in that we argue that inclusion of all available perspectives on business problems will prolong the life of the system, thereby making it more sustainable. This is not an idealistic requirement when a data vault is used for the data model of the system. Contrary to the more common dimensional modelling, data vault modelling does not require restrictive decisions to be made on the scope of the system. In fact, the worst-case scenario is addressed in the initial model. The paper provides a conceptual discussion of how a business intelligence system should be designed and developed to ensure that it is sustainable. Since the right system should be developed in the right way, we incorporate known success factors into our discussion. We argue that the critical (Kantian) systems perspective can lead to the right system and that data vault modelling in context of lessons from identified success factors is the right way to develop the business intelligence system.

In this work, we propose a computational strategy to design novel inhibitors of coronavirus main protease, M-pro. The pipeline integrates publicly available screening and binding affinity data in a two-stage machine-learning model using the recent MACAW embeddings. Once trained, the model can be deployed to rapidly screen large libraries of molecules in silico. Several hundred thousand compounds were virtually screened and 10 of them were selected for experimental testing. From these 10 compounds, 8 showed a clear inhibitory effect on recombinant M-pro, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration values (IC50) in the range 0.18-18.82 mu M. Cellular assays were also conducted to evaluate cytotoxic, haemolytic, and antiviral properties. A promising lead compound against coronavirus M-pro was identified with dose-dependent inhibition of virus infectivity and minimal toxicity on human MRC-5 cells.

E. curvula constitutes a polymorphic complex that includes cytotypes with different ploidy levels (from 2x to 8x), where most polyploids are facultative apomicts, although both sexual reproduction and full apomixis have been reported in this species. Apomixis is thought to be associated with silencing of the sexual pathway, which would involve epigenetic mechanisms. However, a correlation between small RNAs and apomixis has not yet been conclusively established. Results Aiming to contribute to the elucidation of their role in the expression of apomixis, we constructed small RNA libraries from sexual and apomictic E. curvula genotypes via Illumina technology, characterized the small RNA populations, and conducted differential expression analysis by comparing these small RNAs with the E. curvula reference transcriptome. We found that the expression of two genes is repressed in the sexual genotype, which is associated with specific microRNA expression. Conclusion Our results support the hypothesis that in E. curvula the expression of apomixis leads to sexual repression.

Thinking About the Future: A Review of Prognostic Scales Used in Acute Stroke	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						stroke; functional outcome; prognostic scale; risk score; validation	ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; TOTALED HEALTH-RISKS; THROMBOLYTIC PREDICTIVE INSTRUMENT; VASCULAR EVENTS SCORE; SYMPTOMATIC INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE; TISSUE-PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR; EXTERNAL VALIDATION; THRIVE SCORE; SOAR STROKE; INTRAVENOUS THROMBOLYSIS	Background: There are many prognostic scales that aim to predict functional outcome following acute stroke. Despite considerable research interest, these scales have had limited impact in routine clinical practice. This may be due to perceived problems with internal validity (quality of research), as well as external validity (generalizability of results). We set out to collate information on exemplar stroke prognosis scales, giving particular attention to the scale content, derivation, and validation. Methods: We performed a focused literature search, designed to return high profile scales that use baseline clinical data to predict mortality or disability. We described prognostic utility and collated information on the content, development and validation of the tools. We critically appraised chosen scales based on the CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modeling Studies (CHARMS). Results: We chose 10 primary scales that met our inclusion criteria, six of which had revised/modified versions. Most primary scales used 5 input variables (range: 4-13), with substantial overlap in the variables included. All scales included age, eight included a measure of stroke severity, while five scales incorporated pre-stroke level of function (often using modified Rankin Scale), comorbidities and classification of stroke type. Through our critical appraisal, we found issues relating to excluding patients with missing data from derivation studies, and basing the selection of model variable on significance in univariable analysis (in both cases noted for six studies). We identified separate external validation studies for all primary scales but one, with a total of 60 validation studies. Conclusions: Most acute stroke prognosis scales use similar variables to predict long-term outcomes and most have reasonable prognostic accuracy. While not all published scales followed best practice in development, most have been subsequently validated. Lack of clinical uptake may relate more to practical application of scales rather than validity. Impact studies are now necessary to investigate clinical usefulness of existing scales.

STEAM education aims to cultivate students' ability to solve such problems through interdisciplinary thinking but is often represented by courses that are merely disjointed arrays of school subjects. On the other hand, Maker education harnesses society's enthusiasm for technological innovation and creativity but overlooks the scientific principles that underpin these processes. This research presents a novel elementary school course informed by the interdisciplinary principles of STEAM, integrated with Maker's focus on technology and creativity. The course design also utilized engineering design as a meta-thematic framework. A total of 164 third-grade pupils participated in the research, with responses analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. The findings indicated that the integrated design of the course promoted pupils' learning motivation, self-efficacy, and acquisition of interdisciplinary knowledge. These effects were not gender-specific and demonstrate the potential applicability of a STEAM/Maker integrated approach to curriculum design in other settings.

J	Legault, C; Morgan, TM				Legault, C; Morgan, TM			Analyzing multiple end points with a two-stage design in clinical trials	COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS			English	Article						multiplicity; multivariate; multiple outcomes	ENDPOINTS	In many clinical trials, the assessment of the response to interventions can include a large variety of outcome variables which are generally correlated. The use of multiple significance tests is likely to increase the chance of detecting a difference in at least one of the outcomes between two treatments. Furthermore, univariate tests do not take into account the correlation structure. A new test is proposed that uses information from the interim analysis in a two-stage design to form the rejection region boundaries at the second stage. Initially, the test uses Hotelling's T-2 at the end of the first stage allowing only. for early acceptance of the null hypothesis and an O'Brien 'type' procedure at the end of the second stage. This test allows one to 'cheat' and look at the data at the interim analysis to form rejection regions at the second stage, provided one uses the correct distribution of the final test statistic. This distribution is derived and the power of the new test is compared to the power of three common procedures for testing multiple outcomes: Bonferroni's inequality, Hotelling's T-2 and O'Brien's test. O'Brien's test has the best power to detect a difference when the outcomes are thought to be affected in exactly the same direction and the same magnitude or in exactly the same relative effects as those proposed prior to data collection. However, the statistic is not robust to deviations in the alternative parameters proposed a priori, especially for correlated outcomes. The proposed new statistic and the derivation of its distribution allows investigators to consider information from the first stage of a two-stage design and consequently base the final test on the direction observed at the first stage or modify the statistic if the direction differs significantly from what was expected a priori.

Computer courses entail abstract notions and algorithmic features, and these difficulties affect the students' motivation. A problem-based learning serious game framework named Immersivio was designed. The researchers designed a quantitative study with a between subject design and implemented a treatment course using the problem-based serious game. The game was designed based on the principles of problem-based learning and serious games, i.e., higher order thinking, collaborative learning, and cognitive thinking and information visualization theory. A non-random sampling procedure (purposive sampling) was used in this quasi-experimental study and the participants formed to 2 groups, the experimental group (n = 24) and the control group (n = 26). MANOVA test results indicated that the experimental group participants who had experienced the Immersivio game were more motivated to learn computer graphics in terms of extrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation, interest, attainment, cost, identification with academics, self-efficacy, and instrumentality. This study has implications for basic and advanced computer graphic lecturers and educators in this field.

CURRENT OPINION IN CHEMICAL BIOLOGY			English	Review							COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN; ZINC-BINDING; RECEPTOR; CONVERSION; BIOSENSOR; ALLOSTERY; PROTEINS; SEQUENCE; MUTANTS; DOMAIN	Proteins that behave as switches help to establish the complex molecular logic that is central to biological systems. Aspiring to be nature's equal, researchers have successfully created protein switches of their own design; in particular, numerous and varied zinc-triggered switches have been made. Recent studies in which such switches have been readily identified from combinatorial protein libraries support the notion that proteins are primed to show allosteric behavior and that newly created ligand-binding sites will often be functionally coupled to the original activity of the protein. If true, this notion suggests that switch engineering might be more tractable than previously thought, boding well for the basic science, sensing and biomedical applications for which protein switches hold much promise.

Implementation of the approach was tested in industry and conclusions reached on the effectiveness of the strategies included in terms of developing an offering with improved sustainability performance as well as practical use as an industry approach. Two strategies incorporated are functional and systems thinking, as these are seen as key for increasing the environmental benefits of offerings. This paper summarises the SPSD approach, general industry testing results, describes how and why functional and systems strategies are incorporated in it and industry testing results relating to their use. This provides valuable information on how functional and systems related considerations can be practically and effectively included in sustainable offering development. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Investigating the Role of the Eurasian Badger (<i>Meles meles</i>) in the Nationwide Distribution of the Western European Hedgehog (<i>Erinaceus europaeus</i>) in England	ANIMALS			English	Article						citizen science; conservation; displacement; predator-prey interaction; spatial use	INTRAGUILD PREDATION; CITIZEN-SCIENCE; ABUNDANCE; DIET; TOOL; COMMUNITIES; MUSTELIDAE; CARNIVORA; DENSITY; DECLINE	Simple Summary The hedgehog is a species known to many in society. What is perhaps less known, is that the hedgehog has been declining across large parts of Europe, including the United Kingdom. Effective hedgehog conservation requires a sound understanding of the causes of the decline. A potential cause is the badger, whose population has been recovering in recent years. The badger is an intraguild predator of the hedgehog, meaning that not only do the two species share the same food, like snails and earthworms, but badgers also predate on hedgehogs. Our study investigates how the presence of hedgehogs is related to the presence of badgers, along with other landscape features. Using information from two nationwide citizen science surveys, we first determine where both species can be found and then identify which factors best explain hedgehog presence. We found that the badger was indeed important, and hedgehogs were less likely to be found in areas where badgers were likely to be found. Interestingly, hedgehogs were also likely to be found in arable land, a habitat not directly thought to be favourable for hedgehogs. Badgers may, therefore, be an important consideration when designing hedgehog conservation plans, and further research of these impacts is needed. Abstract Biodiversity is declining globally, which calls for effective conservation measures. It is, therefore, important to investigate the drivers behind species presence at large spatial scales. The Western European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is one of the species facing declines in parts of its range. Yet, drivers of Western European hedgehog distribution at large spatial scales remain largely unknown. At local scales, the Eurasian badger (Meles meles), an intraguild predator of the Western European hedgehog, can affect both the abundance and the distribution of the latter. However, the Western European hedgehog and the Eurasian badger have shown to be able to co-exist at a landscape scale. We investigated whether the Eurasian badger may play a role in the likelihood of the presence of the Western European hedgehog throughout England by using two nationwide citizen science surveys. Although habitat-related factors explained more variation in the likelihood of Western European hedgehog presence, our results suggest that Eurasian badger presence negatively impacts the likelihood of Western European hedgehog presence. Intraguild predation may, therefore, be influencing the nationwide distribution of hedgehogs in England, and further research is needed about how changes in badger densities and intensifying agricultural practices that remove shelters like hedgerows may influence hedgehog presence.

It has a wider space of membership degrees. Thus, it is more capable in expressing and handling the fuzzy information in engineering practice and scientific research. However, PFSs lack a mathematical tool to express stochastic or probability information, rendering it unsuitable for application in many scenarios. In this article, an ordered number pair is used to describe fuzzy information and stochastic information under uncertain environments, namely constrained Pythagorean fuzzy set (CPFS). The CPFS has two components, CPFS = (A, P), where A is the classical PFS, while P is a measurement of reliability for A. For PFS, CPFS is the first unified description of fuzzy information and probabilistic information, which is a more flexible way to describe knowledge or thinking. Furthermore, the similarity measure of CPFSs is presented, which meets the similarity measure theorems and can better indicate the flexibility of CPFSs. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate that the CPFSs similarity measure is reasonable and effective. The method of similarity measure can be degenerated to the similarity measure of PFSs under specific case and can avoid generating counter-intuitive results. In addition, similarity measure of CPFSs is applied to medical diagnosis and target classification of Iris. These experimental results have proven the practicability and effectiveness of our model.

Eighty-six students completed presurvey and postsurvey instruments to assess their knowledge and perceived confidence to recommend a self-care product to a patient prior to and following participation in the Amazing Self-Care Race. Students demonstrated a significant increase in their ability and confidence to recommend self-care products following the activity (p<0.001). Conclusion. The Amazing Self-Care Race is an effective educational activity that increases student knowledge and confidence in self-care therapeutics. The activity helped students to develop self-care skills, enabled them to learn through doing, encouraged them to synthesize information while making self-care recommendations, and helped them to develop confidence by thinking on their feet.

J	Yu, JC; Suprayitno; Yang, LW				Yu, Jyh-Cheng; Suprayitno; Yang, Li-Wei			Optical design optimization of high contrast light guide plate for front light unit	MICROSYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES-MICRO-AND NANOSYSTEMS-INFORMATION STORAGE AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Multi-Conference on Engineering and Technology Innovation (IMETI)	OCT 27-31, 2017	Hualien, TAIWAN					This study addresses the optical design of LED edge-lit light guide plate (LGP) for front light unit panel of high illuminating contrast. Front light displays have excellent readability in outdoor environment with bright ambient light. A LED light guide is still required as an auxiliary lighting, referred to as a front light unit (FLU), in a dim environment. The ray tracing of the FLU light guide plate can be roughly classified into the noise rays refracted out of LGP directly and the image rays refracted downward to illuminate the reading media. Only the image rays is effective for FLU, and the noise ray will result in glare problems. This study defines the Effective Contrast Ratio (ECR) as the percentage of the image rays over the total rays within the +/- 30 degrees viewing angle. The layout of cylindrical microstructures are analyzed to determine a preferred configuration design from either concave or convex features deployed on the emitting surface or the bottom surface of LGP. Thought the ray tracing simulations of both the convex bottom and the concave bottom feature designs show excellent ECR over 90%, the concave design is preferred for better durability and assembly concerns at a cost of lower illuminating efficiency. The optimum parameters of the truncated cone microfeature with maximum ECR are identified as the base diameter of 70 (m), the aspect ratio of 0.46, and the feature sidewall angle of 78 degrees using a sequential optimization of Kriging Surrogate. A preliminary prototype of the LGP has been fabricated using Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) molding process from a SU8 master. A qualitative comparison of the photographic pictures of a sample text demonstrates the excellent transparency and uniform illumination of the LGP with the proposed feature design.

J	van der Horst, D				van der Horst, Dan			Spatial cost-benefit thinking in multi-functional forestry; towards a framework for spatial targeting of policy interventions	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						spatial targeting; CBA; multi-functional land use; value maps; GIS	GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; CONTINGENT VALUATION; CHILTERN-HILLS; SITKA SPRUCE; GIS; VALUES; INDICATORS; SCALE; SUSTAINABILITY	Many countries now actively encourage land use change for the provision of multiple benefits, specifically including non-market benefits. often such policies have been poorly designed because of a lack of understanding of the spatial distribution of the potential costs and-especially-non-market benefits from land use change. As with market goods, the potential yield of non-market goods and services from land use can be highly spatially variable. in recent years, more and more studies on the economic aspects of natural resources have started to make use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS). What is yet lacking is the systematic adoption of a framework for the spatial targeting of policy interventions which can be used to improve decision making in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, equity or public acceptability. This paper uses existing studies in forestry to present such a framework and discusses its potential uses and limitations as a new standard tool to inform multi-functional land use decisions.

Yet to date, it is not clear what specific abilities are needed to adequately accomplish this task, thereby hindering both its assessment and the development and evaluation of related interventions. By systematically building on past research, this study aimed to operationally define the concept ofhealth information appraisal competence. Methods We systematically searched five scholarly databases to identify the conceptualizations and operational definitions of information appraisal in different disciplines. The resulting operationalization was subsequently validated through an online consultation exercise among 85 Swiss stakeholders. Results Ninety-four publications were included in the review to the point of saturation. We extracted 646 skills, attitudes, and knowledge for health information appraisal. We then collated overlapping or duplicate statements, which produced a list of 43 unique statements belonging to six emergent themes or core competences: (1) basic competence, (2) predisposition, (3) identification competence, (4) critical evaluation competence, (5) selection competence, and (6) application competence. The consultation exercise enriched the operationalization of some of the core competences and confirmed the importance of all competences. Most skills, attitudes, and knowledge, however, were assigned low feasibility by the stakeholders. Conclusions This study was the first attempt to systematically operationalizehealth information appraisal competence. From a theoretical perspective, it sheds light on an understudied, health literacy domain, thus contributing to clarity around the concept. From a practical perspective, it provides a strong theoretical basis for the development of a tool to measurehealth information appraisal competence. This could be used routinely as a screening tool, as an outcome measure for public health interventions, or to identify citizens who are most at risk. Furthermore, it will provide support for the development of future interventions to buildhealth information appraisal competencein the population.

Life Cycle Thinking for the environmental and financial assessment of rice management systems in the Senegal River Valley	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Agricultural emissions; Crop management; Irrigated rice; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle costing; Sustainability	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY; CROPPING SYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INTENSIFICATION SRI; METHANE EMISSIONS; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; NITROUS-OXIDE; LOWLAND RICE; TRADE-OFFS	Rice is a staple food in Senegal, which however imports more than 70% of the rice consumed annually to meet its domestic demand. Despite governmental efforts to increase rice self-sufficiency, both rice supply and yields remain low. Senegalese farmers face challenges related to irrigation infrastructure and fertiliser access, besides those derived from climate change. This study applies Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) combined with financial Life Cycle Costing (LCC) to evaluate alternative scenarios for rice management in the Senegal River Valley and identify sustainability hotspots and potential improvements. Specifically, rice cultivation in Ross Be & PRIME;thio (Saint Louis, Senegal) is assessed based on the observed agricultural practices during the dry seasons of 2016 and 2017. Two scenarios capturing conventional (CONV) and intensive (INT) practices are compared to two reference scenarios (SAED scenarios) according to the recommendations of the official agricultural advisory service. The INT scenario generates the lowest impacts per kg of paddy rice in seven out of thirteen impact categories, including climate change, freshwater and marine eutrophication, ozone depletion and water scarcity. This is due to the higher yields (7.4 t ha(-1)) relative to CONV (4.8 t ha(-1)) and the two reference SAED scenarios (6.0 t ha(-1)). The two latter scenarios show the lowest values in the remaining categories, although they also generate slightly lower profits than INT (138 euro t(-1) vs. 149 euro t(-1)) due to increased labour costs for additional fertilisation treatments. The results from both LCA and LCC underline the importance of increasing yields to decrease environ -mental impacts and production costs of rice when estimated per kg of product. Well-designed fertiliser application doses and timing and increased mechanisation can deliver further environmental benefits. Additional improvements (e.g. in irrigation, crop rotations, straw management) could be considered to promote the long -term sustainability and profitability of rice production in Senegal. LCA in combination with financial LCC is identified as a decision-support tool for evaluating the sustainability of alternative crop management practices. Life Cycle Thinking can still benefit from experiential learning based on information exchange between farmers, researchers and extension agents to contribute to a sustainable agriculture and ultimately to food security in Africa.

A sample of their patients filled out the same scale and made evaluations of their physicians before and after a target visit. POPULATION Physicians and patients in a large multispecialty group practice and a model health maintenance organization were included. Forty-five physicians in internal medicine, family practice, and cardiology participated, as well as 909 of their patients who had a significant concern. OUTCOMES MEASURED We measured trust in the physician pre-visit, and visit satisfaction and physician endorsement immediately post-visit. RESULTS Among patients, patient-centered beliefs (a preference for information and control) were associated with being female, white, younger, more educated, and having a higher income; among physicians these beliefs were unrelated to sex, ethnicity, or experience. The patients of patient-centered physicians were no more trusting or endorsing of their physicians, and they were not more satisfied with the target visit. However, patients whose beliefs were congruent with their physicians' beliefs were more likely to trust and endorse them, even though they were not more satisfied with the target visit. CONCLUSIONS The extent of congruence between physicians' and patients' beliefs plays an important role in determining how patients evaluate their physicians, although satisfaction with a specific visit and overall trust may be determined differently.

J	Bardoe, D; Hayford, D; Bio, RB; Gyabeng, J				Bardoe, Dennis; Hayford, Daniel; Bio, Robert Bagngmen; Gyabeng, Jones			Challenges to the implementation of STEM education in the Bono East Region of Ghana	HELIYON			English	Article						Science Technology Engineering And mathematics (STEM; Common core state standards for mathematics (CCSS); International society for technology in education standards for technology (ISTE); education standards for technology (ISTE); Next generation science standards (NGSS); Career and technical education (CTE); Professional development opportunity (PDO); Information communication technology (ICT); Senior high school (SHS); Teaching and learning materials (TLM'S)		STEM education interrelates science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, ensuring that all interrelated contents are taught in coherence instead of in isolation. This promotes collaboration, critical thinking, and active engagement among students. The study ascertained the factors that compromise the implementation of STEM practices in the Bono East Region of Ghana to gain a moderately broad and deep understanding, allowing for a critical analysis of outcomes. It adopted a descriptive survey design to explore information concerning STEM education as it existed from May to October 2022. The study was carried out in Public Senior High and Vocational-Technical Schools in the Bono East Region of Ghana. The schools were split into STEM-related schools and non-STEM-related schools using a stratified sampling technique. Ten STEM-related schools were chosen using a purposive sampling method. 271 instructors from the departments of Science, Mathematics, and Information Communication Technology made up the study's population. A survey using a well-structured closed-ended questionnaire was administered online and the response obtained was transformed into frequencies and percentages in tabular forms using Microsoft Excel version 2016 (Microsoft, USA). Software Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25 (IBM, USA) was used to perform a chi-square test to determine differences between responses obtained at the test significance of 5%. The study revealed that the general implementation of STEM practices throughout the studied Senior High Schools was below the mark. Inadequate STEM teaching-learning materials, limited certified STEM teachers, lack of STEMdedicated infrastructure, inadequate professional development opportunities, absence of STEM documented standards and curriculum, limited access to technology, and limited time for teaching STEM-related subjects were some of the major factors contributing to the unsuccessful implementation of STEM practices in studied Public Senior High and Vocational-Technical Schools. Be that as it may, the study, therefore, recommended some measures including comprehensive STEM policies, adoptions of systematic STEM framework, and rigorous curriculum overhaul to be considered by the various stakeholders of education to realize the aspirations of inclusive STEM education.

J	Zhang, ZW; Yoo, Y; Lyytinen, K; Lindberg, A				Zhang, Zhewei; Yoo, Youngjin; Lyytinen, Kalle; Lindberg, Aron			The Unknowability of Autonomous Tools and the Liminal Experience of Their Use	INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						autonomous tools; socio-material agency; liminality; design; digital innovation	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; PATH DEPENDENCE; TECHNOLOGY; DESIGN; SOCIOLOGY; COMMUNICATION; ORGANIZATION; INNOVATION; NETWORKS; ROUTINES	In the extant theoretical discourse on sociotechnical systems, the relationships between inputs and outputs of technologies are assumed to be knowable to human agents, occasionally ex ante and always ex post. Recently, a new breed of autonomous tools has emerged, which can independently learn and execute novel actions. The input-output relationships of these tools, however, are unknowable to human agents both ex ante and ex post. This calls for analysis of how humans experience the enactment of socio-material agency while interacting with autonomous tools. To this end, we conduct an exploratory, theory building, comparative case study at one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturers. We investigate how chip designers interact with two families of design technologies: one following a traditional designer-centric approach in which the designer knows what outputs particular inputs to the tools will generate and another relying on autonomous tools that continually surprise the user. Our inquiry reveals significant differences in designers' experiences of using different tools. When using autonomous tools, designers' experience of enacting socio-material agency becomes liminal, a state of continuous emergence, in which interactions with the tools are marked by ambiguity, and the design is moved forward along multiple design trajectories in accordance with a multifarious temporality. These insights require us to expand upon several dominant views on the enactment of socio-material agency and necessitate novel thinking on the role and impact of autonomous tools in future work systems as well as on how design and innovation proceeds under such conditions.

The first year focused on getting students acquire a similar level of knowledge in sustainability, while, on a higher level, the experiential learning phase (project work) was supported with specific reflection assignments. In the second year, more specific attention was directed toward allowing students to get acquainted with systems thinking and deal with inter- and transdisciplinary issues by approaching problems from a multi-stakeholder view. Insight in the impact and the appreciation of the setup of the course was obtained from a series of questionnaires offered to all participating students at the beginning, about midway, and again at the end of the course. Findings Analysis of the students' self-reported sustainability competence development shows a clear positive impact for almost all students who participated. A clear relation between the observed change and the students' self-rating and attitude at the start, as well as with their discipline, is observed. Originality/value Information is gained on a number of factors of importance to impact the students' attitude toward action for sustainability, and how this can be further improved.

We showed members of a national U.S. life-span panel a hypothetical scenario about a failing plan that was halfway complete. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention to focus on how to improve the situation, an intervention to focus on thoughts and feelings, or a no-intervention control group. First, we found that the thoughts and feelings intervention reduced sunk-cost bias in decisions about project completion, as compared to the improvement intervention and the no-intervention control. Second, older age was associated with greater willingness to cancel the failing plan across all 3 groups. Third, we found that introspection processes helped to explain the effectiveness of the interventions. Specifically, the larger reduction in sunk-cost bias as observed in the thoughts and feelings intervention (vs. the improvement intervention) was associated with suppression of future-oriented thoughts of eventual success, and with suppression of augmentations of the scenario that could make it seem reasonable to continue the plan. Fourth, we found that introspection processes were related to age differences in decisions. Older people were less likely to mention future-oriented thoughts of eventual success associated with greater willingness to continue the failing plan. We discuss factors to consider when designing interventions for reducing sunk-cost bias.

Hence, apart from compliance of legislation that prescribes customs procedures, customs authorities face important decisions regarding design and implementation. In that context, this empirical research explores the extent to what digitalization of the Customs Administration of Serbia can improve the customs transit performances, in terms of enforcement of trading policy, without applying certain managerial tools, such as process thinking in lean innovation. The final data analysis of the research indicates that managing the organization through the functional units, rather than the processes, and without applying lean principles to the digital transformation initiative would not completely standardize the customs transit procedure.

These organelles are thought to have originated from photosynthetic cyanobacteria through endosymbiosis. During endosymbiosis, most cyanobacterial genes were transferred to the host nucleus. Therefore, most chloroplast proteins became encoded in the nuclear genome and must return to the chloroplast after translation. The N-terminal cleavable transit peptide (TP) is necessary and sufficient for the import of nucleus-encoded interior chloroplast proteins. Over the past decade, extensive research on the TP has revealed many important characteristic features of TPs. These studies have also shed light on the question of how the many diverse TPs could have evolved to target specific proteins to the chloroplast. In this review, we summarize the characteristic features of TPs. We also highlight recent advances in our understanding of TP evolution and provide future perspectives about this important research area.

The VS composite cylinder is designed first based on theoretical buckling analysis. Then, the "homogenized" stiffness method is proposed to account for the effect of the gaps on material properties in a computationally efficient way. Finally, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to obtain optimum solutions containing manufacturing interaction. The optimization results show that the buckling capacity of the VS cylinder with the consideration of manufacturing defects is 14.6% higher than its constant stiffness (CS) counterpart and reduced by 4.8% compared to the VS composite cylinder without gaps. In it, the gaps where the circumferential angle changes from 90 degrees to 270 degrees are thought to be the reason for the reduction of the critical buckling load of the VS cylinder considering gaps. Moreover, narrower tow width, wider course width, as well as smaller steering radius together with aspect ratio would result in higher critical buckling load. These results offer more realistic VS composite designs to improve the bending-induced buckling performance of the cylinder effectively.

The participating disciplines have reached a state in which traditional methods and forms of input data introduce entropy that compromises sustainable construction in larger projects. It became difficult to reach planned optimum project duration and costs this way. New approaches based on the systematic digitalization of the building lifecycle, from design to demolition, can solve the problem by involving the concepts of building information modeling (BIM) systems and big data. Previous research on BIM and big data only studied the potential for construction performance. In addition to extending research into systems' thinking and technical sustainability of big visual data, this paper extends our previous work in the area by introducing a new conceptual and technical framework for sustainable management of construction site big visual data.

J	Kyi, C; Tse, N; Khazam, S				Kyi, Caroline; Tse, Nicole; Khazam, Sandra			The potential role of citizen conservation in re-shaping approaches to murals in an urban context	STUDIES IN CONSERVATION			English	Article						Citizen science; Urban murals; Conservation; Participation; Shared authorities; Digital platforms	SCIENCE; CHALLENGES; TOOL	Public visual spaces, populated by a blend of community murals, unauthorised street art, and historic painted mercantile signs, are often the mark of an urban environment that is both progressive and eclectic. Changes in the aesthetic and cultural value of these urban mural forms have led to an increase in the appreciation and, in some instances, promotion of their artistic merit and cultural significance as examples of public art. However, examining the significance of these works, with a view to implementing a conservation approach is problematic. This is due to a number of practical and theoretical considerations that are primarily a result of the ephemeral existence of urban murals outside conventional exhibition spaces, and issues associated with their often fragmented ownership and uncertain authorship. Consequently, larger thinking on the interpretation, conservation assessment, and advocacy for the conservation of urban murals are required. Key to defining and implementing such strategies is contextualising the public visual spaces that these murals occupy and, as part of this, the local and wider communities' perception of these murals as culturally significant objects as well as fostering awareness and understanding of appropriate measures aimed at their conservation. This paper examines the role of citizen science, or crowd-sourcing, of local community members in establishing a conservation dialogue and generating conservation-relevant data on urban murals. It looks specifically at a project involving a collection of in situ historic painted mercantile signs also known as ghost signs in the City of Port Phillip, Melbourne, Australia. The project fostered the establishment of an informed and open dialogue between conservation specialists and participants from the local community on the significance of local ghost signs whilst transferring knowledge on conservation processes and assessment methods. Working directly with community members, a programme was designed in which conservation and community knowledge of these urban art forms, could be collected and exchanged across digital platforms. This enabled researchers to examine how citizen science can be utilised as a research tool as well as a means to advocate for the conservation of collections of urban murals. It created the opportunity to consider the role of non-specialists and shared authorities in the collection and collation of conservation-relevant data and how information generated from what we call citizen conservation projects, can inform the way in which conservators evaluate and prioritize the conservation of urban cultural heritage. The data gathered and interpreted proved to be the most effective means of 'conserving' these often ephemeral forms of cultural material.

Digital Learning Resources for Prosthodontic Education: The Perspectives of a Long-Term Dental Educator Regarding 4 Key Factors	JOURNAL OF PROSTHODONTICS-IMPLANT ESTHETIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE DENTISTRY			English	Article						3D learning resources; augmented reality; clinical correlations; critical thinking; digital learning; interactivity; prosthodontic education; spatial ability; virtual reality	AUGMENTED REALITY; STUDENTS; ANATOMY	Technological advances have led to the introduction of 3D education programs specifically designed for dentistry, leading to the author's use of these programs in the education of dental students. Based on this usage, this paper proposes there are 4 key factors that can enhance student education (spatial ability, interactivity, critical thinking, and clinical correlations with integration of multiple dental disciplines). These key factors can be incorporated into student learning through the use of 3D education programs in class. Lessons learned from using these programs include the importance of regular use in class as well as testing students both visually and textually on the content present in such programs. In this way, students will use the program and thereby enhance their 3D visualization skills while learning the required didactic information. Simply providing students with access to such programs without regular use in class and without testing the students on the content leads to these programs' lack of use. As a result, the students miss an opportunity to enhance their ability to visualize structures three dimensionally and manipulate them in their minds, a process known as spatial ability that is linked to success in the sciences.

Design: Parallel group randomized controlled trial with 1- and 12-week follow-ups. Setting: Community health center. Participants: Adults (N=102) with chronic noncancer pain referred for self-management support. Eighty of 102 participants completed 12-week follow-up assessments. No participants withdrew with adverse events. Interventions: Participants were randomized to COMMENCE or usual care. Main Outcome Measures: Primary: Function measured using the Short Musculoskeletal Function AssessmenteDysfunction Index. Secondary: Short Musculoskeletal Function AssessmenteBother Index, Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System pain interference, work status, numeric pain, and fatigue rating scales, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Pain Self-Efficacy Scale, Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire, number of health care visits, satisfaction, and global rating of change. Results: COMMENCE resulted in greater improvements in function (mean difference [MD] at 12-wk follow-up=-8.0; 95% CI, -14.7 to -1.3), bother with functional difficulties (MD, -12.0; 95% CI, -20.8 to -3.2), pain intensity (MD, -1.0; 95% CI, -2.1 to -0.1), catastrophizing (MD, -8.2; 95% CI, -14.5 to -2.0), self-efficacy (MD, 7.0; 95% CI, 0.8-13.2), knowledge (MD, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.6-3.9), satisfaction (MD, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7-1.8), and perceived change (MD, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.8-2.1). There were no significant between-group differences in pain interference, work, fatigue, depressive symptoms, or health care visits. Conclusion: COMMENCE is more effective than usual care at improving function, pain, catastrophic thinking, self-efficacy, pain knowledge, satisfaction, and perceived change but not pain interference, work status, fatigue, depressive symptoms, or health care visits.

Nevertheless, few studies empirically analyse how it acts as a binding force of both business practices. This study examines 1501 sus-tainability reports using a mixed human-artificial intelligence method based on Python's text mining libraries. This method takes advantage of AI's capabilities to extract information from large samples of data and of human critical thinking to find patterns in those data. Specifically, the method is used to evaluate the adoption of In-dustry 4.0 technologies, analyse how they are deployed worldwide, and investigate their sustainability outcomes. In terms of overall frequency, robots and cybersecurity are the most often reported technologies. Broken down by the firm's region, Asian firms have the highest rate of adoption, while African firms are lagging. Regarding the themes, Industry 4.0 is mainly adopted to improve production processes and customer experience. A small percentage of firms, particularly in Europe and North America, utilize Industry 4.0 to reduce the environmental footprint of their operations. Furthermore, results indicate that Industry 4.0 and sustainability are following two routes. Some firms have massively adopted Industry 4.0 to increase operational efficiency and reaped envi-ronmental gains as an indirect consequence of improved operations. Others have chosen to balance the adoption of technologies aimed to increase productivity with innovations whose explicit aim is the reduction of their operations' environmental footprint, such as additive manufacturing. Eastern firms tend to follow the first route while western firms the second. African and South American firms are still at a very early stage in their Industry 4.0 and sustainability journey. At the global level, Industry 4.0 is still far from being utilized as a catalyst to develop sustainability-driven business models.

The aim of this research was to develop a web-based application for self-management of type 1 diabetes, suitable for use by patients, their carers and physicians. Method: The study was comprised of two phases, the first being analysis of the kind of information and capabilities required by potential users of the system. Based on the results derived from the first phase of the study, the system prototype was designed and then evaluated using the think aloud' method and a standard questionnaire. The application was designed for use by patients, their carers and physicians. Patients could enter the level of blood glucose, insulin and activities on a daily basis, and physicians were able to supervise a patient's health status from a distance. Results: Users were generally satisfied with the final version of the system. People with a wide range of literacy skills were able to use the system effectively. Conclusion: Patients or their carers could use the web-based application as a log book by entering the level of blood glucose and insulin doses on a regular basis, and as an educational resource to improve self-management skills. Physicians could use the system at any time convenient to them to support patients by giving medical advice. Further research is needed to report the effectiveness of the system in practice.

Methods: A postal survey among a representative sample of Norwegian physicians across all specialities (N = 1605), using a translated questionnaire previously used to study attitudes towards disclosing prognostic information among US internists. Results: A response rate of 70% was obtained after one reminder. 85% of the responders agreed to the helpfulness of an optimistic attitude. A factor analysis revealed three meaningful factors: 'Prognostic communication is stressful', 'Fearing loss of reputation' and 'Reinforcement of positive prospects'. In multivariable models significantly more female than male physicians found aspects of prognostication straining (beta = 0.143, p < 0.001). Those more experienced in communication of prognostic information towards end of life were less likely to support using reinforcement of positive prospects (beta = 0.067, p = 0.001). Conclusion: After years of focusing on patient autonomy and open communication between patient and physician many Norwegian physicians display attitudes that might hide the true content of prognostic information from the patients. Practice implications: Many physicians think they are inadequately trained in prognostication and communication of prognostic information. suggesting that increased education and training are needed if patients' wishes for information on prognosis are to be met in an individualised manner.

In particular, webpage perception of people with different cognitive styles is compared. Based on Nisbett's cognitive model of holistic and analytic thought, this study hypothesizes that differences between holistic thought and analytic thought can be reflected in webpage perception. Working with this hypothesis, an experiment was carried out involving Chinese, Korean, and American participants. The users' eye movements, which can provide specific information about their cognitive processes, were recorded while browsing different language versions of a webpage prototype. In the end, the hypothesis of this study was supported. Findings from the analysis suggest that the Chinese, Korean, and American participants employed different viewing patterns when viewing the webpage, revealing a positive relationship with Nisbett's cognitive theory. Given that cognitive differences exist among holistically-minded people and analytically-minded people, it is suggested that webpage design should be carried out according to the target audience's specific cognitive style in order to enhance perception and usage of a webpage.

Learning progressions in context: Tensions and insights from a semester-long middle school modeling curriculum	SCIENCE EDUCATION			English	Article						design-based research; learning progression; longitudinal analysis; modeling	EPISTEMOLOGICAL RESOURCES; SCIENCE INSTRUCTION; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK; INQUIRY; EDUCATION; GOALS	Schwarz and colleagues have proposed and refined a learning progression for modeling that provides a valuable template for envisioning increasingly sophisticated levels of modeling practice at an aggregate level (Fortus, Shwartz, & Rosenfeld, 2016; Schwarz et al., 2009; Schwarz, Reiser, Archer, Kenyon, & Fortus, 2012). Thinking about learning progressions for modeling, however, involves challenges in coordinating between aggregate arcs in the curriculum and individual student learning trajectories. First, individual student performance is often dependent on students' epistemic aims and the nature of the conceptual and representational context. Second, approaches for longitudinally supporting students in modeling is a relatively nascent endeavor, although notable exemplars have been developed (e.g., IQWST). Third, research on the highest levels of the proposed progression is often hypothetical, because few students demonstrate high-level modeling practices in typical classrooms. In response to these challenges, we conducted a semester-long design-based study of eighth graders engaging in diagrammatic, physical, and computational modeling. In this paper, we explore conceptual and representational contexts designed to support sophisticated modeling practices and beliefs, analyze the nature of high-level performances achieved through these contexts, and suggest revisions to the articulation of the Schwarz and colleagues learning progression to increase its utility and generalizability when viewed through a resource-related lens.

These systems need data to provide various economic and social benefits to users as well as businesses. However, the extensive use of personal data in systems poses a threat to user privacy. Therefore, privacy laws expect software systems to practice Data Minimization (DM), to minimize data in software systems. This has put software developers in a dilemma to minimize user data to provide user privacy and maximize user data for enhanced system functionality. Following the design science research approach, in this research we propose and evaluate a methodology that enables developers to make their decisions to minimize user data in software systems through understanding data. The methodology encourage developers to think of the ways they would use data in a system design focusing on the storage and sharing of data. Developers in the three experiments conducted to evaluate the methodology agreed that it enables them to think of the ways they use data in system designs and it helps them to make decisions to minimize using data in a system design. Developers also showed positive intention to use the proposed methodology within system development activities. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kim, MS				Kim, Mi Song			Empowering Prospective Teachers to Become Active Sense-Makers: Multimodal Modeling of the Seasons	JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						A technology-rich learning environment; Embodied engagement; Multimodal modeling activities; Empowering teachers; Sense-makers; Informal learning; Seasons	DESIGN-BASED RESEARCH; SCIENCE; ENVIRONMENTS	Situating science concepts in concrete and authentic contexts, using information and communications technologies, including multimodal modeling tools, is important for promoting the development of higher-order thinking skills in learners. However, teachers often struggle to integrate emergent multimodal models into a technology-rich informal learning environment. Our design-based research co-designs and develops engaging, immersive, and interactive informal learning activities called "Embodied Modeling-Mediated Activities" (EMMA) to support not only Singaporean learners' deep learning of astronomy but also the capacity of teachers. As part of the research on EMMA, this case study describes two prospective teachers' co-design processes involving multimodal models for teaching and learning the concept of the seasons in a technology-rich informal learning setting. Our study uncovers four prominent themes emerging from our data concerning the contextualized nature of learning and teaching involving multimodal models in informal learning contexts: (1) promoting communication and emerging questions, (2) offering affordances through limitations, (3) explaining one concept involving multiple concepts, and (4) integrating teaching and learning experiences. This study has an implication for the development of a pedagogical framework for teaching and learning in technology-enhanced learning environments-that is empowering teachers to become active sense-makers using multimodal models.

Although graph theory has rapid growth in modeling real-life issues, some vague details in real-life problems are hard to picture using the usual graph. Fuzzy graph theory is known for its applications in modeling the human thinking, which has the same structure as graph theory. The concept of fuzzy graphs extended to Pythagorean fuzzy sets depends on real-time situations. The purpose of interval-valued Pythagorean neutrosophic sets through which the values of the degree (membership, non-membership and neutral) can be taken from the intervals instead of the numbers so that it provides more adequate information about the uncertainty than traditional sets. This motivates us to introduce interval-valued Pythagorean neutrosophic sets in applications. The proposed investigation also leads to study the interval-valued Pythagorean neutrosophic graphs (IVPNGs) and their arithmetic operations. In addition, the concept of regular, strong, product, support strong, effective balanced IVPNGs are introduced for aggregating the IVPNGs information and analysed with suitable examples. Further, a methodology for successful curriculum design is examined to illuminate the adequacy and feasibility of the developed IVPNG.

We can assume, from related work in e-commerce, that general design factors known to affect trust in the site are important, but in this paper we also address the impact of factors specific to the health domain. Objective: The current study aimed to (1) assess the factorial structure of a general measure of Web trust, (2) model how the resultant factors predicted trust in, and readiness to act on, the advice found on health-related websites, and (3) test whether adding variables from social cognition models to capture elements of the response to threatening, online health-risk information enhanced the prediction of these outcomes. Methods: Participants were asked to recall a site they had used to search for health-related information and to think of that site when answering an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of a general Web trust questionnaire plus items assessing appraisals of the site, including threat appraisals, information checking, and corroboration. It was promoted on the hungersite.com website. The URL was distributed via Yahoo and local print media. We assessed the factorial structure of the measures using principal components analysis and modeled how well they predicted the outcome measures using structural equation modeling (SEM) with EQS software. Results: We report an analysis of the responses of participants who searched for health advice for themselves (N = 561). Analysis of the general Web trust questionnaire revealed 4 factors: information quality, personalization, impartiality, and credible design. In the final SEM model, information quality and impartiality were direct predictors of trust. However, variables specific to eHealth (perceived threat, coping, and corroboration) added substantially to the ability of the model to predict variance in trust and readiness to act on advice on the site. The final model achieved a satisfactory fit: chi(2)5 = 10.8 (P = .21), comparative fit index = .99, root mean square error of approximation = .052. The model accounted for 66% of the variance in trust and 49% of the variance in readiness to act on the advice. Conclusions: Adding variables specific to eHealth enhanced the ability of a model of trust to predict trust and readiness to act on advice.

It may provide a playful and novel learning environment for children to engage with all aspects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning. The purpose of this research is to examine how robotics learning activities may affect the cognitive abilities and cognitive processes of 6-8 years old children. The study adopted the mixed methods approach with a repeated measures design; three waves of data collection over 6 months, including quantitative data obtained from cognitive assessments and eye-tracking, and qualitative data from the interviews. A total of 31 children were recruited from an afterschool robotics program. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first RE research that used a combination of eye-tracking, cognitive assessments, and interviews for examining the effect of RE on children. Using linear growth models, the results of cognitive assessments showed that children's visuospatial working memory as well as logical and abstract reasoning skills improved over time. The interview data were analyzed by a thematic analysis. The results revealed that children perceived RE activities as game play, which made children more engaged in their study; parents found their children to be more focused on activities comparing to six months ago. Additionally, the visualization of the eye-tracking data suggested that children became more focused on RE activities and got faster to process the information across six months in general, which echoed the findings in assessments and interviews. Our findings may help educators and policymakers better understand the benefits of RE for young children.

Mental time travel: Effects of trial duration on episodic and semantic content	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Autobiographical memory; Prospection; Mental time travel; Episodic memory; Episodic future thinking	AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY; FUTURE EVENTS; SIMULATION; HIPPOCAMPUS	Studies exploring mental time travel commonly use cue-word paradigms to elicit past and future autobiographical events. However, the effect of trial duration (how long participants are allowed to describe events) on the relationship between episodic and nonepisodic detail and episodic specificity (i.e., whether longer durations increase event specificity) has not been examined. To resolve these issues, a cue-word study was devised whereby participants described past and future events under three randomly administered time constraints: short (1-min), standard (3-min), and long (5-min) durations. Findings indicated that an individual's capacity for episodic and nonepisodic thought for the past and future were unrelated. This lends supports to the idea that independent mechanisms are responsible for episodic and semantic information. This study also offers clarity concerning the effect of different trial durations on episodic specificity, which may aid the design of future studies of mental time travel.

J	HUTCHINSON, JM; ZENIOS, SA				HUTCHINSON, JM; ZENIOS, SA			FINANCIAL SIMULATIONS ON A MASSIVELY PARALLEL CONNECTION MACHINE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTER APPLICATIONS AND HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING			English	Article								The valuation of complex financial instruments that appear in the banking and insurance industries requires simulations of their cashflow behavior in a volatile interest rate environment. These simulations are complex and computationally intensive. Their use, thus far, has been limited to intra-day analysis and planning. Researchers at the Wharton School and Thinking Machines Corporation have developed model formulations for massively parallel architectures, like the Connection Machine CM-2. A library of financial modeling primitives has been designed and used to implement a model for the valuation of mortgage-backed securities. Analyzing a portfolio of these securities-which would require 2 days on a large mainframe-is carried out in 1 hour on a CM-2a. The valuation of a single security is carried out in real time (1-2 sec). It has been possible to design an interactive system that carries out sensitivity analysis, compares securities, or changes the assumptions of the model, and display the result under direct control from an analyst.

Interstellar Probe: Impact of the Voyager and IBEX results on science and strategy	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						Interstellar; Robotic spacecraft; Precursor mission; Heliosphere; Fields and particles	BOUNDARY EXPLORER MISSION; SOLAR-WIND; ELECTRIC PROPULSION; HELIOSPHERE; CASSINI; PLASMA; FLOW	The ongoing Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) and recent observations from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and Cassini missions are providing significant new information about the interaction of the heliosphere with the very local interstellar medium (VLISM). With new observations have come significant new puzzles for describing the interaction physics. Direct measurements of the shocked, solar-wind flow speed are now possible (from Voyager 2) and show the flow remains supersonic. This is one more piece of evidence supporting the idea that the bulk of the energy density in the plasma resides in a non-thermal component that extends to very high energies. There are both quantitative and qualitative implications for the overall heliospheric structure. Observations of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) by IBEX (in Earth orbit) from the interaction region(s) of the solar wind and the VLISM show unexpected structure on a variety of scales. In addition to the general "glow" of the sky in ENAs, IBEX data show a relatively narrow "ribbon" of atomic hydrogen emission from similar to 200 to similar to 6 keV, roughly circular, but asymmetric in intensity, and centered on an ecliptic longitude similar to 221 degrees and ecliptic latitude of 39 degrees. The ribbon may be ordered by the interstellar magnetic field. It passes through, rather than being centered on, the "nose" from which the local, neutral interstellar wind enters the Heliosphere, indicating that the flow is not the primary driver of the system as had been thought previously. The neutrals from both the glow and ribbon are also characterized by non-thermal distribution functions. ENAs are observed at higher energies as well by the Ion and Neutral Camera (INCA) on Cassini (in orbit about Saturn). A "belt" of emission, broader than the ribbon but similar to it, is seen up to similar to 50 keV. These observations emphasize the need for in situ measurements to understand the global nature of our local galactic environment, which is much more complex than previously thought. Only an interstellar probe with modern instruments and measurement requirements better defined by these recent observations can provide the new information required. Even more importantly, the broader scale of the interaction as revealed in these measurements suggests much greater flexibility in scientifically allowable, asymptotic trajectories from the heliosphere for the probe. This is a significant relaxation in the trajectory requirements that open up the trade space for Jupiter gravity assists to increase the flyout speeds. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Finch, CF; McIntosh, AS; McCrory, P				Finch, CF; McIntosh, AS; McCrory, P			What do under 15 year old schoolboy rugby union players think about protective headgear?	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Article						headgear; rugby union; schoolboy; prevention; protection; safety	PERFORMANCE PROJECT; FOOTBALL INJURIES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; IMPACT	Objectives-When protective headgear is designed, the attitudes of the intended users needs to be taken into account, as well as safety performance criteria. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the attitudes of schoolboy rugby union players towards protective headgear. Methods-A survey of 140 rugby union players (82.4% response rate) from 10 randomly selected school teams in metropolitan Sydney was conducted at the end of the 1999 playing season. Ah players were aged 14-16 years. Ah teams had participated in a trial of headgear during the 1999 season in which six of the teams had been assigned to a headgear trial arm and four teams to a control arm. Players completed a self report questionnaire during a supervised session at school. The questionnaire collected information on recent head injuries, use of protective equipment, and attitudes towards headgear. Results-Some form of protective equipment was always worn by 76.1% of players: 93.6% reported using a mouthguard and 79.3% a helmet/headgear during the 1999 season. The two most important reasons for wearing headgear were related to safety concerns. Players with no recent head/neck injury were more likely to report that they felt safer when wearing headgear (p<0.001) and less likely to cite a previous injury as a motivating factor for wearing headgear (p<0.001) than those who had sustained a recent head/neck injury. Of the players who wore headgear during the 1999 season, 67% said that they played more confidently when they wore headgear, but 63% said that their head was hotter. Few players reported that their head was uncomfortable (15%) or that it was hard to communicate (3%) when they wore headgear. The main reasons for not wearing headgear were related to its design features: uncomfortable (61%) and it was hot (57%). Conclusions-The primary reason cited by players for wearing headgear is safety. Receiving an injury would also motivate non-wearers to wear headgear. Players report that they are more confident and able to tackle harder if they wear headgear, suggesting that a belief in its protective capabilities may influence behaviour. These attitudes need to be addressed in the design of effective headgear as well as in strategies to promote its use.

However, there is the danger that the excitement over these new devices will result in a misplaced focus on the technology, to the neglect of what must be the central focus - the people with complex communication needs who require augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). In order to truly harness the power of technology, rehabilitation and educational professionals must ensure that AAC intervention is driven, not by the devices, but rather by the communication needs of the individual. Furthermore, those involved in AAC research and development activities must ensure that the design of AAC technologies is driven by an understanding of motor, sensory, cognitive, and linguistic processing, in order to minimize learning demands and maximize communication power for individuals with complex communication needs across the life span.

Carole; Ewing, Gail; Kuhn, Isla; Farquhar, Morag			Support needs of patients with COPD: a systematic literature search and narrative review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE			English	Review						COPD; person-centered care; support needs	OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; SPECIALIST PALLIATIVE CARE; HEART-FAILURE; LUNG-CANCER; OF-LIFE; END; EXPERIENCES; BREATHLESSNESS; MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITY	Introduction: Understanding the breadth of patients' support needs is important for the delivery of person-centered care, particularly in progressive long-term conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Existing reviews identify important aspects of managing life with COPD with which patients may need support (support needs); however, none of these comprehensively outlines the full range of support needs that patients can experience. We therefore sought to systematically determine the full range of support needs for patients with COPD to inform development of an evidence-based tool to enable person-centered care. Methods: We conducted a systematic search and narrative review of the literature. Medline (Ovid), EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL were systematically searched for papers which included data addressing key aspects of support need, as identified by patients with COPD. Relevant data were extracted, and a narrative analysis was conducted. Results: Thirty-one papers were included in the review, and the following 13 domains (broad areas) of support need were identified: 1) understanding COPD, 2) managing symptoms and medication, 3) healthy lifestyle, 4) managing feelings and worries, 5) living positively with COPD, 6) thinking about the future, 7) anxiety and depression, 8) practical support, 9) finance work and housing, 10) families and close relationships, 11) social and recreational life, 12) independence, and 13) navigating services. These 13 domains of support need were mapped to three of the four overarching categories of need commonly used in relevant national strategy documents (ie, physical, psychological, and social); however, support needs related to the fourth category (spiritual) were notably absent. Conclusion: This review systematically identifies the comprehensive set of domains of support need for patients with COPD.

J	Xu, XZ				Xu, Xianzhong			ON THE ORAL HEALTH AND CHEWING ENJOYMENT OF THE ELDERLY: A REVIEW FROM THE POINT OF MECHANICS	JOURNAL OF TEXTURE STUDIES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Food for Elderly International Conference	OCT 16-17, 2016	Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	Zhejiang Gongshang Univ		Oral health; chewing ability; chewing enjoyment; fracture mechanics; material science	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; COMPLETE DENTURE; TOOTH LOSS; MASTICATORY PERFORMANCE; INCISOR PENETRATION; TEXTURAL PROPERTIES; TEMPORAL DOMINANCE; EATING CAPABILITY; OLDER-ADULTS; FOOD TEXTURE	With the advent of an aging society, the biggest challenge for the study of food science and technology is how to provide the best diet for older people with reduced chewing ability. General health is usually associated with oral health and healthy ageing is affected by what humans eat. Foods for the elderly should give them the maximum masticatory pleasure while satisfying their nutritional needs. It is well known that food oral processing is not only dominated by oral cavity structure and physiological state of human body, but also affected by the mechanical processes of food destruction in the mouth. Perception of food texture is thought to be the cognition of the human brain to the information of food deformation and fracture during oral processing. Increasing chewing difficulty due to the impaired dental functions is an major problem affecting the ability of food intake for many older people. From the viewpoint of mechanics, the manner of the deformation or breaking of an object is strongly dominated by its mechanical and geometrical properties of the materials and the conditions in which the object is loaded. It is therefore suggested that the food destruction process in the mouth might be investigated using the methods established in the engineering field. In this review, the main factors that affecting chewing behaviors of the elderly are analysed and discussed. The possibility of applying fracture mechanics theory and material structural optimization techniques to the design and production of food structures for older people is proposed. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Population aging means that the food industry is required to provide best diet for older consumers who may encounter chewing difficulty and dysphagia problems. People with deficient oral strategy need foods not only having easy-to-chew/swallow feature, but also can satisfy their chewing pleasure. Food structure design is a new direction of food science for the development of food products. The fundamental issue is to have a proper understanding how designed food is formed and fractured in the mouth. This work analyses the main factors that influence the chewing behaviors of the elderly and introduces fracture mechanics theory into the field of food oral processing. It will provide a new view-angle to understand both the food destruction process and the texture perception mechanism in the mouth.

These interfaces include a stencil-based structured interface (Struct); a semistructured interface (semiStruct), which is appropriate for applications that are mostly structured, for example, block structured grids, composite grids in structured adaptive mesh refinement applications, and over-set grids; and a finite element interface (FEI) for unstructured problems, as well as a conventional linear-algebraic interface (IJ). It is extremely important to provide an efficient, scalable implementation of these interfaces in order to support the scalable solvers of the library, especially when using tens of thousands of processors. This article describes the data structures, parallel implementation, and resulting performance of the IJ, Struct and semiStruct interfaces. It investigates their scalability, presents successes as well as pitfalls of some of the approaches and suggests ways of dealing with them.

Recent empirical studies show that some people have low scores on both of these dimensions (the so-called disengaged profile). Another model, Seeking Proxies for Internal States (SPIS), primarily proposed to explain obsessive-compulsive tendencies, provides a framework under which both rationality and experientiality can be understood as internal resources of a person. Low rationality and experientiality could thus be overcome by seeking external clues. In two subsequent studies on independent nonclinical samples (psychology students N = 268 and technical sciences students N = 549), we examined the relationship between constructs from CEST and SPIS models, and in addition, explored their patterns of interoceptive awareness (IA) in Study 2. A latent profile analysis showed that the disengaged profile was related to high SPIS and OC tendencies in both samples. In addition, rationality and experientiality had similar and more positive correlations with some IA dimensions, compared to SPIS (and OCI)-IA correlations. Thus, impaired connection to internal states together with OC tendencies might contribute to the understanding of the specific thinking style of those who do not primarily rely on either rationality or experientiality.

Through establishing Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship (CIE) educational skills and activities, this study used the BIG6 information search skills as a teaching strategy to cultivate students' entrepreneurial mindset and behavior, such as skills needed to start a new business that is beyond the currently available controllable resources. This study attempted to integrate creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship education with the Big Six (BIG 6) Information Stages teaching strategy, and explore its effectiveness on students' innovative motivation, creativity, metacognition, and self-perceived employability. The subjects were 64 junior students from the Department of Design at a university of science and technology in Taiwan. They were divided into the experimental and control group, each group with 32 students. The results indicate that the experimental group shows significant improvement in innovative motivation, creativity, and metacognition in the Special Projects courses. Based on the findings, specific suggestions are proposed for reference in education.

It is crucial to identify teachers' SRL activities that may lead to favorable TPACK. Previous studies have focused on the analysis of individual data sources from self-reported surveys or log files, which are insufficient to capture all SRL activities in the TPACK context. While multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) has the potential to improve SRL measurement, it remains unknown how multimodal data collected from different sources can be combined to identify salient features of SRL activities and examine how TPACK outcomes can be predicted by SRL activities identified from multimodal data. This study combined multimodal data from computer logs and think-aloud data to analyze teachers' SRL activities in designing a technology-integrated lesson. We identified the salient features of SRL from the combined data and explored how identified SRL activities might predict TPACK outcomes reflected in teacher-generated lesson plans. The results of random forest regression analysis show that three SRL activities from the logs and two from the think-aloud data formed the best combination that explained a significant proportion of variances in TPACK performance. The impact of MMLA in SRL measurement and the implication of this study are discussed.

Through discovering the key function parts and key function module in 3D CAD assembly model in advance, it can promote the designers' understanding and reuse efficiency of 3D assembly model in design reuse. Design/methodology/approach An approach for discovering key function module in complex mechanical 3D CAD assembly model is proposed. First, assembly network for 3D CAD assembly model is constructed, where the topology structure characteristics of 3D assembly model are analyzed based on complex network centrality. The degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and mutual information of node are used to evaluate the importance of the parts in 3D assembly model. Then, a multi-attribute decision model for part-node importance is established, and the comprehensive evaluation for key function parts in 3D assembly model is accomplished by combining Analytic Hierarchy Process and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Subsequently, a community discovery of function module in assembly model-based Clauset-Newman-Moore (CNM)-Centrality is given in details. Finally, 3D CAD assembly model of worm gear reducer is taken as an example to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of proposed method. Findings The key function part in CAD assembly model is evaluated comprehensively considering assembly topology more objectively. In addition, the key function module containing key function part is discovered from CAD assembly model by using CNM-Centrality-based community discovery. Practical implications The approach can be used for discovering important design knowledge from complex CAD assembly model when reusing the assembly model. It can help designers capture and understand the design thinking and intent, improve the reuse efficiency and quality. Originality/value The paper first proposes an approach for discovering key function module in complex mechanical 3D CAD assembly model taking advantage of complex network theory, where the key function part is evaluated using node centrality and TOPSIS, and the key function module is identified based on community discovery.

J	Pontoppidan, M; Blower, S; Solvang, JN; Bywater, T				Pontoppidan, Maiken; Blower, Sarah; Solvang, Julie Nygaard; Bywater, Tracey			What do parents think of using informational videos to support recruitment for parenting trials? A qualitative study	TRIALS			English	Article						Parents; Recruitment; Trial; Informed consent; Informational video; Qualitative	INFORMED-CONSENT; CLINICAL-TRIALS; DIGITAL MULTIMEDIA; CHILDREN; PARTICIPATION; EXPERIENCES; READABILITY; DECISIONS; LITERACY	Background Lower than expected recruitment and retention rates are common challenges in parenting trials-particularly for community-based trials targeting parents of young children that rely on face-to-face recruitment by frontline workers. Recruitment requires parental informed consent, yet information sheets have been criticized for being lengthy and complex, and particularly challenging for parents with low literacy. Recent innovations include 'talking head' information videos. This paper aims to explore parent perceptions of using a 'talking head' video to support informed consent, recruitment, and retention procedures in parenting trials. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with a sample of 24 mothers recruited after their final follow-ups in two different parenting trials in Denmark. Before consenting to participate in the trials, parents were invited to view a video of a member of the study team giving information about the study, and again before the interviews for the current study. The audio data was transcribed and thematic analysis was conducted. Results We identified three overarching themes: (1) general impression of the video, (2) thoughts on participation in research, and (3) recruitment and retention. Participants were generally positive in their appraisal of the two talking head informational videos. We found that participants felt that a mix of paper-based and video-based sources of information would enable them to make an informed choice about whether to participate in a research study. We also found that a professionally produced video featuring a key member of the study team produced a feeling of commitment to the study that could impact retention rates. Conclusions Informational videos are acceptable to parents; however, co-production or participant/patient involvement in the development of such videos is recommended. Informational videos may not increase recruitment but have the potential for improving retention. Key design recommendations are to ensure a 'professional' look to the video, to supplement videos with paper-based information, to keep the length to < 3 min, and for the 'talking head' part to feature a key member of the study team.

J	Utreras, E; Pontelli, E				Utreras, Emmanuel; Pontelli, Enrico			Introductory programming and young learners with visual disabilities: a review	UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY			English	Review						Visual disabilities; Computational thinking; Programming; Accessibility	SKILLS	Computational Thinking (CT) captures the mental processes used to model and solve problems using a computational processes. While often connected to programming, CT is a core problem-solving skill, which has been advocated by educational researchers as a core skill, at par with reading and comprehension. A variety of learning environments have been proposed to aid young learners in acquiring knowledge of CT. The majority of such environments are highly visual, linking the process of solving a problem computationally to the process of building a graphical representation of an algorithm, e.g., in the form of a graphical jigsaw puzzle. The algorithms are often used to produce a visual output, e.g., animations. The highly visual models have been shown to be inaccessible to young learners with visual disabilities. This paper provides a review of the literature, which addresses the challenges of learning CT by young learners with visual disabilities.

The molecular mechanism for translation defines the linear configuration of all nascent proteins. Nontrivial protein topology arises only upon post-translational processing events and often imparts functional benefits such as enhanced stability, making topology a unique dimension for protein engineering. Utilizing the assembly-reaction synergy, our group has developed several methods for the effective and convenient cellular synthesis of a variety of topological proteins, such as lasso proteins, protein rotaxanes, and protein catenanes. The work opens the access to new protein classes and paves the road toward illustrating the topological effects on structure-function relationship of proteins, which lays solid foundation for exploring topological proteins' practical application.What is the most favorite and original chemistry developed in your research group?Cellular synthesis of artificial topological proteins using genetically programmed post-translational cascade events.How do you get into this specific field?I was trained as a polymer chemist and always dream of accomplishing full control over macromolecules' length, sequence, stereochemistry, and topology. I got to learn about how nature uses polymer chemistry during my postdoc study at Caltech and was amazed by the delicate cellular machinery for making biopolymers. However, the rigorous template polymerization mechanism also defines the linear configuration of DNA, RNA, and protein. Inspired by my experience in supramolecular chemistry and genetically encoded click chemistry, I proposed the use of "assembly-reaction" synergy to make nonlinear proteins. By pre-programming information regarding assembly and reaction into the precursor protein's gene, the nascent linear protein knows what to do and undergoes a series of cascade events to transform into various chemical topologies. I enjoy this interdisciplinary approach in tackling a long-standing challenge.How do you supervise your students?Recognize that students are different. Start from a small project and finish it. Be rigorous on science, but flexible on routines. Give them sufficient freedom to explore, yet not too much to get lost. Open to debate and cultivate critical thinking. Always ready to help. Try to be a role model by acts, not words.What is the most important personality for scientific research?Curiosity, courage, persistence, and optimism.What are your hobbies?Reading and hiking.If you have anything else to tell our readers, please feel free to do so.There is no real boundary between scientific disciplines. They are often set by our training and mindsets. It often requires tremendous efforts to break such boundaries in order to advance science.

From an interdisciplinary and collaborative focus, pupils acquire knowledge and skills through investigative tasks, with a view to responding to a problem or challenge, in the form of a final product. The methodological implementation of PBL in specific teacher-training contexts is especially useful for curricular inclusion and the didactic treatment of relevant contemporary social problems and socially alive questions. In this investigation, the assessment of the perceived learning of a group of infant-education teacher trainees (n = 59), following a teacher-training program on social problems, is analyzed. The program is designed on the basis of the principal methodologies of PBL and the operational integration of information and communications technology (ICT) (WebQuests). The study begins with the pre-experimental quantitative designs of a cross-cutting prospective nature with a control group. The results provide information on the special didactic potential of active methodologies, including PBL, for the creative development of thought processes and the acquisition of social competencies and good citizenship in relation to social problems on interdisciplinary curricular projects for infant education. Likewise, it is evident that PBL methodology through ICT facilitates the acquisition of technological competencies, linked to the development of social and communicative competencies, as well as cooperative-collaborative work.

Life-Cycle Thinking and the LEED Rating System: Global Perspective on Building Energy Use and Environmental Impacts	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							LCA	This research investigates the relationship between energy use, geographic location, life cycle environmental impacts, and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The researchers studied worldwide variations in building energy use and associated life cycle impacts in relation to the LEED rating systems. A Building Information Modeling (BIM) of a reference 43 000 ft(2) office building was developed and situated in 400 locations worldwide while making relevant changes to the energy model to meet reference codes, such as ASHRAE 90.1. Then life cycle environmental and human health impacts from the buildings' energy consumption were calculated. The results revealed considerable variations between sites in the U.S. and international locations (ranging from 394 ton CO2 equiv to 911 ton CO2 equiv, respectively). The variations indicate that location specific results, when paired with life cycle assessment, can be an effective means to achieve a better understanding of possible adverse environmental impacts as a result of building energy consumption in the context of green building rating systems. Looking at these factors in combination and using a systems approach may allow rating systems like LEED to continue to drive market transformation toward sustainable development, while taking into consideration both energy sources and building efficiency.

Rare variants are thought to have larger effect sizes compared to common SNPs but effects of rare variants cannot be tested in the GWAS setting. Here we propose a novel method to test for association of rare variants obtained by sequencing in family-based samples by collapsing the standard family-based association test (FBAT) statistic over a region of interest. We also propose a suitable weighting scheme so that low frequency SNPs that may be enriched in functional variants can be upweighted compared to common variants. Using simulations we show that the family-based methods perform at par with the population-based methods under no population stratification. By construction, family-based tests are completely robust to population stratification; we show that our proposed methods remain valid even when population stratification is present.

Contextual information, morphometric, technological and use-wear analysis of the 68 published beads and those recently found, coupled with experimental reproduction of wear patterns, allow us to reconstruct the most probable way in which the N. kraussianus shells were strung. The results reveal unexpected regularities but also variability through the various levels that we interpret as resulting from changes in beadwork manufacture and design over time. The Blombos Cave beads may document one of the first examples of changes in social norms affecting the production and design of symbolic material culture. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Erete, S; Rankin, Y; Thomas, J				Erete, Sheena; Rankin, Yolanda; Thomas, Jakita			A Method to the Madness: Applying an Intersectional Analysis of Structural Oppression and Power in HCI and Design	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-HUMAN INTERACTION			English	Article						Power; structural oppression; Black feminism; critical HCI methods	VIOLENCE; BLACKS; MODEL	With increased focus on historically excluded populations, there have been recent calls for HCI research methods to more adequately acknowledge and address the historical context of racism, sexism, gendered racism, epistemic violence, classism, and so on. In this article, we utilize Black feminist epistemologies to serve as critical frameworks for understanding the historical context that reveals the interconnected systems of power that mutually influence one another to create unequal outcomes or social inequalities for different populations. Leveraging Black feminist thought (BFT) and intersectionality as critical social theories of design praxis, we introduce intersectional analysis of power-a method that enables HCI researchers, designers, and practitioners to identify and situate saturated sites of violence in a historical context and to transform the ways in which they engage with populations that have been historically oppressed. Engaging in self-reflection as researchers, we apply an intersectional analysis of power to co-design technologies with community street outreach workers who address violence in their predominantly Black communities. We: (1) identify the saturated site of violence; (2) identify the intersecting systems of power and who holds power (past and present); (3) describe the "conceptual glue" that binds these intersecting systems together and the assumption(s) that those who hold power are employing to guide their interactions; (4) examine the ways in which Black people are subjugated, surveilled, and/or expected to assimilate to "normative" ways of being and behaving; and (5) identify acts of resistance. This article contributes an alternative to traditional HCI and design methods that falsely perpetuate a lens of neutrality and colorblindness that centers on whiteness, innovation, and capitalism and ignores the history of State-sanctioned violence and structural oppression.

Air pointing: Design and evaluation of spatial target acquisition with and without visual feedback	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article						Target acquisition; Proprioception; Spatial memory; Eyes-free interaction	INFORMATION; MOVEMENTS	Sensing technologies such as inertia tracking and computer vision enable spatial interactions where users make selections by 'air pointing': moving a limb, finger, or device to a specific spatial region. In addition of expanding the vocabulary of possible interactions available, air pointing brings the potential benefit of enabling 'eyes-free' interactions, where users rely on proprioception and kinaesthesia rather than vision. This paper explores the design space for air pointing interactions, and presents tangible results in the form of a framework that helps designers understand input dimensions and resulting interaction qualities. The framework provides a set of fundamental concepts that aid in thinking about the air pointing domain, in characterizing and comparing existing solutions, and in evaluating novel techniques. We carry out an initial investigation to demonstrate the concepts of the framework by designing and comparing three air pointing techniques: one based on small angular 'raycasting' movements, one on large movements across a 2D plane, and one on movements in a 3D volume. Results show that large movements on the 2D plane are both rapid (selection times under 1 s) and accurate, even without visual feedback. Raycasting is rapid but inaccurate, and the 3D volume is expressive but slow, inaccurate, and effortful. Many other findings emerge, such as selection point 'drift' in the absence of feedback. These results and the organising framework provide a foundation for innovation and understanding of air pointing interaction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To design an assignment for second-professional year pharmacy students to assess the accuracy and quality of health information published in the news. Design. Students in a literature evaluation course were assigned a health-related news publication to review and find the original published research article. They then critically evaluated the quality and accuracy of the news publication based on the original research. All students wrote a critique focusing on the quality and accuracy of the news article and potential responses the lay public might have. Assessment. Eighty-four percent of students agreed the writing assignment reinforced critical literature evaluation skills, while 90% agreed the assignment contributed to completion of course objectives. Conclusions. A writing assignment requiring comparison of a news publication to the original research reinforces critical literature evaluation and communication skills, as well as stimulates thought about the accuracy, quality, and public responses to health information published in the news.

Exploring potential cognitive foundations of scientific literacy in preschoolers: Causal reasoning and executive function	EARLY CHILDHOOD RESEARCH QUARTERLY			English	Article						Causal reasoning; Executive function; Science; Education	WORKING-MEMORY; YOUNG-CHILDREN; SCIENCE ACHIEVEMENT; THINKING; CLASSROOM; FALSE; INSTRUCTION; INFORMATION; IMPUTATION; PREMISES	Despite increasing emphasis in the United States on promoting student engagement and achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, the origins of scientific literacy remain poorly understood. We begin to address this limitation by considering the potential contributions of two distinct domain-general skills to early scientific literacy. Given their relevance to making predictions and evaluating evidence, we consider the degree to which causal reasoning skills relate to scientific literacy (as measured by an adaptive standardized test specifically designed for preschoolers). We also consider executive function (EF) as a potentially more fundamental contributor. While previous research has demonstrated that EF is predictive of achievement in other core academic domains like reading and math, its relationship to scientific literacy, particularly in early childhood, has received little attention. To examine how causal reasoning and EF together potentially relate to the development of scientific literacy in young children, we recruited 125 3-year-olds to complete three causal reasoning tasks, three EF tasks, and the aforementioned measure of scientific literacy. Results from a series of hierarchical regressions revealed that EF, and one measure of causal reasoning (causal inferencing) were related to scientific literacy, even after controlling for age, ethnicity, maternal education, and vocabulary knowledge. Moreover, causal inferencing ability was a significant partial mediator between EF and scientific literacy. Although additional research will be required to further specify the nature of these relationships, the current work suggests that EF has the potential to support scientific literacy, perhaps in part, by scaffolding causal reasoning skills.

Designing an Educational Website to Improve Quality of Supportive Oncology Care for Women with Ovarian Cancer: An Expert Usability Review and Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION			English	Article							RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PALLIATIVE CARE; USER ACCEPTANCE; OLDER-ADULTS; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; BLUNTING STYLES; HEALTH; MANAGEMENT; INTERVENTIONS; INTERNET	A broad-based research team developed a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant educational website for women with ovarian cancer to improve the quality of supportive oncology care. Prior to a randomized clinical trial of the website, initial usability testing was implemented to evaluate the website. The initial review found that 165/247 checklist items had sufficient information to allow for evaluation with the website achieving an overall score of 63%. By category, the lowest scores were for the Home Page, Task Orientation, Page Layout & Visual Design, and Help, Feedback & Error Tolerance. Major issues thought to potentially impede actual usage were prioritized in redevelopment and the second usability review, conducted by the same expert, saw an improvement in scores. Incorporating usability concepts from the start of development, fulfilling the positive expectations of end-users, and identifying the technical and personal factors that optimize use may greatly enhance the usage of health websites.

Aberrant salience network (bilateral insula and anterior cingulate cortex) connectivity during information processing in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Functional network connectivity; Salience network	DEFAULT-MODE; BRAIN; RESPONSES; DOPAMINE; FMRI	A salience network, comprising bilateral insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), is thought to play a role in recruiting relevant brain regions for the processing of sensory information. Here, we present a functional network connectivity (FNC) analysis of spatial networks identified during somatosensation, performed to test the hypothesis that salience network connectivity is disturbed during information processing in schizophrenia. 19 medicated individuals with schizophrenia and 19 matched healthy controls participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. 100 Hz vibrotactile stimuli were presented to the right index fingertip while whole-head blood oxygenation level-dependent contrast gradient-echo echo-planar images were acquired. Six spatial components of interest were identified using group independent component analysis: (1) bilateral insula, superior temporal and precentral gyrus (INS); (2) dorsal ACC; (3) left dorsolateral frontal and parietal cortex (left central executive network (LCEN)); (4) right dorsolateral frontal and parietal cortex (RCEN); (5) ventromedial frontal cortex (FDMN); and (6) precuneus, posterior cingulate and angular gyrus (PDMN). Maximal-lagged correlation was examined between all pairwise combinations of components. Significantly reduced FNC was observed in schizophrenia compared to controls between: INS and ACC; INS and FDMN; and LCEN and PDMN. There was no evidence of increased FNC in schizophrenia. Reduced salience network connectivity during information processing in schizophrenia suggests disturbance to the system which effects changes between contextually-relevant functional brain states. This aberrance may provide a mechanistic explanation of several clinical features of the disorder. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In fact, persons with communications needs can take advantage of new devices and mobile applications to interact and communicate easily and in the most straightforward way. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems are oriented to users who cannot use natural language due to temporary or permanent impairments, providing an alternative to natural language for communication. In this paper, we present design guidelines for easy communication application (ECO), an AAC tool designed with a user-centered design approach to make functional communication easier for individuals with complex communication needs. ECO tool has two well-defined modules: the Communication User and the Communication Manager. The former is thought as an AAC tool, while the Communication Manager module provides a way to edit the content and fit the dynamics of use and application design to the user's interests. In addition, we present an evaluation of the ECO tool from two different perspectives. On the one hand, we have achieved a heuristic-based expert evaluation in order to analyze the functionality corresponding to the Communication Manager module of the tool, in order to check main accessibility requirements and improve functionality accordingly. On the other hand, we have evaluated both the communication manager and communication user modules in a real context, carrying out a qualitative evaluation with final users and their therapists to check whether the tool is useful in concrete daily scenarios. Results corroborate research questions, demonstrating that ECO meets the most important accessibility requirements and it is highly valued by experts and end-users.

This paper aims to investigate the resources used by health care professionals while searching for medical images. Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on a qualitative study that uses the Straussian version of grounded theory and involved 29 health care professionals from various health and biomedical departments working within Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS (National Health Service) Foundation Trust. Data collection was carried out using semi-structured interviews and think-aloud protocols. Findings - The findings show that health care professionals seek medical images in a variety of visual information sources, including those found online and from published medical literature. The research also identified a number of difficulties that health care professionals face when searching for medical images in various image resources. Originality/value - There have been few studies that investigated the image resources used by health care professionals. Thus, this study contributes to the understanding of medical image resources and information needs of health care professionals. A clear understanding of the medical image information needs of health care professionals is also vital to the design process and development of medical image retrieval systems.

Shutdowns and distancing requirements accelerated the adoption of technology as an educational tool, in some instances supplanting in-person education entirely. Despite the limitations of remote interaction, many educa-tional advantages were recognized that can be leveraged in developing distance learning paradigms. The specific strategies employed should match modern learning science, enabling both students and educators to mutually grow as lifelong learners. As panel members of the "COVID: Faculty perspective" Task Force of the Association of University Radiologists Radiology Research Alliance, we present a review of key learning principles which educators can use to identify techniques that enhance resident learning and present an organized framework for applying technology-aided techniques aligned with modern learning principles. Our aim is to facilitate the purposeful inte-gration of learning tools into the training environment by matching these tools to established educational frameworks. With these frame-works in mind, radiology educators have the opportunity to re-think the balance between traditional curricular design and modern digital teaching tools and models.

Additionally, there remains limited sex/gender reporting in clinical trial research. Objectives The overall goal of this project was to disseminate sex/gender knowledge and build capacity for patient engagement in clinical trials. Specific objectives were to (1) create capacity and identify opportunities for patient engagement in clinical trials and sponsor- or investigator-led activities (e.g. clinical trial design and conduct); and (2) enhance new/early investigator sex/gender knowledge and skills related to patient-oriented research (POR). Methods We used the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR) Capacity Development Framework and the SPOR Patient Engagement Framework to guide three phases of this project: (1) conduct a scoping review using methods described by the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information (EPPI) and the Coordinating Centre at the Institute of Education (Phase 1); (2) host a 1-day POR consultation workshop (Phase 2); and (3) deliver a new/early investigator POR training day (Phase 3). Six electronic databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo, the Cochrane Library, and AMED) were searched from 1996 using keywords and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms in accordance with the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) and the search criteria in the bibliographic databases. Standard approaches were used to search the grey literature. Results A total of 79 studies and over 150 websites were subject to data abstraction by team members, capturing information on sex/gender and SPOR's patient engagement guiding principles of inclusiveness, support, mutual respect, and co-building. Results were presented to 32 key stakeholders at the consultation workshop and input was sought on next steps using nominal group techniques. Based on the plethora of existing POR resources, relevant POR information from the scoping review was collated into two decision aids (patient and investigator) to determine readiness to engage with/as a patient partner in a clinical trial. The decision aids were presented at a POR training day with 88 new/early investigators, clinicians, patient partners and decision makers. The decision aids showed 'good' usability, assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS). Attendees thought the decision aids were engaging, they increased their understanding of sex/gender, patient engagement and POR, and they would recommend them to others. POR principles and practices were integrated across all phases of the project. Patient partners (1) identified research priorities/search terms; (2) collected/analyzed data; (3) designed the patient partner decision aid; and (4) disseminated the results through presentation. Conclusion Our digital patient partner and investigator decision aids are the first to provide information technology to deliver sex/gender, POR knowledge, and decision support beyond the traditional decision aids used for health screening and/or treatment decisions. The decision aids have the potential to make a significant contribution to Canada's Strategy for POR and support the collaborative efforts of patients and investigators to build a sustainable, accessible and equitable health care system. Plain Language Summary The goal of this project was to improve sex/gender knowledge and help patients and investigators work together as partners in clinical trials. There were three phases to this project: Phase 1, search the literature to see what others had done; Phase 2, share the results of Phase 1 with key stakeholders to determine gaps, and develop tools to fill the gaps; and Phase 3, share the tools developed in Phase 2 with others to get feedback. We worked with Clinical Trials Ontario and other key stakeholders to make two decision aids-one for patients and one for investigators. The decision aids share sex/gender knowledge and information about patient-oriented research. Each decision aid has five parts: (1)Introduction(get the facts); (2)My Priorities(patient partner and investigator priorities); (3)Learn More(information on sex/gender and other resources to help patients and investigators work together); (4)My Readiness(comparing priorities with benefits and risks); and (5)My Decision(decision and next steps). Patients, investigators, and other key stakeholders really liked the decision aids and found them easy to move through, they had useful information, and they looked good. Comments included "I enjoyed that the decision aids were separated for patients and investigators"; "I liked it, it was user-friendly and easy to navigate"; and "there could be more interaction and aimed more for mobile devices". These decision aids are the first to provide knowledge and support beyond the standard decision aids used for health decisions. Next steps include getting more feedback and using the decision aids in a laboratory and then in a real-life setting and see if people still like them.

We disagree. Overvaluing experiments results in their overuse both by researchers and decision makers and in an underappreciation of their shortcomings. Neglect of other methods often follows. Experiments can suggest whether X causes Y in a specific experimental setting; however, they often fail to elucidate either the mechanisms responsible for an effect or the strength of an effect in everyday natural settings. In this article, we consider two overarching issues. First, experiments have important limitations. We highlight problems with external, construct, statistical-conclusion, and internal validity; replicability; and conceptual issues associated with simple X causes Y thinking. Second, quasi-experimental and nonexperimental methods are absolutely essential. As well as themselves estimating causal effects, these other methods can provide information and understanding that goes beyond that provided by experiments. A research program progresses best when experiments are not treated as privileged but instead are combined with these other methods.

Participants were instructed to encode the position of a convex target presented in a simple map without a time limit. Immediately after encoding the map, participants were presented with a referent space and asked to place a disc at the same location from memory. All spaces were designed as tactile graphics. Positions of targets varied along the horizontal dimension. The referent space was constant in size while sizes of maps were systematically varied, resulting in three scaling factor conditions: 1:4, 1:2, 1:1. Sixty adults participated in the study (M = 21.18; SD = 1.05). One-third of them was blindfolded throughout the entire experiment (haptic condition). The second group of participants was allowed to see the graphics (visual condition); the third group were instructed to see and touch the graphics (bimodal condition). An analysis of participants' absolute errors showed that participants produced larger errors in the haptic condition as opposed to the visual and bimodal conditions. There was also a significant interaction effect between scaling factor and perceptual condition. In the visual and bimodal conditions, results showed a linear increase in errors with higher scaling factors (which may suggest that adults adopted mental transformation strategies during the spatial scaling process), whereas, in the haptic condition, this relation was quadratic. Findings imply that adults' spatial-scaling performance decreases when visual information is not available.

J	Bruineberg, J; Withagen, R; van Dijk, L				Bruineberg, Jelle; Withagen, Rob; van Dijk, Ludger			Productive Pluralism: The Coming of Age of Ecological Psychology	PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						ecological psychology; affordance; information; explanation; ontology	SELF-ORGANIZATION; AFFORDANCES; PERCEPTION; INFORMATION; NEUROSCIENCE; CONSTRAINTS; MECHANISMS; SYSTEMS	The ecological approach to psychology has been a main antecedent of embodied and situated approaches to cognition. The concept of affordances in particular has gained currency throughout psychological science. Yet, contemporary ecological psychology has seemed inaccessible to outsiders and protective of its legacy. Indeed, some prominent ecological psychologists have presented their approach as a "package deal"-a principled and unified perspective on perception and action. Looking at the history of the field, however, we argue that ecological psychology has developed in rich and pluriform ways. Aiming to open the field to critical engagement and productive exchange, we identify three major strands of thought within ecological psychology, each of which emerged in the 20 years after Gibson's death: physical, biological, and social ecological psychology. Each of these strands develop ecological ideas in quite different directions, making different use of some of its central concepts, adopting different explanatory principles, and embodying different philosophical worldviews. Proponents of the ecological approach have been arguing for pluralism within cognitive science to make room for ecological psychology. Given the diversity of the strands, we extend this plea to within ecological psychology itself; the field is better off aiming for a productive pluralism in which the different strands are in dialogue with each other.

Implementation of Artificial Intelligence in Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy	EUROPEAN UROLOGY OPEN SCIENCE			English	Article						Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy; Kidney stones; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Neural network	KIDNEY-STONES; UROLITHIASIS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; TRENDS	Background: Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) of kidney stones is losing ground to more expensive and invasive endoscopic treatments. Objective: This proof-of-concept project was initiated to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-augmented ESWL and to investigate the potential for machine learning to improve the efficacy of ESWL. Design, setting, and participants: Two-dimensional ultrasound videos were captured during ESWL treatments from an inline ultrasound device with a video grabber. An observer annotated 23 212 images from 11 patients as either in or out of focus. The median hit rate was calculated on a patient level via bootstrapping. A convolutional neural network with U-Net architecture was trained on 57 ultrasound images with delineated kidney stones from the same patients annotated by a second observer. We tested U-Net on the ultrasound images annotated by the first observer. Cross-validation with a training set of nine patients, a validation set of one patient, and a test set of one patient was performed. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Classical metrics describing classifier performance were calculated, together with an estimation of how the algorithm would affect shock wave hit rate. Results and limitations: The median hit rate for standard ESWL was 55.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 43.2-67.3%). The performance metrics for U-Net were accuracy 63.9%, sensitivity 56.0%, specificity 74.7%, positive predictive value 75.3%, negative predictive value 55.2%, Youden's J statistic 30.7%, no-information rate 58.0%, and Cohen's kappa 0.2931. The algorithm reduced total mishits by 67.1%. The main limitation is that this is a proof-of-concept study involving only 11 patients. Conclusions: Our calculated ESWL hit rate of 55.2% (95% CI 43.2-67.3%) supports findings from earlier research. We have demonstrated that a machine learning algorithm trained on just 11 patients increases the hit rate to 75.3% and reduces mishits by 67.1%. When U-Net is trained on more and higher-quality annotations, even better results can be expected. Patient summary: Kidney stones can be treated by applying shockwaves to the outside of the body. Ultrasound scans of the kidney are used to guide the machine delivering the shockwaves, but the shockwaves can still miss the stone. We used artificial intelligence to improve the accuracy in hitting the stone being treated. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Association of Urology.

SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						educational inequality; ICT; transportation infrastructure; sustainable economic growth	ECONOMIC-GROWTH; ICT; INCOME; OPPORTUNITY; CAUSALITY; SCHOOLS	Educational inequality is an important factor in the development of human capital, and limits the output of regional economic activities. The unequal distribution of educational resources has become a hot topic noticed by the public, and has restricted sustainable economic growth. This paper provides a better understanding of educational inequality, and explores the impacts of information and communication technology (ICT) and transportation infrastructure on the distribution of educational resources. The panel data models are constructed to discuss the relationship among ICT, transportation infrastructure, and educational inequality, using the data of 31 provinces in China from 2006 to 2016. The empirical results show that there is a positive relationship between ICT and educational inequality, while transportation infrastructure can restrain the unequal distribution of educational resources. Moreover, there is a significant inverted U-shaped relationship between transportation infrastructure and educational inequality. Since China's education reform in 2010, the relationship among ICT, transportation infrastructure, and educational inequality has been significantly changed, as well as the influence mechanism of ICT. In addition, transportation infrastructure in China western regions can effectively alleviate the problem of educational inequality, and its impact will increase with the growth of transportation investments. It is necessary to consider the rational allocation of educational resources, and this is essential to relieve the problem of educational inequality. Therefore, our results demonstrate the key roles of information technology and transportation network in the field of education, and provide some new ideas for the solution of educational inequality.

With the advent of the "Internet+" era, the development of digital media technology, digitization, and informatization has been integrated into all walks of life and has a vital impact on the development of all walks of life, and also brought about the ideological change of fine arts. Nowadays, the digitization of fine arts is a new product of the computer age, and how to protect it is also an important topic. The continuous development of wireless mobile communications has promoted the rapid development of microprocessors. In this article, we will study the protective effect of microprocessors on the digitization of fine arts. This paper designs a microprocessor-based art digital protection website, with the purpose of preserving, inheriting, and disseminating folk art works through the website. The result of the experiment shows that the sampling rate of the microprocessor has reached the requirement of the signal. The largest number of users of the folk art digital website is young people aged 18-29, accounting for 32%; the highest average score for the website is those over 59 years old, with an average score of 90.

We aimed to investigate beliefs about COVID-19 diagnosis, transmission and prevention that have the potential to impact the uptake of recommended public health strategies. Design An online cross-sectional survey. Participants A national sample of 1500 Australian adults with representative quotas for age and gender provided by an online panel provider. Main outcome measure Proportion of participants with correct/incorrect knowledge of COVID-19 preventive behaviours and reasons for misconceptions. Results Of the 1802 potential participants contacted, 289 did not qualify, 13 declined and 1500 participated in the survey (response rate 83%). Most participants correctly identified 'washing your hands regularly with soap and water' (92%) and 'staying at least 1.5 m away from others' (90%) could help prevent COVID-19. Over 40% (incorrectly) considered wearing gloves outside of the home would prevent them from contracting COVID-19. Views about face masks were divided. Only 66% of participants correctly identified that 'regular use of antibiotics' would not prevent COVID-19. Most participants (90%) identified 'fever, fatigue and cough' as indicators of COVID-19. However, 42% of participants thought that being unable to 'hold your breath for 10 s without coughing' was an indicator of having the virus. The most frequently reported sources of COVID-19 information were commercial television channels (56%), the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (43%) and the Australian Government COVID-19 information app (31%). Conclusions Public messaging about hand hygiene and physical distancing to prevent transmission appears to have been effective. However, there are clear, identified barriers for many individuals that have the potential to impede uptake or maintenance of these behaviours in the long term. We need to develop public health messages that harness these barriers to improve future cooperation. Ensuring adherence to these interventions is critical.

J	Zhao, J; Guo, L; Li, YQ				Zhao, Jing; Guo, Lei; Li, Yueqiao			Application of Digital Twin Combined with Artificial Intelligence and 5G Technology in the Art Design of Digital Museums	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article								More and more museums are being established or restored as people's cultural levels grow. A digital twin is a computerized representation of the physical object or phenomenon, which acts as its real-time digital equivalent. Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly widespread, and museums and art shows will need to change their old working and thinking processes to fully fulfill their potential. In an increasingly digital world, combining AI technologies and wearable devices into digital museums could assist in boosting involvement. It is necessary to investigate AI's strategic function and application in affecting tourist experiences at art galleries and museums, as well as its potential to improve education. Also, digital twin (DT) paves the way to alleviate difficulties or might improve access to digital museums via digital experiences. The historical report recommends that digital museum items be represented in a way that poses the fewest threats to its legitimacy. Owing to its uniqueness and vulnerability to substantial environmental dangers, the safeguarding of art and cultural heritage in digital museums is a serious issue. There are many approaches for assessing the state of artistic heritage and protecting it from extreme acts. The current study offers a framework for digitized museum art design based on the utilization of digital twin (DT), artificial intelligence (AI), and fifth-generation (5G) technologies. Further to enhance the security of the system, we employ the improved blowfish encryption algorithm (IBEA). Also, the authentication is done using the Diffie-Hellman protocol. The proposed system is simulated using MATLAB, and its performance is analyzed and compared with conventional systems. From the result obtained, it was revealed that the suggested methodology express high range of security level (95%) than the existing mechanisms. This study is very important in two directions: (1) it presents an analytical structure for having to adapt digital information to complicated systems in museums and (2) it explains the artistic obstacles for heritage properties, such as accessibility, execution time, security level, and the efficiency of 3-dimensional designs.

J	Burdon, G				Burdon, George			Immunological atmospheres: Ambient music and the design of self-experience	CULTURAL GEOGRAPHIES			English	Article						affect; ambient music; atmosphere; Deleuze and Guattari; media; Sloterdijk	THINKING; MEDIA; MUZAK	This paper examines the cultural popularity of 'ambient music' playlists on digital streaming platforms as a paradigm of the technical fabrication of atmospheres and the modulation of affect in some of the media environments of contemporary capitalism. Ambient music names a style of non-intrusive, gentle background music designed to assist the listener in relaxing or focussing on work. At the centre of the paper is the argument that ambient music demonstrates how the intimate tonalities of human behaviour are increasingly shaped through media technologies in ways that hold significant implications for how we feel and perceive our senses of being in the world today. Developing this argument, the paper advances two claims. First, drawing on the work of Peter Sloterdijk, that ambient music exemplifies the 'immunological' character of atmospheric envelopment. Second, that ambient music points towards the role of digital technologies capable of supporting new atmospheric envelopments as facilitating what Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari call 'investments of desire', new conjunctions between flows of information, behaviours, value and affects that are central to the processes of contemporary capitalism. Finally, the paper speculates on ambient music in its relation to the atmospheric conditions of life in contemporary capitalist societies.

J	Holohan, M; Fiske, A				Holohan, Michael; Fiske, Amelia			"Like I'm Talking to a Real Person": Exploring the Meaning of Transference for the Use and Design of AI-Based Applications in Psychotherapy	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						artificial intelligence; psychotherapy; mental healthcare; chatbots; transference; embedded ethics; science and technology studies; agential realism	HEALTH; COUNTERTRANSFERENCE; ROBOTS	AI-enabled virtual and robot therapy is increasingly being integrated into psychotherapeutic practice, supporting a host of emotional, cognitive, and social processes in the therapeutic encounter. Given the speed of research and development trajectories of AI-enabled applications in psychotherapy and the practice of mental healthcare, it is likely that therapeutic chatbots, avatars, and socially assistive devices will soon translate into clinical applications much more broadly. While AI applications offer many potential opportunities for psychotherapy, they also raise important ethical, social, and clinical questions that have not yet been adequately considered for clinical practice. In this article, we begin to address one of these considerations: the role of transference in the psychotherapeutic relationship. Drawing on Karen Barad's conceptual approach to theorizing human-non-human relations, we show that the concept of transference is necessarily reconfigured within AI-human psychotherapeutic encounters. This has implications for understanding how AI-driven technologies introduce changes in the field of traditional psychotherapy and other forms of mental healthcare and how this may change clinical psychotherapeutic practice and AI development alike. As more AI-enabled apps and platforms for psychotherapy are developed, it becomes necessary to re-think AI-human interaction as more nuanced and richer than a simple exchange of information between human and nonhuman actors alone.

De-novo design of complementary (antisense) peptide mini-receptor inhibitor of interleukin 18 (IL-18)	MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						interleukin-18; complementary peptides; proteomic code; molecular recognition		Complementary (antisense) peptide mini-receptor inhibitors are complementary peptides designed to be receptor-surrogates that act by binding to selected surface features of biologically important proteins thereby inhibiting protein-cognate receptor interactions and subsequent biological effects. Previously, we described a complementary peptide mini-receptor inhibitor of interleukin-1 kappa (IL-1 kappa) that was designed to bind to an external surface loop (beta-bulge) of IL-1 beta (Boraschi loop) clearly identified in the X-ray crystal structure of this cytokine. Here, we report the de-novo design and rational development of a complementary peptide mini-receptor inhibitor of cytokine interleukin- 18 (IL-18), a protein for which there is no known X-ray crystal structure. Using sequence homology comparisons with IL-1 kappa, putative IL-18 surface loops are identified and used as a starting point for design, including a loop region 1 thought to be equivalent with the Boraschi loop of IL-1 kappa. Only loop region 1 complementary peptides are found to be promising leads as mini-receptor inhibitors of IL-18 but these are prevented from being properly successful owing to solubility problems. The application of "M-I pair mutagenesis" and inclusion of a C-terminal arginine residue are then sufficient to solve this problem and convert one lead peptide into a functional complementary peptide mini-receptor inhibitor of IL-18. This suggests that the biophysical and biological properties of complementary peptides can be improved in a rational and logical manner where appropriate, further strengthening the potential importance of complementary peptides as inhibitors of protein-protein interactions, even when X-ray crystal structural information is not readily available.

In an unsolicited, mailed survey, we assessed participants' change in affect post-survey after altering key cover letter information and promising different incentives. We tested direct and indirect effects of participants carefully reading the cover letter on changes in their affect post-survey.Methods: In a 3X2X2 randomized, factorial trial, 480 male and 480 female, nationally representative Veterans who were applying for posttraumatic stress disorder disability benefits were randomized to receive one of 12 different cover letters. The cover letters provided general versus more explicit information about the survey's trauma content and how their names were selected for study; we also promised different incentives for returning the survey. The main outcome was change in affect post-survey. We examined five potential moderators: combat or military sexual trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress disorder or serious mental illness diagnosis, and recency of military service. Mediators between reading the cover letter carefully and post-survey affect included how participants rated the cover letters' information and whether they thought the cover letters prepared them for the survey's content. A Bonferroni corrected alpha of 0.003 was the threshold for statistical significance.Results: One hundred ninety men and 193 women reported their pre-and post-survey affect. Across all study conditions, out of 16 possible points, the net change in affect post-survey was less than a quarter-point for men and women. Mean changes in post-survey affect did not differ statistically significantly across any of the study factors (ps > 0.06); nor were there statistically significant interactions between any of the study factors and the 5 moderators after accounting for multiple comparisons (ps > 0.02). After controlling for pre-survey affect, reading the cover letter carefully had small effects on changes in post-survey affect, with larger associations seen in the women compared to men. Mediators' effects were often in opposite directions for men and women.Conclusion: General descriptions of a survey's trauma content appear ethically defensible. Research on cover letters' impacts on survey participants' emotional reactions and how those impacts differ by gender is needed.

J	Li, SQ; Peng, T; Wang, JF; Xu, C				Li Shiqi; Peng Tao; Wang Junfeng; Xu Chi			Mixed Reality-based Interactive Technology for Aircraft Cabin Assembly	CHINESE JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						virtual assembly; human-computer interaction; mixed reality; information augmentation; constraints navigation	DESIGN	Due to the narrowness of space and the complexity of structure, the assembly of aircraft cabin has become one of the major bottlenecks in the whole manufacturing process. To solve the problem, at the beginning of aircraft design, the different stages of the lifecycle of aircraft must be thought about, which include the trial manufacture, assembly, maintenance, recycling and destruction of the product. Recently, thanks to the development of the virtual reality and augmented reality, some low-cost and fast solutions are found for the product assembly. This paper presents a mixed reality-based interactive technology for the aircraft cabin assembly, which can enhance the efficiency of the assemblage in a virtual environment in terms of vision, information and operation. In the mixed reality-based assembly environment, the physical scene can be obtained by a camera and then generated by a computer. The virtual parts, the features of visual assembly, the navigation information, the physical parts and the physical assembly environment will be mixed and presented in the same assembly scene. The mixed or the augmented information will provide some assembling information as a detailed assembly instruction in the mixed reality-based assembly environment. Constraint proxy and its match rules help to reconstruct and visualize the restriction relationship among different parts, and to avoid the complex calculation of constraint's match. Finally, a desktop prototype system of virtual assembly has been built to assist the assembly verification and training with the virtual hand.

Diversity of Participation in Clinical Trials and Influencing Factors: Findings from the Health Information National Trends Survey 2020	JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						clinical trials; diversity; NCI; HINTS; health equity	BLACK; MISTRUST; ENGAGEMENT	Background Clinical trial diversity is critical to advance health and health equity. Research addressing the discrepancy between goals of achieving clinical trial diversity and realities of study enrollment remains underdeveloped. Objective This study aims to examine the association between race/ethnicity and clinical trial invitation, participation, knowledge, and sources of influence on clinical trial participation. Design and Participants A cross-sectional, observational study using nationally representative data from 3689 US adults (>= 18 years of age) who responded to the Health Information National Trends Survey fielded from February 24 to June 15, 2020. Main Measures Primary outcomes included clinical trial invitation, participation, knowledge, and sources of influence on participation. The independent variable of interest is self-reported race/ethnicity. Key Results Respondents identifying as non-Hispanic Black (relative to non-Hispanic White) had higher odds of being invited into a clinical trial (adjusted odds ratio: 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 3.7), but no differences in odds of participation were observed by race/ethnicity. Respondents from all races/ethnicities reported that personal healthcare providers were the most trusted source of clinical trial information. Hispanic (marginal effect (ME): - 0.09; 95% CI: - 0.16, - 0.03), non-Hispanic Black (ME: - 0.11; 95% CI: - 0.18, - 0.04), and non-Hispanic other (ME: - 0.11; 95% CI: - 0.19, - 0.02) respondents had lower odds than non-Hispanic White respondents of saying they would be influenced "a lot" by their doctor encouraging participation. Non-Hispanic Black respondents had significantly lower odds (relative to non-Hispanic White) of indicating family encouragement would influence their clinical trial participation decision "a lot" (ME: - 0.09; 95%: CI: - 0.14, - 0.03). Conclusion While personal healthcare providers were trusted sources of information, racial/ethnic minority populations noted lower odds of clinical trial participation influence from providers and family. Thus, it is imperative for the healthcare, government, and industry organizations to build trust in medicine and science.

The manual design of such neural architectures is an error-prone and time-consuming process. The search for optimal CNN architectures is considered a revolution in the design of neural networks. By means of Neural Architecture Search (NAS), network architectures can be designed and optimized automatically. Thus, the optimal CNN architecture representation can be found automatically because of its ability to overcome the limitations of human experience and thinking modes. Evolution algorithms, which are derived from evolutionary mechanisms such as natural selection and genetics, have been widely employed to develop and optimize NAS because they can handle a blackbox optimization process for designing appropriate solution representations and search paradigms without explicit mathematical formulations or gradient information. The Genetic optimization algorithm (GA) is widely used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions for difficult problems. Considering these characteristics, an efficient human activity recognition architecture (AUTO-HAR) is presented in this study. Using the evolutionary GA to select the optimal CNN architecture, the current study proposes a novel encoding schema structure and a novel search space with a much broader range of operations to effectively search for the best architectures for HAR tasks. In addition, the proposed search space provides a reasonable degree of depth because it does not limit the maximum length of the devised task architecture. To test the effectiveness of the proposed framework for HAR tasks, three datasets were utilized: UCI-HAR, Opportunity, and DAPHNET. Based on the results of this study, it has been found that the proposed method can efficiently recognize human activity with an average accuracy of 98.5% (-/+ 1.1), 98.3%, and 99.14% (-/+ 0.8) for UCI-HAR, Opportunity, and DAPHNET, respectively.

Understanding how intelligence originated and scaled during evolution is a key challenge for modern biology. Some of the most important approaches to understanding intelligence are the ongoing efforts to build new intelligences in computer science (AI) and bioengineering. However, progress has been stymied by a lack of multidisciplinary consensus on what is central about intelligence regardless of the details of its material composition or origin (evolved vs. engineered). We show that Buddhist concepts offer a unique perspective and facilitate a consilience of biology, cognitive science, and computer science toward understanding intelligence in truly diverse embodiments. In coming decades, chimeric and bioengineering technologies will produce a wide variety of novel beings that look nothing like familiar natural life forms; how shall we gauge their moral responsibility and our own moral obligations toward them, without the familiar touchstones of standard evolved forms as comparison? Such decisions cannot be based on what the agent is made of or how much design vs. natural evolution was involved in their origin. We propose that the scope of our potential relationship with, and so also our moral duty toward, any being can be considered in the light of Care-a robust, practical, and dynamic lynchpin that formalizes the concepts of goal-directedness, stress, and the scaling of intelligence; it provides a rubric that, unlike other current concepts, is likely to not only survive but thrive in the coming advances of AI and bioengineering. We review relevant concepts in basal cognition and Buddhist thought, focusing on the size of an agent's goal space (its cognitive light cone) as an invariant that tightly links intelligence and compassion. Implications range across interpersonal psychology, regenerative medicine, and machine learning. The Bodhisattva's vow ("for the sake of all sentient life, I shall achieve awakening") is a practical design principle for advancing intelligence in our novel creations and in ourselves.

While there are quite a few review studies of dynamic capabilities (DCs) in the strategic management domain, research on DCs in the IS area has not been synthesized nor critically analyzed. The result is that the role that IT plays in the DCV remains largely ambiguous, and the way we think and conduct IS research on DCs is unquestioned. Addressing this, we conducted a critical review of DCs in IS research based on 136 papers. Our review provides a synthesis of contemporary knowledge on DCs that emphasizes the role of IT in this research, and a critical analysis of the assumptions underlying this literature. In addition, we develop a minimum DC definition for future research as a solution to the conceptual issues that we uncovered via the critical analysis. We further leverage the remaining findings of our critical review by providing a detailed research agenda for future investigations on DCs by IS scholars.

J	Jaglarz, A				Jaglarz, Anna			Perception of Color in Architecture and Urban Space	BUILDINGS			English	Article						architecture design; urban space design; color design; color perception; color harmony; color scheme; color composition; architectural education		The various colors and color combinations in an urban environment are perceived and experienced individually. The article indicates the important role of color in shaping architecture and urban space. The paper discusses the theories of color harmony as an aesthetic principle in architectural design. The results of the research have proven the significant role of color as an element of the composition of urban space affecting the observer. This translates into the importance of color in architectural design, taking into account the difficulty and ambiguity in predicting color aesthetics; the impact of color on humans; and its cognitive, emotional and behavioral effects. The information and conclusions obtained as a result of the literature studies and the results of the survey gave the basis for determining various color strategies in shaping architecture and the effects that we can achieve in urban space thanks to a well-thought-out, conscious use of colors. The research findings also indicate that it is necessary to supplement architectural education programs with broadly understood knowledge about color and its impact on humans. The implemented activities are a response to current ideas and directions in designing and teaching architectural design outlined and suggested as part of the New European Bauhaus initiative.

The aim of this paper is to present the content development process for a mHealth (mobile phone and internet-based) cardiac rehabilitation (CR) exercise intervention. Methods: An innovative mHealth intervention was developed with patient input using the following steps: conceptualization, formative research, pre-testing, and pilot testing. Conceptualization, including theoretical and technical aspects, was undertaken by experts. For the formative component, focus groups and interviews with cardiac patients were conducted to discuss their perceptions of a mHealth CR program. A general inductive thematic approach identified common themes. A preliminary library of text and video messages were then developed. Participants were recruited from CR education sessions to pre-test and provide feedback on the content using an online survey. Common responses were extracted and compiled. An iterative process was used to refine content prior to pilot testing and conduct of a randomized controlled trial. Results: 38 CR patients and 3 CR nurses participated in the formative research and 20 CR patients participated in the content pre-testing. Participants perceived the mHealth program as an effective approach to inform and motivate patients to exercise. For the qualitative study, 100% (n = 41) of participants thought it to be a good idea, and 11% of participants felt it might not be useful for them, but would be for others. Of the 20 participants who completed the online survey, 17 out of 20 (85%) stated they would sign up to a program where they could receive information by video messages on a website, and 12 out of 20 (60%) showed interest in a texting program. Some older CR patients viewed technology as a potential barrier as they were unfamiliar with text messaging or did not have mobile phones. Steps to instruct participants to receive texts and view the website were written into the study protocol. Suggestions to improve videos and wording of texts were fed back to the content development team and refined. Conclusions: Most participants thought a mHealth exercise program was an effective way to deliver exercise-based CR. The results were used to develop an innovative multimedia exercise intervention. A randomized controlled trial is currently underway.

J	Chen, T; Yang, J				Chen, Tong; Yang, Juan			A Novel Multi-Feature Fusion Method in Merging Information of Heterogenous-View Data for Oil Painting Image Feature Extraction and Recognition	FRONTIERS IN NEUROROBOTICS			English	Article						heterogenous-view data; multi-feature fusion; support vector machine; K-nearest neighbor; oil painting image feature extraction; faster RCNN	CLASSIFICATION	The art of oil painting reflects on society in the form of vision, while technology constantly explores and provides powerful possibilities to transform the society, which also includes the revolution in the way of art creation and even the way of thinking. The progress of science and technology often provides great changes for the creation of art, and also often changes people's way of appreciation and ideas. The oil painting image feature extraction and recognition is an important field in computer vision, which is widely used in video surveillance, human-computer interaction, sign language recognition and medical, health care. In the past few decades, feature extraction and recognition have focused on the multi-feature fusion method. However, the captured oil painting image is sensitive to light changes and background noise, which limits the robustness of feature extraction and recognition. Oil painting feature extraction is the basis of feature classification. Feature classification based on a single feature is easily affected by the inaccurate detection accuracy of the object area, object angle, scale change, noise interference and other factors, resulting in the reduction of classification accuracy. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-feature fusion method in merging information of heterogenous-view data for oil painting image feature extraction and recognition in this paper. It fuses the width-to-height ratio feature, rotation invariant uniform local binary mode feature and SIFT feature. Meanwhile, we adopt a modified faster RCNN to extract the semantic feature of oil painting. Then the feature is classified based on the support vector machine and K-nearest neighbor method. The experiment results show that the feature extraction method based on multi-feature fusion can significantly improve the average classification accuracy of oil painting and have high recognition efficiency.

This research is situated in the Irish health reform context of Slaintecare, the reform programme which aims to deliver universal healthcare by strengthening public health, primary and community healthcare functions as well as tackling system and societal health inequities.Aims and objectives This study set out to advance understanding of how and to what extent COVID-19 has highlighted opportunities for change that enabled better access to universal, integrated care in Ireland, with a view to informing universal health system reform and implementation.Methods The study, which is qualitative, was underpinned by a co-production approach with Irish health system leadership. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with sixteen health system professionals (including managers and frontline workers) from a range of responses to explore their experiences and interpretations of social processes of change that enabled (or hindered) better access to universal integrated care during the pandemic. A complexity-informed approach was mobilized to theorize the processes that impacted on access to universal, integrated care in Ireland in the COVID-19 context.Findings A range of circumstances, strategies and mechanisms that created favorable system conditions in which new integrated care trajectories emerged during the crisis. Three key learnings from the pandemic response are presented: (1) nurturing whole-system thinking through a clear, common goal and shared information base; (2) harnessing, sharing and supporting innovation; and (3) prioritizing trust and relationship-building in a social, human-centered health system.

J	Liu, TK; Lin, SS; Hsueh, PW				Liu, Tung-Kung; Lin, Shou-Shan; Hsueh, Po-Wen			Optimal design for transport and logistics of steel mill by-product based on double-layer genetic algorithms	JOURNAL OF LOW FREQUENCY NOISE VIBRATION AND ACTIVE CONTROL			English	Article						By-product; genetic algorithm; artificial intelligence		This paper presents the optimal design of in-plant logistics in manufacturing. Owing to rising energy costs and the supply-demand imbalance leading to price competition, resulting in a sharp decline in profit, business management is facing a severe test, especially heavy industry. In practice, the important decision-making in C Company has relied on expert experience and existing knowledge, the lack of systematic thinking, and technology applications, resulting in a waste of logistics costs. Therefore, a study on the application of genetic algorithms to optimize steel mill factory by-product transport and logistics is presented herein. The aim is to solve the bottleneck of traditional decision-making in order to achieve the goal of optimizing transportation logistics decision-making via artificial intelligence. In defining the problem, the model of the steel mill factory by-products transport and logistics is constructed through in-plant route information, vehicle routing systematization and consideration of the transport demand frequency. The modified variable length chromosome ending technique and bi-level genetic algorithm are used to effectively solve the problem of different zoning transportation on double layer genetic algorithm application. The results show that the total transport time is slightly better than the existing results.

Their effective handling requires a sophisticated database management system. Such a system must be robust enough to efficiently store large amounts of data, and flexible to allow users to manipulate a wide variety of information. In a pilot project, related to a multiresource inventory of the Suwannee River Water Management District holdings in Florida, a new temporal database model is implemented. This model is a relational one with an enhanced entity relationship between component tables. It consists of a superclass, the spatial database index, and a number of subclass component tables related through a unique identifier. This superclass may be thought of as a central repository, where all the sample locations with their rectangular coordinates are stored. In addition, a unique identifier denoting various aspects of the sampling design is associated with the coordinates, The global positioning system is used to reference sample locations for periodic updates. The model is implemented via Oracle's database server. ArcView's Event Theme option is used to integrate the processed data with existing spatial datasets for further analysis. This approach has the advantage of working with smaller sets of data as opposed to the traditional geographic information systems spatial analysis. The ultimate objective is to provide timely, cost-effective and reliable information for making intelligent decisions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhu, JK; Liu, W; Li, W; Lei, J				Zhu, Jinkun; Liu, Wei; Li, Wei; Lei, Jing			Design of a Physical Layer Encryption Scheme for Rate Compatible Modulation	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Encryption; Ciphers; Modulation; Physical layer; Sparse matrices; Rate compatible modulation; physical layer encryption; security; eavesdropper; throughput; BER	SENDING ARTIFICIAL NOISE; SECURE TRANSMISSION; ALGORITHM	Spectral efficiency and transmission security are both essential metrics for wireless communication. Rate compatible modulation (RCM) is an adaptive transmission scheme to improve the spectral efficiency. However, the mapping matrix of RCM is fixed. Once the mapping matrix is known to eavesdroppers, information will be leaked. Physical layer encryption (PLE) is a secure approach to enhance the security using encryption at physical layer. In this paper, we propose a secure transmission scheme for RCM, namely, secure RCM (S-RCM). The construction method of RCM mapping matrix is of great random. Combined with PLE, S-RCM mainly uses the secret key extracted from the channel information to generate mapping matrix. Due to the randomness of channel, the mapping matrix will also be random. Security analysis shows that the demapping of S-RCM must be based on the right mapping matrix. It also shows that S-RCM owns extremely large cipher mapping matrix space, which makes it impossible for eavesdropper to guess the mapping matrix. Furthermore, known-plaintext attack (KPA) is hardly impossible to get the mapping matrix due to the high calculations and multiple possibilities. Simulation result shows that the S-RCM have the same throughput performance and bit error rate (BER) performance as RCM. In addition, the simulation results also show that eavesdropper faces extremely high complexity, which is thought safe.

J	Muranaka, S; Sasaki, J				Muranaka, Seiji; Sasaki, Jun			The Effect of Enumeration of Self-Relevant Words on Self-Focused Attention and Repetitive Negative Thoughts	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						self-focused attention; repetitive negative thinking; self-control; limited resources; self-relevant word	SOCIAL ANXIETY; COGNITIVE LOAD; RUMINATION; DEPLETION	Self-focused attention refers to awareness of self-referent, internally generated information. It can be categorized into dysfunctional (i.e., self-rumination) and functional (self-reflection) aspects. According to theory on cognitive resource limitations (e.g., Moreno, 2006), there is a difference in cognitive resource allocation between these two aspects of self-focused attention. We propose a new task, self-relevant word (SRW) enumeration, that can aid in behaviorally identifying individuals' use of self-rumination and self-reflection. The present study has two purposes: to determine the association between self-focus and SRW enumeration, and to examine the effect of dysfunctional SRW enumeration on repetitive negative thinking. One hundred forty-six undergraduate students participated in this study. They completed a measure of state anxiety twice, before and after imagining a social failure situation. They also completed the SRW enumeration task, Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire, Short Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale, and Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire. A correlational analysis indicated a significant positive correlation between self-reflection and the number of SRWs. Furthermore, individuals high in self-reflection had a tendency to pay more attention to problems than did those high in self-rumination. A significant positive correlation was found between self-rumination and the strength of self-relevance of negative SRWs. Through a path analysis, we found a significant positive effect of the self-relevance of negative SRWs on repetitive negative thinking. Notably, however, the model that excluded self-rumination as an explanatory variable showed a better fit to the data than did the model that included it. In summary, SRW enumeration might enable selective and independent detection of the degree of self-reflection and self-rumination, and therefore should be examined in future research in order to design new behavioral procedures.

J	Lin, M; Liu, LYJ; Pham, TN				Lin, Mei; Liu, Lana Y. J.; Pham, Thinh Ngoc			Towards developing a critical learning skills framework for master?s students: Evidence from a UK university	THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY			English	Article						Critical learning skills; Master ?s students; Learning outcomes	CRITICAL THINKING; POSTGRADUATE; TRANSITION; KNOWLEDGE; UNDERGRADUATE; PERCEPTIONS; ADJUSTMENT; CHALLENGES; STRATEGIES; EXPERIENCE	There are various arguments surrounding critical thinking, from it being an innate ability to its perceived absence due to cultural backgrounds, to diversities in the presentation of critical thinking. Less attention, however, is placed on the cognitive complexity embedded in critical thinking performance, particularly the important role of knowledge understanding and application when becoming a critical thinker. While there are generic statements stipulating learning outcomes and expectations, operationalising them in the curriculum design, learning activities and assessments by students is less transparent. Thus, this study aims to propose and validate a critical learning skills (CLS) framework to contextualise expected learning outcomes through a visual roadmap for successful achievement at the master's level. We assume that being a critical thinker entails various critical learning skills, and that critical thinking performance is closely related to knowledge understanding and application. The CLS framework includes four components: information gathering, building understanding, knowledge application and productive thinking. The descriptors of each component were generated after analysing the keywords stated in the learning outcomes in the qualification descriptors at the master's level in the UK context. A questionnaire and confirmatory factor analysis were used to validate the framework with a sample of 132 master's students from two programs at one UK university. The results indicate that the framework is reliable and valid. The potential of using the CLS framework as a guide for future research and postgraduate teaching and learning are discussed. The framework can be applied to master's programs in other contexts.	[Lin, Mei] Newcastle Univ, Sch Educ Commun & Language Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, England; [Liu, Lana Y.

Data were gathered from individual chain members through qualitative interviews and analyzed according to definitions of concepts in the literature and their arrangements within a conceptual framework. We identified several fragmentations that constrained value chain performance and weakened its integration. The major causes of fragmentation were a lack of value chain thinking, opportunistic traders, weak cooperative organizations, poor information sharing, and less support from the malt factory and breweries to upstream members of the chain. A conceptual framework was designed to guide future analysis, open managerial and policy dialogues, and initiate questions for future research to identify new ways of linking small-scale farmers to the large agro-processors in Sub-Saharan Africa.

However, most acidophiles in AMD environments are uncultured microorganisms and little is known about the diversity of nitrogen-fixing genes and structure of nif gene cluster in AMD microbial communities. In this study, we used metagenomic sequencing to isolate nif genes in the AMD microbial community from Dexing Copper Mine, China. Meanwhile, a metagenome microarray containing 7,776 large-insertion fosmids was constructed to screen novel nif gene clusters. Metagenomic analyses revealed that 742 sequences were identified as nif genes including structural subunit genes nifH, nifD, nifK and various additional genes. The AMD community is massively dominated by the genus Acidithiobacillus. However, the phylogenetic diversity of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms is much higher than previously thought in the AMD community. Furthermore, a 32.5-kb genomic sequence harboring nif, fix and associated genes was screened by metagenome microarray. Comparative genome analysis indicated that most nif genes in this cluster are most similar to those of Herbaspirillum seropedicae, but the organization of the nif gene cluster had significant differences from H. seropedicae. Sequence analysis and reverse transcription PCR also suggested that distinct transcription units of nif genes exist in this gene cluster. nifQ gene falls into the same transcription unit with fixABCX genes, which have not been reported in other diazotrophs before. All of these results indicated that more novel diazotrophs survive in the AMD community.

Visible to Near-Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy of Asteroid (16) Psyche: Implications for the Psyche Mission's Science Investigations	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Psyche; spectroscopy; meteorite; Imager; sulfide; metal	CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITES; IRON-METEORITES; SPECTRA; PETROLOGY; SURFACE; MINERALOGY; CHEMISTRY; ISHEYEVO; SULFIDES; OLIVINE	The NASA Psyche mission will explore the structure, composition, and other properties of asteroid (16) Psyche to test hypotheses about its formation. Variations in radar reflectivity, density, thermal inertia, and visible to near-infrared (VNIR) reflectance spectra of Psyche suggest a highly metallic composition with mafic silicate minerals (e.g., pyroxene) heterogeneously distributed on the surface in low abundance (<10 vol.%). The Psyche spacecraft's Multispectral Imager is designed to map >= 80% of the surface at high spatial resolution (<= 20 m/pixel) through a panchromatic filter and provide compositional information for about >= 80% of the surface using seven narrowband filters at VNIR wavelengths (similar to 400-1,100 nm) and at spatial scales of <= 500 m/pixel. We analyzed 359 reflectance spectra from samples consistent with current uncertainties in Psyche's composition and compared them to published reflectance spectra of the asteroid using a chi-square test for goodness of fit. The best matches for Psyche include iron meteorite powder, powders from the sulfide minerals troilite and pentlandite, and powder from the CH/CBb chondrite Isheyevo. Comparison of absorption features support the interpretation that Psyche's surface is a metal-silicate mixture, although the exact abundance and chemistry of the silicate component remains poorly constrained. We convolve our spectra to the Imager's spectral throughput to demonstrate preliminary strategies for mapping the surface composition of the asteroid using filter ratios and reconstructed band parameters. Our results provide predictions of the kinds of surface compositional information that the Psyche mission could reveal on the solar system's largest M-type asteroid. Plain Language Summary Current observations of the asteroid (16) Psyche suggest it to be metal-rich, but not entirely made of metal. We compared reflected light from a wide variety of Psyche-relevant materials to measurements of reflected light from the asteroid. This analysis confirms that Psyche's composition could be less metal-rich than previously thought. Other materials with reflectance properties similar to Psyche are metal-rich carbonaceous chondrites and sulfide minerals. We show how an instrument on the Psyche spacecraft, which will study the asteroid in detail, can resolve some uncertainties about the surface composition of the asteroid.	[Dibb, S.

Implications for practice: The Arrow Framework will be useful for educators and students in teaching and learning research language, relationships, and application of methods. The materials are easily adaptable to slide or paper presentation, and meet learner needs for narrative and visual presentation. Teaching research design to graduate students is critical to meet the expectation that students are to understand the scientific underpinnings of nursing science and appropriate use of evidence that are essential for well-educated practitioners.

POP-PL: A Patient-Oriented Prescription Programming Language	ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES			English	Article						Design; Human Factors; Languages; DSL Design; Medical Programming Languages; Medical Prescriptions; Empirical Evaluation	SYSTEMS; CARE	Medical professionals have long used algorithmic thinking to describe and implement health care processes without the benefit of the conceptual framework provided by a programming language. Instead, medical algorithms are expressed using English, flowcharts, or data tables. This results in prescriptions that are difficult to understand, hard to debug, and awkward to reuse. This paper reports on the design and evaluation of a domain specific programming language, POP-PL, for expressing medical algorithms. The design draws on the experience of researchers in two disciplines, programming languages and medicine. The language is based around the idea that programs and humans have complementary strengths, that when combined can make for safer, more accurate performance of prescriptions. We implemented a prototype of our language and evaluated its design by writing prescriptions in the new language and administering a usability survey to medical professionals. This formative evaluation suggests that medical prescriptions can be conveyed by a programming language's mode of expression and provides useful information for refining the language. Analysis of the survey results suggests that medical professionals can understand and correctly modify programs in POP-PL.

Impulsive Personality Traits and Alcohol Use: Does Sleeping Help With Thinking?	PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Article						mandated college students; drinking; premeditation; sensation-seeking; urgency	DECISION-MAKING; WORKING-MEMORY; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; MEDIATING ROLE; EARLY-ONSET; DEPRIVATION; MODEL; RISK; CONSEQUENCES; BEHAVIOR	Both impulsivity and sleep disturbance have been associated with heavy alcohol use among young adults; yet studies to date have not examined their interactive effects. The current study aimed to determine if adequate sleep moderates the association between impulsive personality traits and alcohol use among young adults. College students (N = 568) who had been mandated to alcohol treatment following violation of campus alcohol policy provided information regarding alcohol use and related consequences, impulsive personality traits (measured using the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale), and perception of sleep adequacy as part of a larger intervention trial. Higher urgency, lower premeditation, and higher sensation-seeking predicted greater levels of alcohol consumption, while higher urgency predicted more alcohol-related consequences. As hypothesized, there was a significant interaction between premeditation and sleep adequacy in the prediction of drinks per week; in contrast to hypotheses, however, premeditation was associated with drinking only among those reporting adequate (rather than inadequate) sleep. Specifically, the tendency to premeditate was associated with less drinking among those who reported adequate sleep and was not associated with drinking among those reporting inadequate sleep. Sensation-seeking and urgency are associated with greater alcohol involvement among young adults, regardless of sleep adequacy. Conversely, the ability to plan ahead and anticipate the consequences of one's behaviors (premeditation) is only protective against heavy drinking among individuals receiving adequate sleep. With replication, these findings may inform alcohol prevention and intervention efforts.

Teacher dashboards also tend to emphasize features that support teachers using a "transition" or "direct instruction" model. In our approach, we iteratively designed, developed, tested, and refined a teacher dashboard that is linked to a student digital collaborative environment with an embedded problem-based mathematics curriculum. In this study, we investigate teacher dashboard features that support teacher enactment of problem-based mathematics curriculum embedded in a digital collaborative platform. We report on design principles that guided the development of three teacher dashboard features: (1) monitoring evidence of student thinking in real-time or after class, (2) accessing workspace for whole-class discussions of the problem, and (3) creating and sending "just-in-time" supports. The pedagogical advantages and challenges teachers face throughout the iterative development process are also discussed. Evidence from observational data and teacher interviews suggests that the organic synergism generated from the student and teacher digital platform offers several ways that teachers are provided with new and timely information from teacher dashboards that supports problem-based mathematics teaching.

Decision Aids for Advance Care Planning: An Overview of the State of the Science	ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Review							END; DIRECTIVES; LIFE; SUPPORT; CANCER; PREFERENCES; INFORMATION	Advance care planning honors patients' goals and preferences for future care by creating a plan for when illness or injury impedes the ability to think or communicate about health decisions. Fewer than 50% of severely or terminally ill patients have an advance directive in their medical record, and physicians are accurate only about 65% of the time when predicting patient preferences for intensive care. Decision aids can support the advance care planning process by providing a structured approach to informing patients about care options and prompting them to document and communicate their preferences. This review, commissioned as a technical brief by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Effective Health Care Program, provides a broad overview of current use of and research related to decision aids for adult advance care planning. Using interviews of key informants and a search of the gray and published literature from January 1990 to May 2014, the authors found that many decision aids are widely available but are not assessed in the empirical literature. The 16 published studies testing decision aids as interventions for adult advance care planning found that most are proprietary or not publicly available. Some are constructed for the general population, whereas others address disease-specific conditions that have more predictable end-of-life scenarios and, therefore, more discrete choices. New decision aids should be designed that are responsive to diverse philosophical perspectives and flexible enough to change as patients gain experience with their personal illness courses. Future efforts should include further research, training of advance care planning facilitators, dissemination and access, and tapping potential opportunities in social media or other technologies.

Search tactics used in solving everyday how-to technical tasks: Repertoire, selection and tenacity	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Tactics; Everyday life information seeking; How-to; Technical problem solving; Search success; Domain knowledge	INFORMATION-SEEKING; STRATEGIES; KNOWLEDGE; RELEVANCE; EXPERIENCE; COMPLEXITY; CRITERIA; CONTEXT; DOMAIN	With greater access to computational resources, people use search to address many everyday challenges in their lives, including solving technology problems. Although there are now many useful 'how-to' resources online (especially videos on YouTube), it can still be difficult to identify, understand, and resolve certain kinds of technical problem. While research tasks have been studied for many years and we know the tactics people use, we know far less about searchers' tactics for how-to technical tasks that involve actually being able to apply found information to resolve a problem. Crucial to our study was developing and studying a highly realistic, how-to technical task, for which there was no single guidance resource: making a phone safe for a child. After providing 39 participants with an actual phone to fix, and a search engine to perform the task, we analysed their search tactics using retrospective cued think aloud interviews. Our primary contribution is a set of 77 tactics used, in three categories, along with detail of how common they were. We conclude that people had a lot of tactics in their repertoire. Although it was not hard for participants to find relevant information, what was hard was for participants to find information they could use; indeed only 23% of participants successfully completed the entire task. Domain knowledge affected the choice of tactics used (although not necessarily towards better task success). We discuss these influences and make design recommendations for how future search systems can support those in resolving how-to technical tasks.

J	Sonetti, G; Naboni, E; Brown, M				Sonetti, Giulia; Naboni, Emanuele; Brown, Martin			Exploring the Potentials of ICT Tools for Human-Centric Regenerative Design	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						human-centric; artificial intelligence; ICT; regenerative sustainability	SUSTAINABLE BEHAVIOR; THERMAL COMFORT; SMART HOMES; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; QUALITY; INDOOR	Aiming for sustainable buildings and cities is critical to achieving a future that is socially just, ecologically regenerative, culturally rich, and economically viable. However, our current concepts of sustainability often exclude the essential domains of data, information, and the knowledge relating to the relationship between buildings and people that inhabit them. Thus, the research questions at the core of this paper have been as follows: Can technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) be used to create systems that enhance relationships between buildings and inhabitants? Can social networks and natural interactions support further research relating to human-centric design tools for the built environment? The Human Observation Meta-Environment (HOME) project was developed to address this question. The ICT architecture has been tested to observe and collect human behaviour data within a sentient room at the Politecnico di Torino (IT), where the inhabitants were strategically aware of their behaviours. Methods of analysis included technologies related to the domain of AI (such as Natural Language Analysis, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Deep Learning) that have been used in social network analysis in connection with the word 'comfort', and definitions resonate strongly with the realm of regenerative design. Results were used to further research the role of users that could serve as leverages to design (both spaces and related smart systems) according to actual user needs. People from very different disciplinary backgrounds interacted with the prototype in a workshop and provided stimuli for further considerations regarding the possible technological, psychological, cognitive, cultural, social, political, and aesthetical impacts of the use of these technologies inside sentient buildings. The paper enriches the discourse on how ICT data can be organised and read in a human-centric regenerative design process perspective.

Core to the RESTORE action are Working Groups, Training Schools and Short Term Scientific Missions exploring the spectrum of regenerative sustainability state-of-the-art practice and future visions. COST is the longest-running European framework supporting trans-national cooperation among researchers, engineers and scholars across Europe. It is a unique means for them to jointly develop their own ideas and new initiatives across all fields in science and technology, including social sciences and humanities, through pan-European networking of nationally funded research activities. Based on a European intergovernmental framework for cooperation in science and technology, COST has been contributing-since its creation in 1971-to closing the gap between science, policy makers and society throughout Europe and beyond. As a precursor of advanced multidisciplinary research, COST plays a very important role in building a European Research Area ( ERA) http://www.cost.eu. The HOME project was created by the convergence of several research institutes: Human Ecosystems Relations ( HER) (Salvatore Iaconesi and Oriana Persico), the Inter-Department of Science, Territorial Projects and Policies (DIST) with the PoliTo Green Team (Giulia Sonetti), and the UniTo Green Office (Dario Cottafava). The researchwas funded by the Siebel Energy Institute grant for the URBE project 'Understanding the Relationship Between Urban Form and Energy Consumption Through Behavioural Patterns', coordinated by Patrizia Lombardi, Politecnico di Torino (http://www.siebelenergyinstitute.org/2016-research-grants/).

In the online arena specifically, the tools available for course construction exacerbate this problem by making it difficult to build the types of active learning activities that research shows to be the most effective. Here, we present a report on Habitable Worlds, offered by Arizona State University for 12 semesters over the past 6 years. This is a unique online course that uses an array of novel technologies to deliver an active, inquiry-driven learning experience. Learning outcomes and quantitative data from more than 3000 students demonstrate the success of our approach but also identify several remaining challenges. The design and development of this course offers valuable lessons for instructional designers and educators who are interested in fully capitalizing on the capabilities of 21(st)-century technology to achieve educational goals.

The PSL literature has so far suggested that value propositions are central to the value creation process, but there is scant understanding of how value propositions are created and adapted to citizens' needs. The paper contributes by showing how the creation and alteration of value propositions takes place through framing and reframing processes, and it explores how the concept of framing can further advance PSL.

PBL was examined in dietetics education through random assignment of 32 undergraduate dietetics students for two weeks to either a problem-based or a lecture-based case format for the infant and elderly units of a 16-week lifespan nutrition course. Random assignment followed stratification for gender and earlier course examination performance. Expert validation of PBL curricular components and noted differences in discussion structure and information resources verified curriculum distinctiveness. Main outcome measures were pre and post-Cognitive Behavior Survey scores for memorization, reflection, and positive learning experience scales, unit and course evaluations and unit examination scores. Students in problem-based modules demonstrated greater gains in reflective thinking with stable memorization, suggesting improved critical thinking skills. Tenets that problem-based learning promotes knowledge retention and provides a more positive learning experience were not upheld. Knowledge acquisition was not hindered by a problem-based approach. We conclude that gains in reflective thinking and evidence of increased self-directed learning argue for inclusion of PBL in dietetics curricula and that a problem-based education will help dietitians successfully respond to professional development needs.

These are settings where one does not usually think of market solutions. Core theory has established that price-taking behaviour by both suppliers and consumers, i.e. the absence of strategic considerations, greatly improves the informational value of prices, and hence of economic equilibria. This also holds when using market-like institutions to allocate resources for public goods. Policy effectiveness in many areas can be improved when agents are induced to reveal, voluntarily and truthfully, their willingness-to-pay or production costs.

In such evaluation tasks, humans excel at making mental connections among diverse knowledge sets to score ideas on their uniqueness. However, their decisions about novelty are often subjective and difficult to explain. In this paper, we demonstrate a way to uncover human judgment of design idea similarity using two-dimensional (2D) idea maps. We derive these maps by asking participants for simple similarity comparisons of the form "Is idea A more similar to idea B or to idea C?" We show that these maps give insight into the relationships between ideas and help understand the design domain. We also propose that novel ideas can be identified by finding outliers on these idea maps. To demonstrate our method, we conduct experimental evaluations on two datasets-colored polygons (known answer) and milk frother sketches (unknown answer). We show that idea maps shed light on factors considered by participants in judging idea similarity and the maps are robust to noisy ratings. We also compare physical maps made by participants on a white-board to their computationally generated idea maps to compare how people think about spatial arrangement of design items. This method provides a new direction of research into deriving ground truth novelty metrics by combining human judgments and computational methods.

Acoustic identification of Mexican bats based on taxonomic and ecological constraints on call design	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						acoustic identification; guild; hierarchical classification; machine learning; Neotropical; random forest; whispering bats	ECHOLOCATION CALLS; CLASSIFICATION; CHIROPTERA; HABITAT; GUILD	Monitoring global biodiversity is critical for understanding responses to anthropogenic change, but biodiversity monitoring is often biased away from tropical, megadiverse areas that are experiencing more rapid environmental change. Acoustic surveys are increasingly used to monitor biodiversity change, especially for bats as they are important indicator species and most use sound to detect, localise and classify objects. However, using bat acoustic surveys for monitoring poses several challenges, particularly in megadiverse regions. Many species lack reference recordings, some species have high call similarity or differ in call detectability, and quantitative classification tools, such as machine learning algorithms, have rarely been applied to data from these areas. Here, we collate a reference call library for bat species that occur in a megadiverse country, Mexico. We use 4685 search-phase calls from 1378 individual sequences of 59 bat species to create automatic species identification tools generated by machine learning algorithms (Random Forest). We evaluate the improvement in species-level classification rates gained by using hierarchical classifications, reflecting either taxonomic or ecological constraints (guilds) on call design, and examine how classification rate accuracy changes at different hierarchical levels (family, genus and guild). Species-level classification of calls had a mean accuracy of 66%, and the use of hierarchies improved mean species-level classification accuracy by up to 6% (species within families 72%, species within genera 712% and species within guilds 691%). Classification accuracy to family, genus and guild-level was 917%, 778% and 825%, respectively. The bioacoustic identification tools we have developed are accurate for rapid biodiversity assessments in a megadiverse region and can also be used effectively to classify species at broader taxonomic or ecological levels. This flexibility increases their usefulness when there are incomplete species reference recordings and also offers the opportunity to characterise and track changes in bat community structure. Our results show that bat bioacoustic surveys in megadiverse countries have more potential than previously thought to monitor biodiversity changes and can be used to direct further developments of bioacoustic monitoring programs in Mexico.

The discovery of hidden process data's knowledge assets may help to digitalize processes. Working on a valuable knowledge asset discovery process, we found a major challenge in that organizational data and knowledge are likely to be unstructured and undigitized, constraining the power of today's process mining methodologies (PMM). Whereas it has been proved in digitally mature companies, the scope of PMM becomes wider with the complement proposed in this paper, embracing organizations in the process of improving their digital maturity based on available data. We propose the C4PM method, which integrates agile principles, systems thinking and natural language processing techniques to analyze the behavioral patterns of organizational semi-structured or unstructured data from a holistic perspective to discover valuable hidden information and uncover the related knowledge assets aligned with the organization strategic or business goals. Those assets are the key to pointing out potential processes susceptible to be handled using PMM, empowering a sustainable organizational digital transformation. A case study analysis from a dataset containing information on employees' emails in a multinational company was conducted.

This application of the Modulor has already been referred to in other works, yet its extent and meaning have never been investigated in depth. The assessment of the application of the Modulor in the Pousada will be supported by a review of the known sketches and technical drawings, which are kept in the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation's Art Library in Lisbon, and by the dimensional survey carried out on the building. The understanding of this application will be framed in the context of an assessment of the importance of geometry in the design thought of Manual Tainha, who was one of the protagonists of the revision of the Modern Movement in Portuguese architecture of the 1950s.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						economic evaluation; prioritization; public health	CLINICAL PREVENTIVE SERVICES	Background: Debates surrounding the use of conventional approaches in public health and the existence of perceived barriers to using the results of economic evaluations have led to questions posed as to how to establish priorities within public health schemes. The aims of this study were therefore to explore the feasibility and validity of economic evaluation techniques in developing priorities within public health programmes and consider the extent to which different presentational approaches are likely to be incorporated into decision-making, from perspectives of relevant stakeholders. Methods: An advisory board, representative of potential users of economic evaluations, was set up to identify preferences for how findings from economic evaluations might be presented to decision makers and to test the impact of different approaches, different outputs and different presentational styles. The board was divided into two groups, each of which was given three hypothetical 'scenarios' to consider. The scenarios comprised descriptions of methods and outputs, with costs, effects, target population and context of intervention constant across all scenarios. Results: The perceived validity of estimates of effectiveness was vitally important, along with sufficient information to gauge whether designs were appropriate and to assess implementation practicalities. Cost-benefit analysis and cost-utility analysis were the preferred approaches despite their complexity, although participants required benchmarks to place net-benefit estimates from cost-benefit analyses into context. Conclusion: Further research is required to substantiate and build on these preliminary findings and collaborations between economists and policy makers are needed to develop clear, rigorous and standard guidance relating to economic evaluation, recognizing the diversity of public health strategies.

TPS1 drug design for rice blast disease in magnaporthe oryzae	SPRINGERPLUS			English	Article						M. oryzae; Rice blast disease; Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase 1; Tps1; Fungus; Molecular dynamics simulation	THERMUS-THERMOPHILUS RQ-1; TREHALOSE-6-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE; TREHALOSE SYNTHESIS; PLANT INFECTION; PROTEIN; METABOLISM; PATHWAY; TOOL	Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) is a fungal pathogen and the causal agent of rice blast disease. Previous lipidomics analysis of M. oryzae demonstrated that trehalose, a carbohydrate common to various fungi and algae, is thought to be involved in the possible conversion of glycogen into triacylglycerides for energy, an important step in the pathogenesis of M. oryzae. A key enzyme responsible for trehalose synthesis is trehalose-6-phosphate synthase 1 (Tps1). Therefore, we modeled the structure of Tps1 and sought to screen a chemical database in silico for possible inhibitors of the enzyme. Based on homologous alignment and sequence analysis, we first modeled the structure of Tps1 to determine the potential active site of the enzyme and its conformation. Using this model, we then undertook a docking study to determine the potential interaction that would manifest between Tsp1 and potential chemical inhibitors. Of the 400,000 chemicals screened in the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository, we identified 45 potential candidates. The best candidate (Compound 24789937) was chosen and subjected to various structural optimization techniques to improve the suitability of the potential chemical inhibitors at the docking site of Tps1. From these modified versions of Compound 24789937, one lead compound (Lead 25) was shown to have the best binding affinity to Tps1 and good water solubility as compared with the ideal template compound and the other 44 potential candidates. Molecular dynamics simulation further confirmed the strength of the Tps1-Lead 25 complex and indicated the potential for Lead 25 to be used as an inhibitor of Tps1 in the control of M. oryzae-mediated rice blast disease.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a philosophical framework for analyzing examples of self-documentation on the dimensions of ontology, epistemology and ethics. Design/methodology/approach - The framework addresses these three major areas of philosophic thought by operationalizing insights from philosophy, chiefly the work of Martin Heidegger. Heidegger's concepts of authenticity and fallenness inform the poles of each dimension of the framework. Findings - Ontologically, self-documentation may manifest as document (authentic) or data (fallen); epistemologically, as understanding (authentic) or idle curiosity (fallen); and ethically, as self-care (authentic) or diversion (fallen). These dimensions are presented separately but are understood to be intermingled. Originality/value - This unified framework offers a lens for examining and comparing cases of self-documentation and self-documents. No such framework has previously been articulated, but given the ubiquity and growing importance of self-documentation, it is needed.

J	Stevens, M; Brimblecombe, N; Bou, C; Wittenberg, R				Stevens, Madeleine; Brimblecombe, Nicola; Bou, Camille; Wittenberg, Raphael			Thinking about caring for older relatives in the future: a qualitative exploration	AGEING & SOCIETY			English	Article; Early Access						unpaid care; informal care; attitudes to caring; willingness to care; older people	INFORMAL CARE; PEOPLE	The number of dependent older people in England, as elsewhere, is projected to rise substantially, while the number of unpaid carers is not projected to rise by an equivalent amount. Barriers to people caring for older relatives have been theorised, however, there is a lack of understanding of attitudes to providing care in the future among people who are not currently carers. This paper presents qualitative analysis of interviews with 20 people in middle age about their willingness to care for older relatives in the future. Interviewees were asked their general views about who should provide care, then to consider future scenarios in which a close relative developed care needs. Willingness to care was influenced by beliefs about reciprocity, love and identity, beliefs about who was likely to provide the best quality and most appropriate care, and beliefs about how difficult caring would be. Older relatives' care preferences were a key consideration. While some interviewees felt the best care would always be provided by family, others considered that professional skills were needed. Interviewees saw important roles for easily accessible information and advice, sharing care, including respite care, and financial support, in making it easier to provide care. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown had highlighted relevant issues for interviewees, which are discussed.

The proposed method merges the criteria of availability, accessibility, attractiveness, usability, and suitability in a multi-level approach (city, neighborhood green area) to assist in the selection of which services within green areas to enhance from those requested by citizens. The case study is an urban park in a medium-sized Italian city (Perugia). The results demonstrate that the available urban green spaces amount to 34.7 m(2) per person, but only 24% of citizens have adequate access to a green area providing at least an adequate level of service, and 18% of them are without access to any appropriately equipped green area. Furthermore, citizens have limited knowledge of their city's urban green system as a whole. Indeed, 41% of the requested services were already available in other accessible green areas with attractive and readily available dedicated equipment. These areas were suggested as alternative solutions. To achieve a complex systems approach, our results suggest observing similar systems with various and adaptable scales and studying them as open networks composed of heterogeneous internal and external variables.

J	Khelifa, R; Mahdjoub, H				Khelifa, Rassim; Mahdjoub, Hayat			EcoDragons: A Game for Environmental Education and Public Outreach	INSECTS			English	Article						dragonfly; ecology; conservation; community science; pedagogy	ODONATA; DRAGONFLIES; ECOLOGY	Simple Summary We face serious ecological and societal issues that require a rethinking of our approaches to involving the public in problem-solving and decision-making. Researchers need help from community scientists to gather data and generate fruitful discussions to tackle planetary problems. However, the establishment and maintenance of strong links between scientists and society require innovative ways of communication outside conventional educational institutions. Here, we propose a game that teaches the players the basics of ecological thinking when approaching environmental issues and biodiversity conservation. The game is called EcoDragons and it uses dragonflies as the main biological entity to colonize, establish and maintain biodiversity in an empty landscape that regularly faces climatic and anthropogenic disturbances. While the current EcoDragons was based on European dragonflies, the concept is highly adaptable to dragonflies of other regions (changing the species names), or even to other taxonomic groups. Besides the various pedagogical benefits, the game has the potential to foster public engagement in biodiversity conservation and community science. Environmental education is crucial to tackling the pressing ecological and societal issues on our planet. Although there are various ways to approach environmental education and raise public awareness, games are potentially an effective vehicle of knowledge and engagement because they vulgarize the scientific information in a universal 'language' and bring people together. Here, we designed a game, EcoDragons, that integrates principles of ecology, biological conservation, life history, and taxonomy. The protagonists of the game are dragonflies and damselflies. The aim of the game is to colonize habitats with different species and use ecological processes (e.g., predation, competition, and mutualism) and conservation measures (e.g., restoration and reintroduction) to face random environmental disturbances (e.g., climate warming, drought, pollution, and biological invasion). The version of the game presented in this paper was based on European species. The game includes 50 species (25 dragonflies and 25 damselflies). The winner of the game is the one who occupies more habitats, establishes and maintains the largest number of species, and solves more anthropogenic disturbances. EcoDragons has a global outreach potential to educate the public about ecology, conservation, and organismic life history, and will probably engage people in environmental advocacy.

Furthermore, construction quality information is still recorded on paper, with the risk of document loss and data manipulation, jeopardizing quality accountability. Blockchain has attracted increasing attention from the construction industry because it can record information in an immutable and transparent way and automate some businesses with smart contracts. These properties can tackle information fraud and improve the automation level of OCQI. Unfortunately, very few documented blockchain solutions for OCQI exist. To fill the theoretical knowledge gap, the design thinking approach was adopted to present a blockchain-based conceptual framework. The consortium network and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) were selected as the suitable blockchain type and development platform for OCQI. The consensus process in HLF and smart contracts-based compliance checking are illustrated. Moreover, the benefits of integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) and ontology technology with blockchain are analyzed in detail, which can facilitate the coevaluation of these three technologies. Finally, a prototype system was developed to vividly show the theoretical feasibility. The proposed blockchain solution can be fine-tuned and evaluated in future research. Challenges hindering the practical implementation of blockchains are systematically discussed within the technology-organization-environment (TOE) theory, which can be reused in future investigations to identify construction stakeholders' concerns on adopting blockchains.

J	Liu, HC				Liu, Han-Chin			Investigating the Impact of Cognitive Style on Multimedia Learners' Understanding and Visual Search Patterns: An Eye-Tracking Approach	JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING RESEARCH			English	Article						multimedia learning; eye tracking; cognitive style; information processing	PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY	Multimedia students' dependence on information from the outside world can have an impact on their ability to identify and locate information from multiple resources in learning environments and thereby affect the construction of mental models. Field dependence-independence has been used to assess the ability to extract essential information from the environment. This study utilized eye-tracking technology to explore whether field-dependent and field-independent (FI) learners differed in their visual searching efficiency and multimedia learning performance. The FI learners outperformed field-dependent learners in posttest indices. In addition, FI learners were better able to identify visual cues and demonstrated efficient visual search patterns when learning using different information formats. The research findings echoed previous findings: The dependence on information in the context of learning can affect learners' visual search efficiency and learning performance. The findings of this study suggest that adaptable learning environments that provide a rich variety of media may benefit learners with different levels of information-dependence. Applying eye-tracking technology enabled blueprints to be created pertaining to the learners' information processing. However, additional research techniques, such as think-aloud exercises, would enable deeper understanding of how learners construct mental models of a knowledge base in a multimedia learning environment.

The phases within consist of designing a set of workshops with a gender approach, making use of Arduino, as it allows for introducing concepts in electronics and programming. For this, a mixed research method was applied, where quantitative and qualitative information was collected. The study was carried out with teachers from Latin American schools, where teachers from Chile and Colombia participated the most, and was conducted in virtual mode through the Zoom platform. As a result, it was found that Arduino and its components can be used to build projects that can be related in a real context, which further motivates students. It was also found that the levels of creativity, attitude, and motivation of the students increased with the workshops that were carried out.

The ScriptsMap framework aims to provide a means of articulating and combining activities (which a script specifies) from two or more methods so that a facilitator or group facilitation team can construct, with the framework's aid, a thoughtful and careful design for a workshop. To provide an example of the framework, the combination of system dynamics group model building and group problem structuring incorporating causal mapping with the use of a Group Support System is used. The paper will illustrate ScriptsMap's structure through an example of the use of the framework in practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Design; Human Factors; Languages; Empirical study; open source; opportunistic development; search archetypes	OF-THE-LITERATURE; INFORMATION-SCIENCE; SOFTWARE; FRAMEWORK; RELEVANCE; THINKING; PROGRAM; NOTION	Software developers search the Web for various kinds of source code for diverse reasons. In a previous study, we found that searches varied along two dimensions: the size of the search target (e. g., block, subsystem, or system) and the motivation for the search (e. g., reference example or as-is reuse). Would each of these kinds of searches require different search technologies? To answer this question, we conducted an experiment with 36 participants to evaluate three diverse approaches (general purpose information retrieval, source code search, and component reuse), as represented by five Web sites (Google, Koders, Krugle, Google Code Search, and SourceForge). The independent variables were search engine, size of search target, and motivation for search. The dependent variable was the participants judgement of the relevance of the first ten hits. We found that it was easier to find reference examples than components for as-is reuse and that participants obtained the best results using a general-purpose information retrieval site. However, we also found an interaction effect: code-specific search engines worked better in searches for subsystems, but Google worked better on searches for blocks. These results can be used to guide the creation of new tools for retrieving source code from the Web.

Our experience with this exercise demonstrates that the bradycardia associated with the diving response is a robust effect that can easily be measured by students without any sophisticated measurement technology. We discuss measures that maximize the success of the exercise by reducing individual variation, designing experiments that are minimally affected by change in the response over time, collecting data in appropriate time increments, and applying the most powerful statistical analysis. Emphasis is placed on pedagogical opportunities for using this exercise to teach general principles of physiology, experimental design, and data analysis. Data collected by students, background information for instructors, a discussion of the relevance of the diving reflex to humans, suggestions for additional experiments, and thought questions with sample answers are included.

The sediment-laden water problem is causing serious impacts on river ecosystems not only in South Korea but also in most countries. The vegetative filter strip (VFS) has been thought to be one of the most effective methods to reduce the transport of sediment to down-gradient area. However, the effective width of the VFS first needs to be determined before VFS installation in the field. To provide an easy-to-use interface with a scientific VFS modeling engine, the Web GIS-based VFSMOD system was developed in this study. The Web GIS-based VFSMOD uses the UH and VFSM executable programs from the VFSMOD-w model as core engines to simulate rainfall-runoff and sediment trapping. To provide soil information for a point of interest, the Google Map interface to the MapServer soil database system was developed using the Google Map API, Javascript, Perl/CGI, and Oracle DB programming. Three modules of the Web GIS-based VFSMOD system were developed for various VFS designs under single storm, multiple storm, and long-term period scenarios. These modules in the Web GIS-based VFSMOD system were applied to the study watershed in South Korea and these were proven as efficient tools for the VFS design for various purposes.

A qualitative phenomenology design was used in the study. Data was collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews comprising ten guiding questions. Three pre-service physics and three pre-service chemistry teachers participated conveniently in the study. While the pre-service chemistry teachers took a course regarding the CI explicitly taught, the pre-service physics teachers were not subjected to any information relating to the CI in their course. Data was analyzed by forming the codes and themes. Generally speaking, while the pre-service chemistry teachers think that physics concepts should be used in the chemistry lessons, the preservice physics teachers believe that these two subjects' concepts generally are not related to each other. Moreover, the participants had some difficulties in understanding the CI between physics and chemistry concepts. The possible implication for science teacher education and research is discussed.

A meta-analysis on model-based social learning	PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW			English	Review						Biased social learning; Decision making; Model-based social learning; Social information use; Social learning strategies	ZEBRA FINCHES; CULTURAL TRANSMISSION; FOOD PREFERENCES; COPYING BEHAVIOR; DEMONSTRATOR AGE; INFORMATION; FAMILIARITY; ATTENTION; SELECTION; KINSHIP	Social learning via the observation of or interaction with other individuals can allow animals to obtain information about the local environment. Once social information is obtained, animals may or may not act on and use this information. Animals may learn from others selectively based on particular characteristics (e.g., familiarity, age, dominance) of the information provider, which is thought to maximize the benefits of social learning. Biases to copy certain individuals over others plays an important role in how information is transmitted and used among individuals, and can influence the emergence of group-level behaviors (i.e., traditions). Two underlying factors can affect from whom animals learn: the population social dynamics - with whom you associate (e.g., familiar), and status of the demonstrator (e.g., dominant). We systematically surveyed the literature and conducted a meta-analysis to test whether demonstrator characteristics consistently influence social learning, and if social dynamics strategies differ from status strategies in their influence on social learning. We extracted effect sizes from papers that used an observer-demonstrator paradigm to test if the characteristics of the individual providing social information (i.e., the demonstrator) influence social information use by observers. We obtained 139 effect sizes on 33 species from 54 experiments. First, we found an effect of experimental design on the influence of demonstrator characteristics on social learning: between-subject designs had stronger effects compared to within-subject designs. Second, we found that demonstrator characteristics do indeed influence social learning. Characteristics based on social dynamics and characteristics based on status had a significant effect on social learning, especially when copying familiar and kin demonstrators. These results highlight the role that demonstrator characteristics play on social learning, which can have implications for the formation and establishment of behavioural traditions in animals.

It is important to assess student thinking in this conceptual area, because it is a fundamental requirement of being statistically literate and associated skills are needed in almost all walks of life. Despite this, previous work shows that non-expert-like thinking in statistical reasoning is common, even after instruction. As science educators, our goal should be to move students along a novice-to-expert spectrum, which could be achieved with growing experience in statistical reasoning. We used item response theory analyses (the one-parameter Rasch model and associated analyses) to assess responses gathered from biology students in two populations at a large research university in Canada in order to test SRBCI's robustness and sensitivity in capturing useful data relating to the students' conceptual ability in statistical reasoning. Our analyses indicated that SRBCI is a unidimensional construct, with items that vary widely in difficulty and provide useful information about such student ability. SRBCI should be useful as a diagnostic tool in a variety of biology settings and as a means of measuring the success of teaching interventions designed to improve statistical reasoning skills.

When we think of mobility in social or cultural terms, a different set of topics come into view: pilgrimage and religious practice, globalization and economic disparities, migration and cultural identity, daily commutes and the suburbanization of cities. In this paper, we examine the links between these two aspects of mobility. Drawing oil non-technological examples Of cultural encounters with space, we argue that mobile information technologies do not just operate in space, but they are tools that serve to structure the spaces through Which they move. We use recent projects to illustrate how three concerns with mobility and space-legibility, literacy, and legitimacy-open up new avenues for design exploration and analysis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Qualitative Assessment of Perioperative Lactation Patient Education: "I Think It&apos;s Something Women Navigate on Their Own"	BREASTFEEDING MEDICINE			English	Article						perioperative lactation; qualitative assessment; patient education; anesthesia; sedation		Background: Patients who are lactating at the time of a procedure requiring anesthesia benefit from specific education and care coordination to support continued lactation and avoid complications. Before design and implementation of a comprehensive care pathway for this patient population at our institution, we sought to elicit the patient perspective.Methods: We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with eight patients by phone regarding their experience as a lactating patient presenting for a procedure with anesthesia care at our institution. These were analyzed for predominant themes regarding their experiences.Results: The patients we interviewed reported receiving conflicting information and feeling a sense of uncertainty. Some patients experienced preventable health effects such as mastitis, and prior experience with breastfeeding was protective. The interviewed patients endorsed a desire for structured support and improved education resources.Discussion: This qualitative study of lactating patients undergoing anesthesia and surgery demonstrates a need for coordinated perioperative lactation care.

Start Position Strongly Influences Fixation Patterns during Face Processing: Difficulties with Eye Movements as a Measure of Information Use	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PERCEPTION; RECOGNITION; EXPLORATION; FAMILIARITY; ASYMMETRIES; INVERSION; STIMULUS; REVEAL; SPAN; TASK	Fixation patterns are thought to reflect cognitive processing and, thus, index the most informative stimulus features for task performance. During face recognition, initial fixations to the center of the nose have been taken to indicate this location is optimal for information extraction. However, the use of fixations as a marker for information use rests on the assumption that fixation patterns are predominantly determined by stimulus and task, despite the fact that fixations are also influenced by visuo-motor factors. Here, we tested the effect of starting position on fixation patterns during a face recognition task with upright and inverted faces. While we observed differences in fixations between upright and inverted faces, likely reflecting differences in cognitive processing, there was also a strong effect of start position. Over the first five saccades, fixation patterns across start positions were only coarsely similar, with most fixations around the eyes. Importantly, however, the precise fixation pattern was highly dependent on start position with a strong tendency toward facial features furthest from the start position. For example, the often-reported tendency toward the left over right eye was reversed for the left starting position. Further, delayed initial saccades for central versus peripheral start positions suggest greater information processing prior to the initial saccade, highlighting the experimental bias introduced by the commonly used center start position. Finally, the precise effect of face inversion on fixation patterns was also dependent on start position. These results demonstrate the importance of a non-stimulus, non-task factor in determining fixation patterns. The patterns observed likely reflect a complex combination of visuo-motor effects and simple sampling strategies as well as cognitive factors. These different factors are very difficult to tease apart and therefore great caution must be applied when interpreting absolute fixation locations as indicative of information use, particularly at a fine spatial scale.

Design Controversial ProtecT (prostate testing for cancer and treatment), trial embedded within qualitative research. Background and setting Screening for prostate cancer is hotly debated, and evidence from trials about the effectiveness of treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, and monitoring) is lacking. Mounting a treatment trial is controversial because of past failures and concerns that differences in complications of treatment but not survival make randomisation unacceptable to patients and clinicians, particularly for a trial including monitoring. Strategy for change In-depth interviews explored interpretation of study information. Audiotape recordings of recruitment appointments enabled scrutiny of content and presentation of study information by recruiters. Initial qualitative findings showed that recruiters had difficulty discussing equipoise and presenting treatments equally; they unknowingly used terminology that was misinterpreted by participants. Findings were used to determine changes to content and presentation of information. Effects of change Changes to the order of presenting treatments encouraged emphasis on equivalence, misinterpreted terms were avoided, the non-radical arm was redefined, and randomisation and clinical equipoise were presented more convincingly. The randomisation rate increased from 40% to 70%, all treatments became acceptable, and the three arm trial became the preferred design. Lessons learnt Changes to information and presentation resulted in efficient recruitment acceptable to patients and clinicians. Embedding this controversial trial within qualitative research improved recruitment. Such methods probably have wider applicability and may enable even the most difficult evaluative questions to be tackled.

Subjects completed questionnaires after viewing short videos that contained different message types and social media metrics, and a final sample of 295 cases was included in the data analysis. The study found that, while the type of information (i.e., non-narrative or narrative) of the low-carbon-themed social media short videos had no direct effect on people's willingness to protect the environment, its indirect effects were significant. These indirect effects were achieved through immersion experience and social influence. Subjects who watched narrative videos had a higher level of immersion experience, which in turn was significantly and positively correlated with environmental intention; meanwhile, those who watched non-narrative videos experienced a higher level of social influence, which in turn was significantly and positively correlated with environmental intention. In addition, subjects who viewed high-volume videos experienced a more positive effect on their willingness to protect the environment. This study explored how message design could promote subjects' perceptions and positive attitudes towards environmental protection, with important managerial implications.

Method Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions: a control condition (no training); a passive inoculation condition; or an active inoculation condition. Participants completed demographic questions followed by training or no training and then evaluated a misinformation and factual article for reliability and persuasiveness. Results Participants in the active inoculation condition rated the reliability and persuasiveness of the misinformation article and the reliability of the factual article lower than participants in the control condition. Participants in the passive inoculation training did not rate the reliability and persuasiveness of a misinformation and factual article significantly differently to those in the control condition. When factors such as ideological worldview and climate change beliefs were controlled for however, the inoculation interventions had no significant effect on ratings of reliability and persuasiveness for a misinformation or factual article. Conclusion Inoculation seems to be a promising method of preventing the acceptance of misinformation on climate science. However, this analysis highlights that more investigation is required in order to determine the most effective inoculation training design.

Advanced analytics are becoming increasingly critical in making strategic decisions in any organization from the private to public sectors and from for-profit companies to not-for-profit organizations. Despite the growing importance of capturing, sharing and implementing people's knowledge in organizations, it is still unclear how big data and the need for advanced analytics can inform and, if necessary, reform the design and implementation of KM systems. Design/methodology/approach - To address this gap, a combined approach has been applied. The KM and data analysis systems implemented by companies were analyzed, and the analysis was complemented by a review of the extant literature. Findings - Four types of data-based decisions and a set of ground rules are identified toward enabling KM systems to handle big data and advanced analytics. Practical implications - The paper proposes a practical framework that takes into account the diverse combinations of data-based decisions. Suggestions are provided about how KM systems can be reformed to facilitate the incorporation of big data and advanced analytics into organizations' strategic decision-making. Originality/value - This is the first typology of data-based decision-making considering advanced analytics.

J	Hannaford, P				Hannaford, P			The collection and interpretation of epidemiological data about the cardiovascular risks associated with the use of steroid contraceptives	CONTRACEPTION			English	Article						steroid contraceptives; safety; risk; cardiovascular disease; epidemiological study design	ORAL-CONTRACEPTIVES; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; PROGESTIN POTENCY; BREAST-CANCER; DISEASE; AGE; CHOLESTEROL; SELECTION; ESTROGEN	A variety of epidemiological approaches have been used to assess the safety of steroid contraceptives. Each study design has its own strengths and weaknesses, especially with respect to susceptibility to bias and confounding. Randomized controlled trials provide the strongest evidence of a cause and effect relationship, but the low incidence of cardiovascular disease in women of reproductive age precludes the use of this study design to examine these clinical endpoints. Consequently, observational cohort and case-control studies have provided the most useful clinical information about the main cardiovascular effects of steroid contraceptives. Data from epidemiological research need to be interpreted carefully taking into consideration which of the potential biases or sources of confounding are likely to have affected a particular study, and what effect these may have on any inferences from the study. Additional factors that need to be considered before deciding whether a causal relationship exists include evidence that the exposure preceded the disease, the strength of association, consistency of findings with other studies, presence of dose gradients, and agreement with animal or laboratory research. Even if a causal link is thought to be plausible, the public health implications may be minimal; absolute (attributable) risks are required in order to assess these, An understanding of these epidemiological issues will enable clinicians to advise their clients whether steroid contraceptives alter the risk of cardiovascular disease and, if so, the clinical significance of such changes.

We hypothesize that one reason may be lack of effective support for helping end-user programmers problem-solve their own way around barriers they encounter. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the Idea Garden, a concept designed to help end-user programmers generate new ideas and problem-solve when they run into barriers. The Idea Garden has its roots in Minimalist Learning Theory and problem-solving theories. Our proof-of-concept prototype of the Idea Garden concept in the CoScripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature. It does so using an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving strategies, for design patterns and for programming concepts. Our empirical results showed that this approach helped end-user programmers overcome all three types of barriers that our prototype targeted.

J	Gatenby, RA; Frieden, BR				Gatenby, Robert A.; Frieden, B. Roy			Coulomb Interactions between Cytoplasmic Electric Fields and Phosphorylated Messenger Proteins Optimize Information Flow in Cells	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DYNAMICS; MEMBRANE	Background: Normal membrane (CM) to the nucleus. Movement of messenger proteins in the cytoplasm is thought to be dependent on random walk. However, Brownian motion will disperse messenger proteins throughout the cytosol resulting in slow and highly variable transit times. We propose that a critical component of information transfer is an intracellular electric field generated by distribution of charge on the nuclear membrane (NM). While the latter has been demonstrated experimentally for decades, the role of the consequent electric field has been assumed to be minimal due to a Debye length of about 1 nanometer that results from screening by intracellular Cl- and K+. We propose inclusion of these inorganic ions in the Debye-Huckel equation is incorrect because nuclear pores allow transit through the membrane at a rate far faster than the time to thermodynamic equilibrium. In our model, only the charged, mobile messenger proteins contribute to the Debye length. Findings: Using this revised model and published data, we estimate the NM possesses a Debye-Huckel length of a few microns and find this is consistent with recent measurement using intracellular nano-voltmeters. We demonstrate the field will accelerate isolated messenger proteins toward the nucleus through Coulomb interactions with negative charges added by phosphorylation. We calculate transit times as short as 0.01 sec. When large numbers of phosphorylated messenger proteins are generated by increasing concentrations of extracellular ligands, we demonstrate they generate a self-screening environment that regionally attenuates the cytoplasmic field, slowing movement but permitting greater cross talk among pathways. Preliminary experimental results with phosphorylated RAF are consistent with model predictions. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that previously unrecognized Coulomb interactions between phosphorylated messenger proteins and intracellular electric fields will optimize information transfer from the CM to the NM in cells.

Convergence across Tactile Afferent Types in Primary and Secondary Somatosensory Cortices	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VIBROTACTILE STIMULATION; AREA-II; NEURONS; ORGANIZATION; CORTEX; INFORMATION; MONKEYS; FLUTTER; FIBERS; CATS	Integration of information by convergence of inputs onto sensory cortical neurons is a requisite for processing higher-order stimulus features. Convergence across defined peripheral input classes has generally been thought to occur at levels beyond the primary sensory cortex, however recent work has shown that this does not hold for the convergence of slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting inputs in primary somatosensory cortex. We have used a new analysis method for multi-unit recordings, to show convergence of inputs deriving from the rapidly-adapting and Pacinian channels in a proportion of neurons in both primary and secondary somatosensory cortex in the anaesthetised cat. We have validated this method using single-unit recordings. The secondary somatosensory cortex has a greater proportion of sites that show convergence of this type than primary somatosensory cortex. These findings support the hypothesis that the more complex features processed in higher cortical areas require a greater degree of convergence across input classes, but also shows that this convergence is apparent in the primary somatosensory cortex.

J	McGregor, D; Frodsham, S; Deller, C				McGregor, Debra; Frodsham, Sarah; Deller, Clarysly			Participatory Inquiries That Promote Consideration of Socio-Scientific Issues Related to Sustainability within Three Different Contexts: Agriculture, Botany and Palaeontology	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						scientific citizenship; sustainability across contexts; dramatised inquiries	SCIENCE-EDUCATION	The involvement of students in dramatised inquiries, through participatory activity, offers opportunities to act in-role as scientists. The inquiries can 'set-the-scene', provide context and challenges for students to consider possibilities within and beyond everyday life. This approach can engage students in thinking about sustainability and developing citizenship competencies, such as thinking scientifically and critiquing ideas, interrogating evidence and assessing the validity of information, as well as decision making and problem solving. In this paper, adopting stories from the history of science is shown to provide rich, authentic contexts that engage students imaginatively and collaboratively in addressing past, present and future socio-scientific issues. To demonstrate how the approach can be adapted we drew on the work of three scientists: an agriculturalist; a botanist and a palaeontologist. Their scientific work informed the learning activities of several primary science lessons (with students aged 9-10). The agricultural activities were informed by the work of George Washington Carver and were related to improving soil quality through crop rotation as well as thinking about the diversity of food and other products that can be produced from plants. The botanically informed activities promoted understanding about processes linked to maintaining species diversity. These drew on the work of Marianne North, a Victorian botanical artist, noted for her detailed plant observations. The final socio-scientific context was related to the work of Mary Anning, a pioneering 19th century palaeontologist, who made significant fossil discoveries that contributed to the understanding of geology and evolution. Interactive and participatory activities, informed by the lives and work of these scientists, were designed to engage students in socio-scientific inquiry-based learning through a drama-based pedagogy. These dramatised inquiries promoted the development of scientific citizenship competencies. Scrutiny of data collected through multiple methods suggested that, by extending opportunities for learners to participate in these dramatised lessons, understanding sustainability became more salient for the students. Outcomes suggest several distinctive affordances offered by dramatisation when supporting understanding about sustainability and the development of scientific citizenship.

Backsourcing Flexibility in IT Services Contracts	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						contingent claims analysis; demand trigger value; demand uncertainty; financial economics; IT services; outsourcing; real options; service science; valuation; vendors; volatility	REAL OPTIONS PERSPECTIVE; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS; INTERORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS; PORTFOLIO REPLICATION; VENDORS PERSPECTIVE; RISK-MANAGEMENT; GROWTH OPTIONS; SUPPLY CHAIN; DECISIONS; SOFTWARE	The emergence of new service science approaches to business problems in information technology (IT) services offers new, unusually relevant insights for the senior management of vendors in this business area. This research examines how service-level agreement contract flexibility should be designed when the technological and business market environments result in volatility of demand, based on an understanding of related changes in the cost drivers that underlie IT services contracts. Our approach draws on a blend of well-known methods from financial economics the real option pricing method and the contingent claims analysis method. In particular, our research examines a setting in which a vendor provides IT services to a client according to a prenegotiated IT services contract in the presence of demand volatility. We analyze the motivation of and value consequences for a vendor that offers the client the flexibility to opt out of the contract. For example, the client might switch to another vendor, or backsource and provide its own services internally. Our core results offer important foundational thinking for how to specify various forms of IT service-related flexibility in terms of put and call options from the point of view of an IT services vendor, so that their value and exercise timing can be estimated. We show that the client firm's demand trigger value for deciding when to backsource its IT services varies, and it depends on the degree of demand volatility as well as the usage-based fees charged by the vendor. Working from our modeling approach, we also are able to characterize the extent to which a vendor can benefit from bearing the costs of making a backsourcing flexibility option available to its client.

J	Bakhanova, E; Garcia, JA; Raffe, WL; Voinov, A				Bakhanova, Elena; Garcia, Jaime A.; Raffe, William L.; Voinov, Alexey			Targeting social learning and engagement: What serious games and gamification can offer to participatory modeling	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Stakeholder participation; Social learning; Engagement; Group facilitation; Game design	SYSTEMS THINKING INTERVENTIONS; MANAGEMENT FLIGHT SIMULATOR; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SUPPORT; COMMUNICATION; EDUCATION; TAXONOMY; IMPROVE; SCIENCE; DESIGN	Serious games and gamification are useful tools for learning and sustaining long-term engagement in the ac-tivities that are not meant to be entertaining. However, the application of game design in the participatory modeling context remains fragmented and mostly limited to user-friendly interfaces, storytelling, and visualization for better representation of the simulation models. This paper suggests possible extensions of game design use for each stage of the participatory modeling process, aiming at better learning, communication among stakeholders, and overall engagement. The proposed extensions are based on the effects that different types of game-like applications bring to the aspects of social learning and the contribution of gamification to engagement, motivation, and enjoyment of some activities. We conclude that serious games and gamification have a high potential for improving the quality of the participatory modeling process, while also highlighting additional research that is needed for designing particular practical gamified applications in this context.

Eye-tracked data were investigated by means of static early attention and dynamic educational process mining (EPM) analysis and combined with learning performance and retrospective interview data. All students seem to struggle with the map's radial structure during initial reading. Also, the picture's position in the map diverts students from consecutively reading interconnected branches. EPM analyses revealed different reading patterns in proceeding reading behavior. Students receiving a text first, seem to grasp the radial structure slightly more and show higher information integration attempts. They also attained higher free recall and coherence scores. The study concludes with instructional design principles for urgently needed explicit visual literacy instruction in elementary grades.

Further research has suggested a close relationship between consciously and unconsciously triggered response inhibition. To date, however, the effect of reward on unconsciously triggered response inhibition has not been explored. To address this issue, participants in this study performed runs of a modified Go/No-Go task during which they were exposed to both high and low value monetary rewards presented both supraliminally and subliminally. Participants were informed that they would earn the reward displayed if they responded correctly to each trial of the run. According to the results, when rewards were presented supraliminally, a greater unconsciously triggered response inhibition was observed for high-value rewards than for low-value rewards. In contrast, when rewards were presented subliminally, no enhanced unconsciously triggered response inhibition was observed. Results revealed that supraliminal and subliminal rewards have distinct effects on unconsciously triggered response inhibition. These findings have important implications for extending our understanding of the relationship between reward and response inhibition.

However, only a few have considered whether voting changes adjacent civic dispositions and behaviors. In this paper, we explore the effects of voting shocks on young citizens' political interest, memberships, social awareness, and political knowledge in the lead up to the voting experience ("upstream") and in the months and years after ("downstream"). To do so, we use a unique combination of large survey data from two countries paired with an exact date-of-birth regression discontinuity design. We find that eligibility to vote voluntarily and exposure to compulsory voting-despite eliciting large turnout increases-have precisely estimated null effects on young people's upstream or downstream civic engagement. While voting may be an important experience, it appears to have smaller transformative effects than previously thought.

Its main goal is to analyse teenagers??? critical thinking to manage scientific information in social networks. We analysed 95 ninth graders??? quality of argumentation on their degree of agreement and their degree of credibility of a fake news item. The design included a dependent variable (argumentative competence), two independent variables (degree of agreement, degree of credibility) and a covariate (reading comprehension). A significant correlation was found between the degree of agreement and the degree of credibility. In addition, the degree of credibility decreases significantly as reading comprehension increases. Students who positioned themselves against the claim of the fake news and those who did not believe it showed higher argumentative quality in their texts than those who both agreed with and believed it. These results bring evidence of the confirmation bias claim when we apply it to fake news. We tend to accept information that confirms our prior beliefs uncritically. Similarly, 83% of those who did not believe the content of the news would consult an additional text, compared to 62.5% of those who agreed with it. This is a result that highlights the urgency of implementing educational guidelines to help students develop critical skills to manage fake news.

In this study, we investigate both the product characteristics and EoL processing of robotic vacuum cleaner (RVC), as a case of emerging electronic product, in order to understand the recovery fate of different materials and its linkage to product design. Ten different brands of RVC were dismantled and their material composition and design profiles were studied. Another 125 RVCs (349 kg) were used for an experimental trial at a conventional 'shred-and-separate' type preprocessing plant in Denmark. A detailed material flow analysis was performed throughout the recycling chain. The results show a mismatch between product design and EoL processing, and the lack of practical implementation of 'Design for EoL' thinking. In the best-case scenario, only 47% of the total materials in RVCs are ultimately recycled. While this low material recovery is mainly due to the lower plastic recycling rate, other market realities and the complex material flows in the recycling chain also contribute to it The study provides a robust methodological approach for assessing the EoL performance based on the knowledge of a product and its complex recycling chain. The lessons learned can be used to support both the design and EoL processing of products with similar features, which carry a high potential for resource recovery, especially at the initial stage of the recycling chain.

However, consumers who focus on today rather than tomorrow or consumers who downplay or underestimate risks might pay little attention to warnings. The aim of the present study was to explore whether time orientation and perceived risk of sodium consumption may moderate the influence of sodium warnings on food choices. An online study involving 498 Uruguayan participants was carried out. Participants evaluated pairs of bread packages differing in three 2-level variables (sodium warning, type of bread and brand) and were asked to indicate the one they would choose if they were in a supermarket. Then, they answered a scale on `consideration of future consequences' adapted to eating habits, and responded to statements measuring perceived risk of sodium consumption. Results revealed that sodium warnings had a significant effect on participants' choices. However, the efficacy of warnings was moderated by time orientation and risk perception. A focus on immediate consequences and thinking that the risk associated with sodium consumption can be compensated, decreased the efficacy of the sodium warning. These results provide experimental evidence of the potential of warnings to discourage consumption of products with high sodium content and suggest that communication campaigns accompanying the introduction of warnings should promote a future-oriented vision on eating habits, raise risk awareness and stress that the risks are not easily compensated.

SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH CARE			English	Article						risk factor; lifestyle intervention; empowerment; medicalisation; perceived health; women	FOLLOW-UP; HEALTH; MORTALITY	Objective - To understand the experience of being at risk and of participating in health Interventions. How is information about risk factors handled on an individual level with respect to feeling, thinking and doing? Design - Tape-recorded, open interviews, written out and analysed using a descriptive/analytical method. Setting - Selected women who had participated in a lifestyle Intervention programme aimed at reducing risk factors for cardiovascular disease in Stromstad, a community of 10000 inhabitants on the west coast of Sweden. Subjects - Eight women in the most active group who had had some contact with the project during the whole period 1985-94. Main outcome measures - The creation of core concepts as a result of close text reading through codes and categories. Results - Three core concepts in relation to the handling of risk factors were identified: there is no one but yourself to rely on, resisting invasion, and living with incompatibility, based respectively on the subjects' self-efficacy and self-awareness, their ways of maintaining a good life and their trying to understand the risk-factor concept. Conclusion - Risk-factor-oriented health interventions focus on disease and create uncertainty as to the relationship between the concepts of risk and disease. The powerful health resources demonstrated by the women in this study to counterbalance the risk pre-occupation suggest changing to health-oriented interventions that focus on individual health resources.

Whereas there has been significant progress in the development of technologies controlling the heat to simulate thermal sensation, there is a lack of understanding about how to utilize it in designing interactive systems. We propose the term "thermal expression'' to signify the activity of controlling a particular amount of heat with intention or the heat generated as a result of that activity to crystallize our new view to the heat and a systematic way of thinking about the quality and the structure of the thermal expression. Focusing on the interpersonal communication domain, we explored the expressive quality of the heat through a prototyping approach deploying the heat-based communication devices that we developed in the daily life environment of normal users. We discovered the characteristics of thermal expression and the design opportunities for thermal application development, especially for interpersonal communication. The emotional value and the role of heat as a communication medium are discussed.

Identification of small-molecule protein-protein interaction inhibitors for NKG2D	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						protein-protein interaction; inflammation; -encoded library; NKG2D	IMMUNORECEPTOR NKG2D; LIGAND RECOGNITION; INDUCED FIT; RECEPTOR; PLASTICITY; INTEGRATION; EFFICIENCY; BINDING	NKG2D (natural-killer group 2, member D) is a homodimeric transmembrane receptor that plays an important role in NK, & gamma;& delta;+, and CD8+ T cell-mediated immune responses to environmental stressors such as viral or bacterial infections and oxidative stress. However, aberrant NKG2D signaling has also been associated with chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and as such NKG2D is thought to be an attractive target for immune intervention. Here, we describe a comprehensive small-molecule hit identification strategy and two distinct series of protein-protein interaction inhibitors of NKG2D. Although the hits are chemically distinct, they share a unique allosteric mechanism of disrupting ligand binding by accessing a cryptic pocket and causing the two monomers of the NKG2D dimer to open apart and twist relative to one another. Leveraging a suite of biochemical and cell-based assays coupled with structure-based drug design, we established tractable structure- activity relationships with one of the chemical series and successfully improved both the potency and physicochemical properties. Together, we demonstrate that it is possible, albeit challenging, to disrupt the interaction between NKG2D and multiple protein ligands with a single molecule through allosteric modulation of the NKG2D receptor dimer/ligand interface.

With regard to receptive multilingualism, it is unclear to what extent predictability in context interplays with other linguistic factors in understanding a related but unknown language - a process called intercomprehension. We distinguish two dimensions influencing processing effort during intercomprehension: surprisal in sentential context and linguistic distance. Based on this hypothesis, we formulate expectations regarding the difficulty of designed experimental stimuli and compare them to the results from think-aloud protocols of experiments in which Czech native speakers decode Polish sentences by agreeing on an appropriate translation. On the one hand, orthographic and lexical distances are reliable predictors of linguistic similarity. On the other hand, we obtain the predictability of words in a sentence with the help of trigram language models. We find that linguistic distance (encoding similarity) and in-context surprisal (predictability in context) appear to be complementary, with neither factor outweighing the other, and that our distinguishing of these two measurable dimensions is helpful in understanding certain unexpected effects in human behaviour.

In Study 1, 4- to 6year-olds rated mechanistic, teleological, circular, and non-explanations about biology. Only 6year-olds rated mechanistic explanations as better and non-explanations as worse at answering questions. To simplify the study design for younger children, Study 2 asked 4- and 5-year-olds to sort non-explanations as well as mechanistic explanations into "helpful" and "not helpful" boxes. Studies 3 and 4 examined what children remembered from explanations they sorted. Studies 2 and 3 found that 4- and 5-year-olds recognized that mechanistic explanations were helpful, but they struggled to consistently sort non-explanations as "not helpful" and they remembered little from the explanations. In contrast, Study 4 found that 6- to 8-year-olds were effective at sorting both types of explanations and remembered more information from mechanistic explanations than non-explanations. Individual differences for each study are discussed.

J	Rajala, E; Groendal, H; Lewerin, SS				Rajala, Elisabeth; Groendal, Hedvig; Sternberg Lewerin, Susanna			The first outbreak of African swine fever in Sweden: a survey of pig farmers&apos; perceptions of information received, risks, biosecurity measures and future prospects	ACTA VETERINARIA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article						ASF; Control; Impact; Pig production; Wild boar	MANAGEMENT; ATTITUDES	BackgroundAfrican swine fever (ASF), a viral hemorrhagic disease in domestic pigs and wild boar with up to 100% case fatality, was confirmed in Swedish wild boar in September 2023. The responsible authorities launched a control programme to eradicate the infection. The aim of the current study was to understand (i) how Swedish pig farmers have perceived the information issued by authorities and other stakeholders since the discovery of ASF in wild boar, (ii) which risks they see for introducing the infection to their farm, (iii) what biosecurity measures they have taken on their farms, and (iv) their outlook on the future. Such information is important for evaluating the effectiveness of the early stages of ASF control in Sweden. A questionnaire was designed and distributed to members of the Swedish pig producers' organisation.ResultsA total of 155 farmers responded to the survey (response rate 36%). Almost all respondents had received general information about ASF (91%, n = 138), and 72% (n = 109) had received information about how they can protect their farm from ASF introduction. A majority (87%, n = 118) thought the information was easy to understand, 90% (n = 137) that is was relevant, and 77% (n = 117) that they currently did not lack any information. If given the resources necessary, 58% (n = 84) of the farmers would like to take additional measures such as fencing, and heavily reduce or eradicate the wild boar population. Wild boars were considered the greatest risk for introduction of ASF into their herd (39%, n = 57), followed by people (30%, n = 44), and transports (16%, n = 23). Many farmers (66%, n = 88) had a positive outlook on the future, and 89% (n = 127) have not changed their plans for the future since the ASF outbreak.ConclusionsThe responding farmers were in general satisfied with the information received in the beginning of the ASF outbreak. The majority have a positive outlook on the future and the outbreak has not caused them to change their plans. Actions that were highlighted as important to safeguard Sweden's pig production included measures to control the wild boar population.

J	Lee, CF; Wu, HZ				Lee, Chin-Feng; Wu, Hua-Zhe			High-Capacity and High-Quality Reversible Data Hiding Method Using Recurrent Round-Trip Embedding Strategy in the Quotient Image	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						information hiding; reversible information hiding method; prediction error expansion; pixel value ordering	PREDICTION-ERROR EXPANSION; IOT APPLICATIONS; BLOCKCHAIN; INTERNET	In previous research, scholars always think about how to improve the information hiding algorithm and strive to have the largest embedding capacity and better image quality, restoring the original image. This research mainly proposes a new robust and reversible information hiding method, recurrent robust reversible data hiding (triple-RDH), with a recurrent round-trip embedding strategy. We embed the secret message in a quotient image to increase the image robustness. The pixel value is split into two parts, HiSB and LoSB. A recurrent round-trip embedding strategy (referred to as double R-TES) is designed to adjust the predictor and the recursive parameter values, so the pixel value carrying the secret data bits can be first shifted to the right and then shifted to the left, resulting in pixel invariance, so the embedding capacity can be effectively increased repeatedly. Experimental results show that the proposed triple-RDH method can effectively increase the embedding capacity up to 310,732 bits and maintain a certain level of image quality. Compared with the existing pixel error expansion (PEE) methods, the triple-RDH method not only has a high capacity but also has robustness for image processing against unintentional attacks. It can also be used for capacity and image quality according to the needs of the application, performing adjustable embedding.

J	Sun, CT; Ye, SH; Hsieh, HC				Sun, Chuen-Tsai; Ye, Shu-Hao; Hsieh, Hsi-Chien			Effects of student characteristics and question design on Internet search results usage in a Taiwanese classroom	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Human-computer interface; Interactive learning environments; Media in education; Multimedia/hypermedia systems; Navigation	AUTOMATIC ATTITUDE ACTIVATION; INFORMATION-SEEKING; WEB; STRATEGIES; TASK; KEYWORDS; BEHAVIOR; NOVICES; EXPERTS; ENGINE	A large percentage of students who use Internet search engines accept the results they are given without challenge, which conflicts with many learning theories that emphasize exploration. Longer and more in-depth searches require critical analyses of results as part of a process that is thought to produce better learning outcomes. With the development of social media, social motivation is increasingly considered an important factor in learning. To boost motivation for knowledge exploration, many instructors are adding elements of high interest to students to their teaching materials and activities. Here we investigate the effects of social motivation-associated priming on learner behaviors involving search engine results, using differences in learner characteristics (peer relationships and math skills) and search question type (add-on and integrated) as the main distinguishing factors. Our sample consisted of 81 students between the ages of 14 and 15 in a junior high school located in northern Taiwan. All of the participants were experienced in using computers, the Web, and search engines. Our results indicate (a) no significant effects of peer relationships or prior math achievement on the use of search results in that subject area; (b) the use of add-on questions (i.e., presenting math questions after presenting interpersonal relationship questions) encourages the appropriate use of summary results; and (c) the use of integrated questions (i.e., learners read stories involving a mix of interpersonal relationship and math information before addressing search questions) encourages students to read more information from search results rather than focusing on finding single "correct" answers. We interpret the third finding as evidence of greater enjoyment of exploration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Immediately before viewing the art, participants provided demographic information and answered one open-ended question Immediately after viewing the art, participants answered the same open-ended question, one additional open-ended question, and completed quantitative survey questions. Results: Overall, public reactions to the concept art were positive. Qualitative and quantitative data indicated that the public thought the exhibit was appealing, stimulated learning, dispelled myths, spurred desire to have conversations about hot flashes, and increased empathy for women with menopausal hot flashes. Conclusions: The exhibit concept art was appealing and was reported to have a positive impact on the public. Study findings provide support for building the exhibit full-scale as a traveling educational resource that might change public discourse around menopausal hot flashes.

Inspired by the image-to-image translation work based on convolutional neural network model and the heterogeneous information fusion thought, we propose a novel cloud removal method in this paper. The approach can be roughly divided into two steps: in the first step, a specially designed convolutional neural network (CNN) translates the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images into simulated optical images in an object-to-object manner; in the second step, the simulated optical image, together with the SAR image and the optical image corrupted by clouds, is fused to reconstruct the corrupted area by a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a particular loss function. Between the first step and the second step, the contrast and luminance of the simulated optical image are randomly altered to make the model more robust. Two simulation experiments and one real-data experiment are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method on Sentinel 1/2, GF 2/3 and airborne SAR/optical data. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms that also employ SAR images as auxiliary data.

This paper analyzes the characteristics of static phased mission system and the reliability optimization model. The classical reliability optimization model does not take full consideration of the attribute information of optimization objectives and meanwhile neglects a great indicator-failure loss. This paper adds a fault-loss function to the classical Dhingra model, which improves the original model. In the view of the multi-objective weighted grey targets decision thought, this paper establishes a new complex product reliability optimization design model, designs the solving algorithm of the model, and studies the reliability optimization problem combined with a typical four stage system. The results of the example validate the validity of the model and the effectiveness of the algorithm.

Large scale social platforms are currently investing important resources into automatically detecting and classifying hateful content, without much success. On the other hand, the results reported by state-of-the-art systems indicate that supervised approaches achieve almost perfect performance but only within specific datasets, most of them in English language. In this work, we analyze this apparent contradiction between existing literature and actual applications. We study closely the experimental methodology used in prior work and their generalizability to other datasets. Our findings evidence methodological issues, as well as an important dataset bias. As a consequence, performance claims of the current state-of-the-art have become significantly overestimated. The problems that we have found are mostly related to data overfitting and sampling issues. We discuss the implications for current research and re-conduct experiments to give a more accurate picture of the current state-of-the art methods. Moreover, we design some baseline approaches to perform cross-lingual experiments, using English and Spanish datasets. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Dou, S; Wang, Z				Dou, Shan; Wang, Zhen			INFLUENCE OF COLOR EMOTION EXPRESSION IN PACKAGING DESIGN ON PSYCHOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR OF PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION	PSYCHIATRIA DANUBINA			English	Article						bipolar depression; emotion management; color; mental nursing	ANXIETY	Background: Depression is a group of diseases with high incidence rate, high recurrence and high suicide rate, which is characterized by low mood, slow thinking and decreased interest. It seriously affects the social function of patients. Color is the most sensitive information of human beings and the fastest reflection of visual nerve. The impact of color on human physiology and psychology is both sensitive and fast. When people observe various objects outside, the first reflection is the color pole, which is the visual information symbol that is the most sensitive to visual stimulation and the fastest response among the elements of human vision. In this paper, the rehabilitation training of packaging design based on color psychology was carried out for patients with bipolar depression, in order to improve the negative emotion of patients with bipolar depression and improve the training effect. Subjects and methods: 140 patients with bipolar depression were randomly divided into observation group and control group, with 70 cases in each group. Among them, all subjects were between 18 and 60 years old, educated above junior high school, able to understand the contents of the scale and questionnaire. Before and after the intervention, HAMD scale, positive and negative emotion scale, insight and treatment attitude questionnaire were used to evaluate. Results: There was no difference between the two groups before training (P > 0.05). After training, the scores of this group decreased significantly (P < 0.001), and the scores of positive and negative emotions were significantly better than those before training (P < 0.001). The scores of insights and treatment attitude of all subjects after training were significantly better than those before training (P < 0.001). After training, the score of the observation group was slightly higher than that of the control group. Conclusions: On the basis of routine nursing of mental diseases, adopting the packaging design rehabilitation training scheme based on color psychology is beneficial to adjust or improve the emotional state of patients. Properly adjusting the cold and warm colors will help patients maintain stable emotions, reduce clinical risks and promote disease recovery.

In a previous study, we established the need for a web-based app providing personalized information and interactive functionalities among couples undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection with surgically retrieved sperm. Objective: This study aimed to design, develop, and qualitatively evaluate a multifaceted web-based app for infertile couples undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection with surgically retrieved sperm during their treatment trajectory. Methods: The web-based app was developed in three phases: (1) we established a patient-centered functional design, (2) developed the app in collaboration with medical and technical professionals, and (3) qualitatively evaluated the app among couples using a think-aloud method. Results: The basis of the app is the couple's visualized treatment trajectory. The app provides personalized and interactive functionalities; for example, customized information and communication options. During qualitative evaluation, myFertiCare was highly appreciated and received a median score of 8 out of 10. The main improvements made upon conclusion of the think-aloud sessions were related to faster login and easier app navigation.

At present, the traditional mode of communicating scientific health knowledge and information technology is interchangeable, resulting in the emergence of a new mode of communicating health literacy. To publicize health education and health literacy in a targeted way, to meet the public's needs, and to understand how the public's demand for subjects, contents, and forms of health literacy service has changed in the era of COVID-19, the investigation of public's demand for health information and health literacy was conducted. Objective This study aims to understand the differences in demand for health literacy service providers, contents, channels, forms, and facilities among Chinese citizens with different genders, ages, education levels, economic conditions, and living environments, and to provide reasonable recommendations for developing public health literacy. Methods Questionnaire Star was used to conduct a large sample of random online surveys. In Wuhan, Hubei Province, 2184 questionnaires were issued, 8 invalid questionnaires were eliminated, and 2176 were recovered, with an effective rate of 99.6%. IBM SPSS Statistics 20 was utilized to analyze the survey data. Results (1) In health literacy service providers selected by the public, the proportion of government departments or government collaboration with other institutions exceeded 73%, indicating that health literacy services are public goods; (2) access to health literacy services was lower in township areas than in urban areas (P < 0.001, 3) internet media and communicating with acquaintances, which have the highest popularity rate, were also the two channels that were least trusted by the public; and (4) the differences in contents and service channels of health literacy among residents with different genders, ages, education levels, economic status, and living environments were statistically significant. Conclusions (1) It is recommended to establish an integrated health literacy service model with multi-center supply. Government departments, medical institutions, and media should cooperate effectively to provide health literacy services. (2) The government should pay attention to the fairness of health education and strengthen the supply of health literacy services in township areas. (3) It is critical to strengthen the public's ability to discriminate network information and pay attention to scientific thinking cultivation. (4) Health literacy service providers must focus on the differences between public demands and improve the connotation of health literacy services.

Searching for the universality of nudging: A cross-cultural comparison of the information effects of reminding people about familial support	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FUTURE THINKING; EVOLUTION; ECONOMICS; RISK	Nudging is a method for eliciting a desired behavior. One approach to nudging involves information provision. When information presented for this purpose is designed from an evolutionary perspective, it may reveal a deeper level of rationality within human decision-making that might otherwise appear to be irrational. Based on insights from the evolution of altruism, we previously designed a message to remind people of the benefits they have received from the actions of relatives to realize industrialization. We then demonstrated that using this message in Japan was effective at moderating extreme risk-averse attitudes toward air pollution resulting from industrialization. However, the universality of the intervention effect, including whether it could be affected by exogenous factors, was not explored. Therefore, in the present study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial based on an online survey carried out in Japan, Canada, and the US. The intervention was shown to be effective in all the three countries, but the effect size varied according to segment. Although women showed more intervention effects than men in Japan and the US, no significant sex difference was observed in Canada. In terms of personality traits, higher agreeableness significantly contributed to the intervention effects. The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated many lifestyle changes, was found to weaken the intervention effect by increasing the message effect in the control group. We propose that this effect was caused by an increased perception of familial support in everyday life. These results suggest that the nudge message was universally effective, although the effect size might have been affected by cultural factors and social events.

Multi-method training for a colour-to-sound sensory substitution device - design and evaluation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article							INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY; EXPERIENCE; PERFORMANCE; SCIENCE; VISION	Sensory substitution is thought to be a promising non-invasive assistive technology for people with complete loss of sight because it provides inaccessible visual information via a preserved modality. However, Sensory Substitution Devices (SSDs) are still rarely used by visually impaired persons, possibly due to a lack of structured and supervised training that could be offered alongside these devices. Here, we developed and evaluated a training program that supports the usage of a recently developed colour-to-sound SSD - the Colorophone. Following our recently proposed theoretical model of SSD development, we propose that this training should help people with complete loss of sight to learn how to efficiently use the device by developing relationships between the components of the user-environment-technology system. We applied systematic case studies combined with a mixed-method approach to evaluate the efficacy of this SSD training pro-gram. Five blind users underwent ca. 22 h of training, divided into four main parts: identification of the users' individual characteristics and adaptations; senso-rimotor training with the device; semi-structured explorations with the device; and evaluation of the training. We demonstrated that this training allows users to successfully acquire a set of skills (i.e., master the sensorimotor contingencies required by the device, develop visual-like perceptual skills, as well as learn about colours) and progress along developmental trajectories (e.g., switch from serial to parallel information processing, recognize more complex colours, increase environment and task complexity). Importantly, we identified individual differences in learning strategies (i.e., sensorimotor vs. metacognitive strategy) that had an impact on the users training progress and required the training assistants (TAs) to apply different assistive strategies. Additionally, we described the crucial role of a (non-professional) training assistant in the training progress: this person facilitates the development of relationships between elements of the user-environment -technology system by supporting a metacognitive learning strategy, thereby reducing the risk of abandonment of the SSD. Our study shows the importance for SSD development of well-designed, tailored training, and it provides new insights into the process of SSD-related perceptual learning.

J	op den Buijs, T; van Doorn, E				op den Buijs, Tessa; van Doorn, Erik			What women want! A study on the motivation of young women to join the Netherlands armed forces	CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Motivation of young women; HR transition; Recruitment; Stereotypical thinking; Inclusion of women		This article provides insight into the motivation of young women to join the armed forces and to choose a career in the military. This insight explains why women are still underrepresented in the Netherlands armed forces and can optimize future recruitment programs. An online Dutch questionnaire was completed by 148 women (out of a total of 483 respondents). We analyzed the data of these young women in comparison to the men in this sample to better interpret the descriptive findings. Three research questions focus on whether young Dutch women are interested in the armed forces, how they perceive the Netherlands armed forces, and what their motivation is for choosing a career in the military.Women are very enthusiastic and interested in the armed forces. They know what they want, but they are not aware of the military's efforts to be an inclusive organization. Society's stereotypical thinking about the role of women and the image of the military may have led women to assume that the military environment is not such a good fit after all. Descriptive and injunctive norms, intrinsic motivating work aspects and the self-efficacy of young women appear to be important aspects in the motivation of young women and should be taken into consideration when designing new recruitment and communication strategies and promoting inclusiveness. Women also need more information about the different types of flexible contracts and career paths available within the armed forces. Female role models are important to inform, empower and win over women. The Netherlands armed forces should invest in the recruitment process and anticipate the interest, perception and motivation of young Dutch women to encourage them to apply and reduce stereotypical thinking.

There are multiple people involved in this process: a data engineer who processes and restructures the data, a data scientist who develops statistical models, and a domain expert who informs the design of the data pipeline and consumes its results for decision support. Although there are multiple data interaction tools for data scientists, few exist to allow domain experts to interact with data meaningfully. Designing systems for domain experts requires careful thought because they have different needs and characteristics from other end users. There should be an increased emphasis on the system to optimize the experts' interaction by directing them to high-impact data tasks and reducing the total task completion time. We refer to this optimization as amplifying domain expertise. Although there is active research in making machine learning models more explainable and usable, it focuses on the final outputs of the model. However, in the clinical domain, expert involvement is needed at every pipeline step: curation, cleaning, and analysis. To this end, we review literature from the database, human-computer information, and visualization communities to demonstrate the challenges and solutions at each of the data pipeline stages. Next, we present a taxonomy of expertise amplification, which can be applied when building systems for domain experts. This includes summarization, guidance, interaction, and acceleration. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our taxonomy with a case study.

A federated EHR network data completeness tracking system	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						data completeness; data quality; electronic health records; systems thinking	DATA QUALITY; HEALTH; THINKING	Objective: The study sought to design, pilot, and evaluate a federated data completeness tracking system (CTX) for assessing completeness in research data extracted from electronic health record data across the Accessible Research Commons for Health (ARCH) Clinical Data Research Network. Materials and Methods: The CTX applies a systems-based approach to design workflow and technology for assessing completeness across distributed electronic health record data repositories participating in a queryable, federated network. The CTX invokes 2 positive feedback loops that utilize open source tools (DQ(e)-c and Vue) to integrate technology and human actors in a system geared for increasing capacity and taking action. A pilot implementation of the system involved 6 ARCH partner sites between January 2017 and May 2018. Results: The ARCH CTX has enabled the network to monitor and, if needed, adjust its data management processes to maintain complete datasets for secondary use. The system allows the network and its partner sites to profile data completeness both at the network and partner site levels. Interactive visualizations presenting the current state of completeness in the context of the entire network as well as changes in completeness across time were valued among the CTX user base. Discussion: Distributed clinical data networks are complex systems. Top-down approaches that solely rely on technology to report data completeness may be necessary but not sufficient for improving completeness (and quality) of data in large-scale clinical data networks. Improving and maintaining complete (high-quality) data in such complex environments entails sociotechnical systems that exploit technology and empower human actors to engage in the process of high-quality data curating. Conclusions: The CTX has increased the network's capacity to rapidly identify data completeness issues and empowered ARCH partner sites to get involved in improving the completeness of respective data in their repositories.

Here, a project is described that sought to get a group of older people to think creatively about their needs and desires for technological support through the medium of paint. The artistic expression technique described in this article allowed the identification of issues that had also been found by previous research that used a range of different techniques. This indicates that the approach shows promise, as it allows information to be gathered in an environment that is comfortable and familiar using methods already known by the participants and which they find enjoyable. It provides a complement (or possible alternative) to standard protocols and has the potential benefit of extracting even richer information as the primary task for participants is enjoyable in its own right and is not associated with an interrogative process. Furthermore, it is argued that some of the key risks of traditional approaches are lessened or removed by the naturalistic setting of this approach.

J	Dreyer, J; van der Walt, K; Denton, R				Dreyer, Johan; Van Der Walt, Kobus; Denton, Rudy			The origin of everything: "And there was evening and there was morning"	TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE			English	Article						creation; creationism; normative materialism; unguidedprocess; random process; intelligent design; God; evolution; chance; Big Bang; universe; life; science and religion	LIFE; WORLD	Darwin's 18th century theory of evolution was an elegant, sensible, and logical explanation of observed data. It was embraced by the scientific community of the time since it offered an alternative to the creation narrative in the Bible. Proponents of the theory were convinced that the origin and multitude of life on earth could be fully explained by evolution and natural selection. Over time, the theory of evolution acquired normative status, which led to the totality of human knowledge being interpreted through a filter of random chance. Opponents of this materialistic view were in many cases branded as fringe figures.Subsequently, however, science and technology have developed dramatically, and new observations have led to a growing number of questions that cannot be explained by an unguided, random process. In this article (the first in a series of four on this topic), a few examples of such contemporary observations are presented. These include:& BULL; Origin of the universeSeminal work by scholars such as Slipher, Hubble, Lemaitre, Einstein and others indicate that the universe came into being at a specific moment. This was contrary to the idea of a perpetual universe, as believed by e.g., classical Greek scholars. The implication of a moment of creation is that there must have been a "cause of creation" (Creator) that is not bounded by, or subject to, matter, energy, space, or time, because none of these existed before the moment of creation.& BULL; Fine-tuning of the universeSince the 1950's, numerous scientific discoveries indicate that life depends on a highly unlikely combination of forces, characteristics, and balances in the universe, such as e.g., fundamental forces that have exactly the right magnitudes, contingent properties that exhibit exactly the right characteristics, as well as the initial configuration of matter and energy perfectly tuned to allow for anything to exist. These life-permitting properties of the universe fall within highly improbable, precise boundaries, commonly referred to as "anthropic contingencies" by materialist scientists. If any one of these properties were changed even in an infinitesimal way, the life-promoting conditions, found in the universe would not exist. Not only is the observed simultaneous, conditional accuracy highly improbable, but there appears to be no conceivable physical cause (reason) or philosophical necessity why these parameters exhibit the particular values they do. Contrary to scientists with a materialistic worldview, who attribute the fine-tuning to a happy accident (a random accident of physics), a growing number of scientists and philosophers conclude that the universe was designed with great care by a Creator who transcends time, matter, space, and energy in order to have achieved the fine-tuning of conditions before the moment of creation.& BULL; Age of the universeThe age of the universe extends from the time of the Big Bang, which is currently calculated to have occurred 13.8 billion years ago (& PLUSMN;0.020 billion years), according to the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (?CDM) model. Contemporary empirical evidence indicates that the universe consists of approximately 68% dark energy, 27% dark matter and only 5% matter. This means that although the ?CDM theory has a thorough scientific basis, it still represents imperfect knowledge of only approximately 5% of everything that exists.& BULL; Origin of the earthThe conditions necessary for the earth to form have been determined before the moment of creation. A literal understanding of the narrative in Genesis is problematic since the sun and the moon were only created on day four. To summarily interpret the first 3 "days" of creation as 24-hour days is therefore without any justification, because the heavenly bodies that are responsible for 24-hour days as we know them, did not yet exist. From this it can be deduced that a 24-hour-a-day interpretation of the days of creation, is at most a human construct and that the repeated use of the words, "and there was evening, and there was morning", should rather be seen as a delimitation of events.& BULL; Age of the earthPre-scientific thinking about the age of the earth was dominated by a fundamentalist, biblical paradigm. This included calculating the age of the earth according to generations given in the Bible, which resulted in general consensus that the earth was created on "the entrance of the night preceding the 23rd day of October [...] the year before Christ 4004". Geological and paleontological evidence however made it clear that well over 6,000 years must have passed in the formation of the earth. This empirical evidence was ultimately the cause of the literal understanding of Genesis' six days of creation being openly questioned. Immanent 195 scientists such as Newton (1687), Hutton (1788) and Lyell (1830-1833) took a uniformitarian paradigm as point of departure in their calculations about the age of the earth. Contemporary evidence indicates that the earth's age is approximately 4,6 billion years.& BULL; Origin and age of lifeThe origin and age of humankind has been central in debates about evolution since the publication of the theory almost 200 years ago. Currently, however, sources of information such as genetics and genetically based studies (e.g., Ontogeny, Phylogeny and Evolutionary Biology) have, together with developments in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis since the early 1970's, substantially added to the knowledge obtained from the fossil record. A vast volume of data must have been generated to account for the multitude of life observed (including humankind). The visible range and depth of information, as well as the survival rate within the time available, make "coincidence" as a method of gathering the information, logically impossible. Only one out of every hundred species that could mutate survived, which means that to obtain the correct DNA information the mutation rate would have had to be 99% higher, or the period 99% longer than observed in natural science. The only plausible origin of such information is an intelligent designer.In conclusion, the central theoretical premise of this article series is that contemporary observations in all disciplines of natural science are best explained by the existence and involvement of God in creation. Academic integrity requires that scholars depart from a normative materialistic interpretation of empirical data (i.e., the a-priori exclusion of any metaphysical interpretations), which is currently still widely adhered to.The authors' point of departure is a Reformed3 understanding of reality. The four articles all have the same structure, namely a problem statement, a natural science discussion, an exploration of what information the Bible offers on the various topics, closed by a conclusion. The article series is supposed to provide a broad, critical overview of the topic of normative materialism in the natural sciences and no new research results per se are presented. However, the insights reached in the respective conclusions are unique, and the authors are of the opinion that they contribute to the existing knowledge about the relationship between faith and science.

The objective of this qualitative study was to help explain the findings of the trial by exploring Chinese patients' experience of seeking and receiving information before cardiac surgery. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 20 trial participants before discharge (ten from the preoperative education group; ten from the usual care control group). Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Results: A total of five themes were generated: the role of reputation and hierarchy; gaining strength from knowledge; information as a low priority; being kept in the dark; and learning through peer support. Conclusion: In health care systems where service users are given relatively little information, interventions designed to inform patients about their treatment are likely to have a much greater impact on their psychological health. Practice implications: Providers of services for patients undergoing cardiac. surgery in China should, be encouraged to incorporate information giving into routine practice, tailored according to individual need.

J	VanDerZanden, AM; Sandrock, D; Kopsell, D				VanDerZanden, Ann Marie; Sandrock, David; Kopsell, David			Student attitudes and perceptions of an wine problem-based learning case study in landscape management	HORTTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						teaching; problem solving; critical thinking; curriculum		Horticulture graduates entering the landscape (design, installation, and maintenance) segment of the green industry will be faced with a myriad of complicated decision scenarios. Graduates must be able to integrate their understanding of plant science, environmental and physical site constraints, and the human impact on built and natural landscapes to make complex decisions. The objectives of this project were to develop an online case study for use in landscape management and landscape construction courses, and to determine students' perceptions of using this virtual case study to practice active problem solving in landscape horticulture. After completing a scenario from the online case study, students were asked to complete a 20-question survey instrument consisting of open- and close-ended questions evaluating the case study. Sixty-nine surveys were returned and useable, for a response rate of 76.6%. Overall student attitudes and perceptions of the online case study were positive. Participants felt comfortable using the web-based format (4.3 of 5), and felt it was an effective way to deliver information (4.1). Furthermore, participants rated their ability to summarize the scenario data as 4.2 and also felt confident in their ability (4.1) to make a landscape management recommendation to the homeowner.

Interventions for BL have not been established.Objective: We examined the effects of postural-control training with different sensory reweighting on standing postural control in a patient with BL.Methods: The patient had BL to the left when standing or walking due to a left-side medullary and cerebellar infarct. This study was a single-subject A-B design with follow-up: Phase A was postural-control training with visual feedback; phase B provided reweighting plantar somatosensory information. Postural control, VST excitability, and SVV were measured.Results: At baseline and phase A, the patient could not stand with eyes-closed on a rubber mat, but became able to stand in phase B. The mediolateral center of pressure (COP) position did not change significantly, but the COP velocity decreased significantly during phase B and the follow-up on the firm surface. VST excitability was lower on the BL versus the non-BL side, and the SVV deviated to the right throughout the study.Conclusion: Postural-control training with reweighting somatosensory information might improve postural control in a patient with BL.

J	Tyminski, AM; Simpson, AJ; Land, TJ; Drake, C; Dede, E				Tyminski, Andrew M.; Simpson, Amber J.; Land, Tonia J.; Drake, Corey; Dede, Ercan			Prospective elementary mathematics teachers' noticing of childrens' mathematics: a focus on extending moves	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Teacher education-preservice; Elementary school education; Instructional activities and practices	THINKING; KNOWLEDGE; ABILITY	Professional noticing of children's mathematical thinking (Jacobs et al. in J Res Math Educ 41(2):169-202, 2010) is a construct that is used frequently to understand the ways in which teachers attend to, interpret, and respond to children's mathematical thinking. In this paper, we present our analysis of prospective elementary mathematics teachers' (PTs') responses to a pedagogical activity designed to engage them in an approximation (Grossman et al. in Teach Coll Rec 111(9): 2055-2100, 2009) of professional noticing of children's mathematical thinking in the moment of teaching, with a focus on developing responses which extend the student's thinking. PTs were provided two different examples of student work and a series of questions designed to elicit information about their ability to professionally notice student work. We present data and analysis of 73 PTs' abilities to engage in the individual skills associated with noticing as well as their abilities to use the skills cohesively in concert. Our results demonstrate the type of representation used determined PTs' success in all three facets of noticing, with a particular effect on interpreting. Further, our focus on a specific type of response move, along with the introduction of a scaffold for that response move, made a difference in PTs' ability to successfully respond to student work when compared to a prior study with the same PTs (Tyminski et al.2014). We unpack these results along with suggestions for pedagogical practice as well as directions for future research.

J	Peters, VL; Songer, NB				Peters, Vanessa L.; Songer, Nancy Butler			Evaluating the Usability of a Professional Modeling Tool Repurposed for Middle School Learning	JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Usability; Computer modeling; Learning technologies; GIS; Climate change	FRUSTRATION; FRAMEWORK; SOFTWARE; SUPPORT; DESIGN; GIS	This paper reports the results of a three-stage usability test of a modeling tool designed to support learners' deep understanding of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems. The design process involved repurposing an existing modeling technology used by professional scientists into a learning tool specifically designed for middle school students. To evaluate usability, we analyzed students' task performance and task completion time as they worked on an activity with the repurposed modeling technology. In stage 1, we conducted remote testing of an early modeling prototype with urban middle school students (n = 84). In stages 2 and 3, we used screencasting software to record students' mouse and keyboard movements during collaborative think-alouds (n = 22) and conducted a qualitative analysis of their peer discussions. Taken together, the study findings revealed two kinds of usability issues that interfered with students' productive use of the tool: issues related to the use of data and information, and issues related to the use of the modeling technology. The study findings resulted in design improvements that led to stronger usability outcomes and higher task performance among students. In this paper, we describe our methods for usability testing, our research findings, and our design solutions for supporting students' use of the modeling technology and use of data. The paper concludes with implications for the design and study of modeling technologies for science learning.

J	ABRAMSON, B				ABRAMSON, B			ON KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION IN BELIEF NETWORKS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article								Three focal elements of knowledge-based system design are (i) acquiring information from an expert, (ii) representing the information in a system-usable form, and (iii) using the information to draw inferences about specific problem instances. In the artificial intelligence (AI) literature, the first element is referred to as knowledge acquisition, while the second and third are embodied in a system's knowledge base and inference engine, respectively. AI, however, is not alone in its concern for these issues. Researchers in several of the statistical decision sciences, notably decision analysis (DA), have also investigated them. This paper discusses the use of belief networks-a formalism that lies somewhere between AI and DA-as an overall framework for knowledge-based systems. Unlike previous work, which has concentrated on either the networks' mathematical properties or on their implementation as a specific system, this paper is oriented towards the concerns of general system design. Concrete examples are drawn from one medical system (Pathfinder) and from one financial system (ARCO1), and in particular, from a consideration of their similarities and differences. The design principles abstracted from these systems suggests a powerful, coherent design philosophy guided by the simple thought: form follows function.

J	Muller-Gass, A; Campbell, K				Muller-Gass, A; Campbell, K			Event-related potential measures of the inhibition of information processing: I. Selective attention in the waking state	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						event-related potential; selective attention; waking state	AUDITORY SENSORY MEMORY; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; VISUAL-STIMULI; REM-SLEEP; FREQUENCY; WAVE; INTENSITY; COMPONENT	This article reviews the effects of selective attention on event-related potentials (ERPs). Attention has little, if any, effect on short-latency exogenous ERPs. The longer-latency ERIs can be markedly affected by manipulation of the subject's level of attention. For example, a late positive wave, P300, appears to occur only if subjects actively detect an infrequently occurring target stimulus. However, a number of other late positive waves may also occur independently of the direction of attention, particularly if elicited by highly biologically or psychologically relevant stimuli. Attention may also interact with an earlier, apparently exogenous, negative waveform, N1. This could be due to the overlapping and summating effect of an attentional-related waveform, the processing negativity. The presentation of a physically deviant stimulus occurring among a train of homogeneous standard stimuli will elicit another negative wave, the mismatch negativity (MMN). The MMN has traditionally been thought to occur independently of attention. More recent studies have, however, shown that attention can modulate the MMN. This may, however, be explained by the summating effects of other overlapping components. Interpreting the scalp-recorded ERP can therefore require judicious care. Design of experiments must take into account the fact that the magnitude of attentional. effects will depend on a number of different influences, some of which are very subtle and complex. A problem with any study in the waking and alert human is that the subject may not be able to completely ignore stimuli, in spite of instructions to do so. For this reason, the study of unconscious states, such as sleep, may prove to be especially fruitful in understanding the effects of attention in the waking state. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Methods: This study used qualitative methods. The purposive sample consisted of 8 clinicians and 14 patients. Clinicians rated the content's congruence with current medical practice. We used the clinicians' evaluations to revise the OTIS (TM) content; then each patient evaluated the revised OTIS (TM) modules using the thinking-aloud method and via structured interviews. Descriptive statistics were applied for demographic and clinical data, and for the clinicians' ratings. Content data usability and validity were analyzed using Content Analysis. Results: Clinicians identified deviations from current medical practice regarding content, language, and information structure of OTIS (TM). Seven rated OTIS (TM) as non-relevant for implementation into clinical practice. Five rated the program's content - with the stipulated adaptations - as important for patients. All patients encountered usability problems, mostly regarding the program's interface. Emerging categories from the patients' perspectives vis a vis content were knowledge acquisition, illness management, and partnership forming. Conclusion: Problems arose regarding OTIS's (TM) initial content validity and usability, demonstrating the need to establish the presented material's content validity and usability by involving clinicians and patients before its clinical implementation. Practice implications: High quality computer-learning-software is needed to enhance patient self-management. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Factors affecting willingness to share electronic health data among California consumers	BMC MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article						Consent; Ethics; Electronic health records; Health information exchange; Learning healthcare systems; Distributed research network	INFORMATION EXCHANGE; CLINICAL-RESEARCH; INFORMED-CONSENT; PATIENT PERSPECTIVES; PATIENTS ATTITUDES; MEDICAL-RESEARCH; PRIMARY-CARE; PARTICIPATION; RECORDS; DECISION	Background: Robust technology infrastructure is needed to enable learning health care systems to improve quality, access, and cost. Such infrastructure relies on the trust and confidence of individuals to share their health data for healthcare and research. Few studies have addressed consumers' views on electronic data sharing and fewer still have explored the dual purposes of healthcare and research together. The objective of the study is to explore factors that affect consumers' willingness to share electronic health information for healthcare and research. Methods: This study involved a random-digit dial telephone survey of 800 adult Californians conducted in English and Spanish. Logistic regression was performed using backward selection to test for significant (p-value <= 0.05) associations of each explanatory variable with the outcome variable. Results: The odds of consent for electronic data sharing for healthcare decreased as Likert scale ratings for EHR impact on privacy worsened, odds ratio (OR) = 0.74, 95% CI [0.60, 0.90]; security, OR = 0.80, 95% CI [0.66, 0.98]; and quality, OR = 0.59, 95% CI [0.46-0.75]. The odds of consent for sharing for research was greater for those who think EHR will improve research quality, OR = 11.26, 95% CI [4.13, 30.73]; those who value research benefit over privacy OR = 2.72, 95% CI [1.55, 4.78]; and those who value control over research benefit OR = 0.49, 95% CI [0.26, 0.94]. Conclusions: Consumers' choices about electronically sharing health information are affected by their attitudes toward EHRs as well as beliefs about research benefit and individual control. Design of person-centered interventions utilizing electronically collected health information, and policies regarding data sharing should address these values of importance to people. Understanding of these perspectives is critical for leveraging health data to support learning health care systems.

J	Kwon, D; Park, S; Ryu, JT				Kwon, Donghwoon; Park, Suwoo; Ryu, Jeong-Tak			A Study on Big Data Thinking of the Internet of Things-Based Smart-Connected Car in Conjunction with Controller Area Network Bus and 4G-Long Term Evolution	SYMMETRY-BASEL			English	Article						IoT; smart car; V2V; V2I; V2X; CAN bus; big data		A smart connected car in conjunction with the Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging topic. The fundamental concept of the smart connected car is connectivity, and such connectivity can be provided by three aspects, such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). To meet the aspects of V2V and V2I connectivity, we developed modules in accordance with international standards with respect to On-Board Diagnostics II (OBDII) and 4G Long Term Evolution (4G-LTE) to obtain and transmit vehicle information. We also developed software to visually check information provided by our modules. Information related to a user's driving, which is transmitted to a cloud-based Distributed File System (DFS), was then analyzed for the purpose of big data analysis to provide information on driving habits to users. Yet, since this work is an ongoing research project, we focus on proposing an idea of system architecture and design in terms of big data analysis. Therefore, our contributions through this work are as follows: (1) Develop modules based on Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, OBDII, and 4G-LTE; (2) Develop software to check vehicle information on a PC; (3) Implement a database related to vehicle diagnostic codes; (4) Propose system architecture and design for big data analysis.

J	Wastell, DG				Wastell, DG			The fetish of technique: Methodology as a social defence	INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						information systems; methodology; organizational learning; social defence	SYSTEMS	Methodology is a central issue in the theory and practise of information systems development. Structured methods, for instance, have been widely championed as providing a way of improving the quality of software systems. In this paper a case study is presented in which a mail order company made an attempt to implement a well-known methodology, Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology (SSADM). Far from facilitating the development process, SSADM encouraged a rigid and mechanical approach in which the methodology was applied in a ritualistic way which inhibited creative thinking. The argument is thus, that methodology, although ifs influence may be benign, has the potential to operate as a 'social defence', i.e. as a set of organizational rituals with the primary function of containing anxiety. The grandiose illusion of an all-powerful method allows practitioners to deny their feelings of impotence in the face of the daunting technical and political challenges of systems development. By withdrawing into this fantasy world the learning processes that are critical to the success of systems development are jeopardized. Methodology, whilst masquerading as the epitome of rationality, may thus operate as an irrational ritual, the enactment of which provides designers with a feeling of security and efficiency at the expense of real engagement with the task at hand.

Background: High-fidelity simulation is an increasingly popular pedagogical approach in nursing education. It provides students with opportunity to practice in a variety of simulations before entering clinical practice through a variety of real-life situational experiences and many institutions and educators have embraced this method for enhancing access to clinical skills. However, evidence for the effectiveness of the method in nursing teaching remains scarce. Design: A meta-analysis and systematic review. Methods: The following Chinese and English databases were searched for relevant articles: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, Web of Science, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wangfang. The search encompassed the establishment of these databases up until November 2021. Two reviewers separately entered the data into Review Manager Software 5.3. Results: A total of 15 studies were included in this study. High-fidelity simulation significantly increased nursing students' knowledge acquisition (SMD = 1. 37, 94%CI:0. 73-2. 00,P < 0. 0001), enhanced nursing students'professional skills (SMD = 0. 90, 95%CI:0. 36-1. 44,P = 0. 0001). In terms of clinical practice ability outcomes, high-fidelity simulation significantly improved the levels of critical thinking ability (SMD = 0. 58, 95% CI:0. 09-1. 07,P < 0. 00001), Clinical judgement ability (SMD = 1. 34, 95%CI:0. 38-2. 31,P=0. 006) and communication skills (SMD = 2. 62, 95%CI:1. 84-3. 40,P < 0. 001) of nursing students. Conclusions: We found that high-fidelity simulation have strong educational effects in nursing education, helping nursing students to increase knowledge acquisition, enhance professional skills and cultivate their clinical practice ability (critical thinking ability, communication skills and clinical judgement ability). These findings can provide guidance for nursing educators, indicating that the use of High-fidelity simulation teaching represents an effective solution for transitioning students from the learning environment to clinical practice.

To serve dynamic business models with the latest data, most system architecture tends to retrieve data from back-end systems in real-time. Numerous leading organizations have started to think of or are implementing two different platforms: read cluster and write cluster. In this article, we propose a model that adopts a data streaming system and a data caching mechanism for faster access to real-time and non-real-time data. This system only focuses on providing the read data elements and reducing most of the load in the existing cluster(s). Our mathematical and simulation performance analysis shows a clear distinction and comparison between the current and proposed systems architecture.	[Kamila, Nilayam Kumar; Bharti, P.

J	Selvaratnam, M				Selvaratnam, Mailoo			Students' Competence in some Problem Solving Skills throughout their B.Sc. Course	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY-SUID-AFRIKAANSE TYDSKRIF VIR CHEMIE			English	Article						Cognitive skills; thinking skills; problem solving; students' difficulties with cognitive skills	CHEMISTRY; SCIENCE	The main objective of the study was to test students' competence, throughout all their years (first, second and final years) of a B.Sc. course, in five important types of problem solving skills: information processing skills; skills concerning equations; graphical skills; three-dimensional visualization skills and inverse proportion reasoning skills. The study method used was the analysis of students' solutions to carefully designed questions. Students' performance was found to be poor for most of the skills tested. For example, more than half of all the students tested could not deduce information organized in equations, transform quantitative information in statements into equations and use inverse-proportion reasoning to do a calculation; and about a quarter of the students could not combine two equations and also could not visualize three-dimensionally the drawing of a cube. The study also showed that there wasn't much improvement in cognitive skills as students progressed from year to year. This suggests insufficient emphasis being placed on training students in cognitive skills in their courses. Since the development of students' competence in cognitive abilities should be an important objective of education courses, there is a need for explicitly identifying important cognitive skills and strategies and training students in them. Such training should be integrated with the teaching of content knowledge.

POP-PL: A Patient-Oriented Prescription Programming Language	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						DSL design; medical programming languages; medical prescriptions; empirical evaluation	VISUAL ANALOG; HEALTH-CARE; VALIDATION; SAFETY	A medical prescription is a set of health care instructions that govern the plan of care for an individual patient, which may include orders for drug therapy, diet, clinical assessment, and laboratory testing. Clinicians have long used algorithmic thinking to describe and implement prescriptions but without the benefit of a formal programming language. Instead, medical algorithms are expressed using a natural language patois, flowcharts, or as structured data in an electronic medical record system. The lack of a prescription programming language inhibits expressiveness; results in prescriptions that are difficult to understand, hard to debug, and awkward to reuse; and increases the risk of fatal medical error. This article reports on the design and evaluation of Patient-Oriented Prescription Programming Language (POP-PL), a domain-specific programming language designed for expressing prescriptions. The language is based around the idea that programs and humans have complementary strengths that, when combined properly, can make for safer, more accurate performance of prescriptions. Use of POP-PL facilitates automation of certain low-level vigilance tasks, freeing up human cognition for abstract thinking, compassion, and human communication. We implemented this language and evaluated its design attempting to write prescriptions in the new language and evaluated its usability by assessing whether clinicians can understand and modify prescriptions written in the language. We found that some medical prescriptions can be expressed in a formal domain-specific programming language, and we determined that medical professionals can understand and correctly modify programs written in POP-PL. We also discuss opportunities for refining and further developing POP-PL.

Initially, arginylation was thought to occur only on N -terminally exposed acidic residues, and its function was thought to be limited to targeting proteins for degradation. However, more recent data have shown that ATE1 can arginylate side chains of internal acidic residues in a protein without necessarily affecting metabolic stability. This greatly expands the potential targets and functions of arginylation, but tools for studying this process have remained limited. Here, we report the first global screen specifically for side-chain arginylation. We generate and validate "panarginylation" antibodies, which are designed to detect side-chain arginylation in any amino acid sequence context. We use these antibodies for immunoaffinity enrichment of side-chain arginylated proteins from wildtype and Ate1 knockout cell lysates. In this way, we identify a limited set of proteins that likely undergo ATE1-dependent side-chain arginylation and that are enriched in specific cellular roles, including translation, splicing, and the cytoskeleton.

Mapping the biosphere: exploring species to understand the origin, organization and sustainability of biodiversity	SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY			English	Article						biodiversity; bioinformatics; biomimicry; biosphere; conservation; cyberinfrastructure; ecology; evolution; international collaboration; organization of science; origins; species; sustainability; systematics; taxonomy; team work	RED SWEAT; TAXONOMY; TREE; INFRASTRUCTURE; CONSERVATION; SYSTEMATICS; CHALLENGES; QUESTIONS; MELBOURNE	The time is ripe for a comprehensive mission to explore and document Earth's species. This calls for a campaign to educate and inspire the next generation of professional and citizen species explorers, investments in cyber-infrastructure and collections to meet the unique needs of the producers and consumers of taxonomic information, and the formation and coordination of a multi-institutional, international, transdisciplinary community of researchers, scholars and engineers with the shared objective of creating a comprehensive inventory of species and detailed map of the biosphere. We conclude that an ambitious goal to describe 10 million species in less than 50 years is attainable based on the strength of 250 years of progress, worldwide collections, existing experts, technological innovation and collaborative teamwork. Existing digitization projects are overcoming obstacles of the past, facilitating collaboration and mobilizing literature, data, images and specimens through cyber technologies. Charting the biosphere is enormously complex, yet necessary expertise can be found through partnerships with engineers, information scientists, sociologists, ecologists, climate scientists, conservation biologists, industrial project managers and taxon specialists, from agrostologists to zoophytologists. Benefits to society of the proposed mission would be profound, immediate and enduring, from detection of early responses of flora and fauna to climate change to opening access to evolutionary designs for solutions to countless practical problems. The impacts on the biodiversity, environmental and evolutionary sciences would be transformative, from ecosystem models calibrated in detail to comprehensive understanding of the origin and evolution of life over its 3.8 billion year history. The resultant cyber-enabled taxonomy, or cybertaxonomy, would open access to biodiversity data to developing nations, assure access to reliable data about species, and change how scientists and citizens alike access, use and think about biological diversity information.

A blended learning course for playfully teaching programming concepts to school teachers	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Computer science education; Computational thinking; Multimedia learning; Professional teacher development; Scratch; Blended learning; MOOC		In this paper we report our experiences from a University outreach program with primary and secondary education teachers of various specialties. Our goal was to improve the coding abilities of teachers through Scratch activities. The participants can in turn teach their students, multiplying that way the benefitted population. To increase the participation and the completion percentage, the activities are designed as a course in Moodle realized in discrete runs with manageable groups, in a blended learning approach. The educational material was a combination of learning objects with specific objectives, video material and try-out activities. The course has been completed by 559 teachers from various Greek districts, mainly of regional areas, with a high completion rate of 65%. The participants found the experience highly satisfying, interesting and agreed that they had been supported effectively throughout the process. In the paper we describe the rational of our approach, the design and implementation phases of the project, the outcomes and the main findings of the evaluation of the user opinions.

Findings from Focus Groups Indicating what Chinese American Immigrant Women Think about Breast Cancer and Breast Cancer Screening	JOGNN-JOURNAL OF OBSTETRIC GYNECOLOGIC AND NEONATAL NURSING			English	Article						breast cancer; Chinese immigrant women; health beliefs; focus groups	PREVENTIVE SERVICES; MAMMOGRAPHY; DISPARITIES; BARRIERS; BELIEFS; HEALTH; RISK; INTERVENTIONS; VIETNAMESE; MORTALITY	Objectives To explore beliefs of Chinese American, immigrant women related to breast cancer and mammography. Design Qualitative description with semistructured focus groups. Setting Metropolitan Portland, Oregon. Participants Thirty eight foreign-born Chinese women, age 40 and older, in five focus groups. Methods Focus group discussions in Chinese were audiotaped, transcribed, and translated into English. Using a process of directed content analysis, group transcripts were coded for themes based on the discussion guide. Results Three main themes emerged from the analysis: knowledge and beliefs; support, communication, and educational needs; and access to care. Subthemes included beliefs such as barriers and facilitators to screening and perceptions about personal breast cancer risk. Several women were profoundly affected by the negative breast cancerrelated experiences of relatives and friends. Some common myths remain about causes and treatment of breast cancer. Conclusions Although Chinese American immigrant women share beliefs with other minority women in the United States, some culturally related barriers such as alienation due to cultural reasons for not sharing diagnosis with anyone and beliefs about the efficacy of Eastern versus Western medicine may affect adherence to screening and treatment. Facilitators included being told to get the test and getting screened for the sake of the family, whereas erroneous information about the cause of breast cancer such as diet and stress remained. Primary care providers such as advanced practice nurses should take into account culturally driven motivations and barriers to mammography adherence among Chinese American immigrant women. Provider/client interactions should involve more discussion about women's breast cancer risks and screening harms and benefits. Such awareness could open a dialogue around breast cancer that is culturally sensitive and nonthreatening to the patient. Information may need to be tailored to women individually or targeted to subethnic groups rather than using generic messages for all Asian immigrant women.

J	Deilami, FM; Sadr, H; Tarkhan, M				Deilami, Fatemeh Mohades; Sadr, Hossein; Tarkhan, Morteza			Contextualized Multidimensional Personality Recognition using Combination of Deep Neural Network and Ensemble Learning	NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Deep learning; Convolutional neural network; AdaBoost; Cognitive science; Contextualized personality recognition; Ensemble learning		Personality is generally expressed as the combination of behavior, emotion, motivation, and thoughts that aim to describe different aspects of human behavior based on a few stable and measurable characteristics. Considering the fact that our personality has a remarkable impact in our daily life, automatic recognition of a person's personality attributes can provide many essential practical applications in various aspects of cognitive science. Although various methods have been recently proposed for the task of personality recognition, most of them have mainly focused on human-designed statistical features and they did not make use of rich semantic information existing in users' generated texts while not only these contents can specify its writer's internal thought and emotion but also can be assumed as the most direct way for people to state their feeling and opinion in an understandable form. In order to make use of contextualized information as well as overcoming the complexity and handcraft feature requirement of previous methods, a deep learning based method for the task of contextualized personality recognition is proposed in this paper. Among various deep neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have demonstrated profound efficiency in natural language processing and especially personality detection. Owing to the fact that various filter sizes in CNN may influence its performance, we decided to combine CNN with AdaBoost, a classical ensemble algorithm, to consider the possibility of using the contribution of various filter lengths and gasp their potential in the final classification via combining various classifiers with respective filter size using AdaBoost. Our proposed method was validated on the Essay and YouTube datasets by conducting a series of experiments and the empirical results demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method on both datasets compared to both machine learning and deep learning methods for the task of personality recognition.

The Digital Transformation has enabled human actors, information systems, and smart products to interact with each other via multiple digital channels. The emergence of this hyper-connected world greatly leverages the prospects of business processes - but also boosts their complexity to a new level. We need to discuss how the BPM discipline can find new ways for identifying, analyzing, designing, implementing, executing, and monitoring business processes. In this research note, selected transformative trends are explored and their impact on current theories and IT artifacts in the BPM discipline is discussed to stimulate transformative thinking and prospective research in this field.

However, it constantly needs to be upgraded and enhanced due to technological and teaching changes. We aim at implementing an integrative OSCE method which employs informatics via the virtual patient within the pharmacy education curriculum at Taipei Medical University to enhance the pharmacy students' competence for using and disseminating information and to also improve critical thinking and clinical reasoning. Methods: We propose an integrated pharmacy OSCE which uses standardized patients and virtual patients (DxR Clinician). To evaluate this method, we designed four simulated stations and pilot tested with 19 students in the first year of the Master in Clinical Pharmacy program. Three stations were simulated as the inpatient pharmacy: 1) History and lab data collection; 2) Prescription review; 3) Calling physician to discuss potential prescription problems. The fourth was simulated as the patient ward station to provide patient education. A satisfaction questionnaire was administered at the end of the study. Results: Students rated their ability of 2.84, 2.37, 2.37, and 3.63 of 5 for each of the four stations, with the second and third being the most difficult stations. The method obtained an average rating of 4.32 of 5 for relevance, 4.16 for improving clinical ability, 4.32 for practicality in future healthcare work, and 4.28 for willing to have another similar learning experience. Conclusion: The integration of Virtual Patient in this study reveals that this assessment method is efficient and practical in many aspects. Most importantly, it provides the test taker with a much closer real-life clinical encounter. Although it is in many ways more difficult, it also provides for better " learning from mistakes" opportunities for test-takers. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A Case Study on Energy Literacy	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						human computer interaction; sustainable HCI; user-centered design; energy literacy; energy consumption; energy production		The adoption of energy efficiency practices and increased penetration of renewable energy sources in the power system are estimated to play a key role in the decarbonization of the energy sector, helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately fight climate change. To foster energy transition, energy education initiatives should primarily target the citizens and be designed adopting a User-Centered Design (UCD) approach and HCI methodologies. This paper describes how UCD/HCI can inform the design of citizens' energy education initiatives by presenting a case study-the development of an information platform targeting Madeiran citizens. The article describes the design process, from ideation to prototype and validation. Methods used in each phase (card sorting, semi-structured interviews, brainstorming sessions, think-aloud protocol and surveys) are described. Results of each phase and how they have informed the following steps are presented, together with a detailed description of the resulting information platform and initial results in terms of acceptance and interaction with the system. Our initial results support the hypothesis that adopting an HCI perspective can nurture the development of energy education initiatives targeting citizens, bringing a user-centered approach to the design of such initiatives.

It has been estimated that half of the world's population is from the Asian continent, mainly from China and India. Overpopulation may lead to many societal problems as well as to changes in the habitat. Birth control measures are thus needed to control this growth. However, for the last 50-60 years, there have not been any improvements in the field of contraception. Nevertheless, the immunocontraceptive vaccine is an emerging field, and it might be the only replacement for the existing mode of contraception for the next millennium. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are frequent, and their transmission rate increases yearly. As antibiotics are the prevailing treatment for this kind of infections, resistance in humans has increased; therefore, having effective antibiotic treatments for STIs is now a concern. Vaccines against STIs are now needed. It is thought that the improvements in the fields of proteomics, immunomics, metabolomics, and other omics will help in the successful development of vaccines. Objective: To collect and review the literature about recent advancements in immunocontraception and vaccines against sexually transmitted diseases/infections. Methods: Reliable scientific databases, such as PubMed Central, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Goggle Scholar, were consulted. Publications bearing important information on targeted antigens/immunogens for contraceptive vaccine design and advancements in vaccine development for STIs were gathered and tabulated, and details were analyzed as per the theme of each study. Results: Important antigens that have a specific role in fertility have been studied extensively for their contraceptive nature. Additionally, the advancements in the screening for the best antigens, according to their antigenic nature and how they elicit immune responses for an extended period were also studied. Herd immunity for STIs and advancements in the development of vaccines for syphilis, gonorrhea, and herpes simplex virus were also studied and tabulated in this review. An extensive knowledge on STIs vaccines was gained. Conclusion: This extensive review is aimed to provide insights for active researchers in vaccinology, immunology, and reproductive biology. Advancements in the development of vaccines for different STIs can be gathered as a wholesome report. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.	[Vickram, A.

Such effects are well known to carry over to living systems where numerous responses to the influence of vanadium have been well-documented; perhaps the most studied being the insulin-mimetic effect. Studies of the aqueous chemistry of vanadate provide an insight into the mechanisms by which vanadate affects enzyme systems and suggests methods for the elucidation of specific types of responses. Studies of the corresponding enzymes provide complementary information that suggests model vanadate systems be studied and provides clues as to functional groups that might be utilized in the development of selective enzyme inhibition. The insulin-mimetic effect is thought by many workers to originate in the effectiveness of vanadium as an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity. One, or more PTPases regulate the phosphotyrosine levels of the insulin receptor kinase domain. Appropriate ligands allow modification of the reactivity and function of vanadate. For instance, although the complex, ((CH3)(2)NO)(2)V(O)OH, is not quite as good an inhibitor of PTPase activity as is vanadate, it is much more effective in cell cultures for increasing glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. Studies of the chemistry of this complex provide an explanation of the efficacy of this compound as a PTPase inhibitor that is supported by computer modeling studies. Computer calculations using X-ray data of known PTPases as a basis for homology modeling then suggests functionality that needs to be addressed in developing selective PTPase inhibitors.

A review of risk management through BIM and BIM-related technologies	SAFETY SCIENCE			English	Review						BIM (Building Information Modelling); Digital technology; Risk management; BIM-based risk management; Construction safety	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; CONSTRUCTION SAFETY; 4D CAD; DESIGN; SYSTEM; BUILDINGS; IMPROVE; PROJECT; IMPACT; IMPLEMENTATION	Risk management in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) industry is a global issue. Failure to adequately manage risks may not only lead to difficulties in meeting project objectives but also influence land-use planning and urban spatial design in the future growth of cities. Due to the rapid development and adoption of BIM (Building Information Modelling) and BIM-related digital technologies, the use of these technologies for risk management has become a growing research trend leading to a demand for a thorough review of the state-of-the-art of these developments. This paper presents a summary of traditional risk management, and a comprehensive and extensive review of published literature concerning the latest efforts of managing risk using technologies, such as BIM, automatic rule checking, knowledge based systems, reactive and proactive IT (information technology)-based safety systems. The findings show that BIM could not only be utilised to support the project development process as a systematic risk management tool, but it could also serve as a core data generator and platform to allow other BIM -based tools, to perform further risk analysis. Most of the current efforts have concentrated on investigating technical developments, and the management of construction personnel safety has been the main interest so far. Because of existing technical limitations and the lack of "human factor" testing, BIM -based risk management has not been commonly used in real environments. In order to overcome this gap, future research is proposed that should: (1) have a multi-disciplinary system-thinking, (2) investigate implementation methods and processes, (3) integrate traditional risk management with new technologies, and (4) support the development process.

How Useful is electroencephalography in the Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders and the Delineation of Subtypes: A Systematic Review	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						autism spectrum disorders; autism; electroencephalography; functional connectivity; spectral analysis; information dynamics	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESTING-STATE; INTERHEMISPHERIC CONNECTIVITY; EEG COHERENCE; BAND POWER; REM-SLEEP; CHILDREN; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; METHODOLOGY	Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are thought to be associated with abnormal neural connectivity. Presently, neural connectivity is a theoretical construct that cannot be easily measured. Research in network science and time series analysis suggests that neural network structure, a marker of neural activity, can be measured with electroencephalography (EEG). EEG can be quantified by different methods of analysis to potentially detect brain abnormalities. The aim of this review is to examine evidence for the utility of three methods of EEG signal analysis in the ASD diagnosis and subtype delineation. We conducted a review of literature in which 40 studies were identified and classified according to the principal method of EEG analysis in three categories: functional connectivity analysis, spectral power analysis, and information dynamics. All studies identified significant differences between ASD patients and non-ASD subjects. However, due to high heterogeneity in the results, generalizations could not be inferred and none of the methods alone are currently useful as a new diagnostic tool. The lack of studies prevented the analysis of these methods as tools for ASD subtypes delineation. These results confirm EEG abnormalities in ASD, but as yet not sufficient to help in the diagnosis. Future research with larger samples and more robust study designs could allow for higher sensitivity and consistency in characterizing ASD, paving the way for developing new means of diagnosis.

Based on recently published work in the field of psychology, the proposed persuasive model depicts real-time electricity consumption information in the dynamically changing state or reaction of a virtual object, such as a digital pet, which is visually presented to users on a display device. Users interact with the virtual object, resulting in the promotion of behavior attuned towards energy conservation by influencing emotional or rational thinking. The interactive virtual object implemented in this study is a digital aquarium, which depicts a dynamic ecosystem that changes its visualization according to information from an electricity monitoring system. The visual presentation of the digital aquarium was designed based on the findings of studies into behavioral models. The prototype system was applied in two graduate student offices, where the study was run. Experimental results were analyzed to verify the persuasive effect of the proposed model. In addition, a questionnaire survey was conducted to probe user experiences and opinions regarding the prototype system. Results indicate the proposed model to be an effective approach to promoting and realizing electricity conservation objectives. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

METHHODS A total of 24 students participated in thinkaloud cognitive interviews, voicing their thoughts while completing a typical evaluation instrument that included items on overall course design, educational materials and methods, and faculty teaching. Students' responses were organised to consider how they interpreted questions, formed judgements and selected response options. Major themes relevant to the meaningful interpretation of course evaluation data were identified. RESULTS Medical students understood educational terms such as 'independent learning' in different ways from both one another and common usage. When formulating responses, students' judgements were sometimes based on unique or unexpected criteria, and they described editing their judgements by considering factors such as effort or caring on the part of teaching faculty. Students tended to avoid using the lower end of the rating scale, used the highest rating option selectively, but chose the second highest category indiscriminately. CONCLUSIONS These results call into question fundamental assumptions that frequently underlie interpretation of course evaluation results, such as whether students understand the intended meanings of terms used in items; whether faculty members who receive the same rating are perceived similarly; whether ratings actually reflect teaching effectiveness, and whether 'positive' ratings reflect positive opinions. This study also demonstrates how thinkaloud interviews can be used in validity studies, providing information to supplement statistical and psychometric analyses.

Collaboration and partnerships between organisations operating in the same system can assist, however, there is a paucity of research into how relationships function at a local level. The aim of this study was to audit initiatives, explore networks, and identify potential opportunities for improving the obesity prevention system in a Health Service area of Western Australia (WA). Methods A mixed-methods study was undertaken in a metropolitan Health Service in Perth, WA in 2019-20. Structured face-to-face interviews (n = 51) were conducted with organisations engaged in obesity prevention, to identify prevention initiatives and their characteristics using a Systems Inventory tool. The Research Team identified the 30 most active organisations during the Systems Inventory, and an online Organisational Network Survey was administered to explore: relationships across six domains; partnership duration; frequency of interaction with other organisations; barriers to implementation; and key contributions to obesity prevention. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise barriers, contributions and Systems Inventory data. Organisational Network Survey data were analysed using social network analysis through UCINET 6 for Windows and Netdraw software. Whole network and cohesion scores were calculated: average degree; density; diameter; and degree centralization. Core-periphery analysis was conducted to identify densely connected core and sparsely connected periphery organisations. Results The Systems Inventory identified 189 unique prevention initiatives, mostly focusing on individual-level behaviour change. Fifty four percent (n = 15) of the Organisational Network Survey respondent organisations and most core organisations (67%, n = 8) were government. The information and knowledge sharing network had a density of 45% indicating a high level of information and knowledge exchange between organisations. The lowest densities were found within the receiving (3.3%), providing (5.5%) and sharing (5.6%) funding networks, suggesting that these formal relationships were the least established. Conclusion Applying a systems thinking lens to local obesity prevention revealed that initiatives conducted focused on individual-level behaviour change and that collaboration and communication between organisations focused on information sharing. Capturing the extent and nature of initiatives and the way partnerships operate to improve obesity prevention can help to identify opportunities to strengthen the networks.

Objective To design a Decision Guide to support people living with HIV in assessing contexts, risks and benefits of workplace disclosure in choosing whether or not, or to what extent, to disclose. In this report, we review the participatory design of a Decision Guide prototype and focus on its evaluation. Methods We began with stakeholder input through an environmental scan and community consultation that informed the development of an online Decision Guide prototype. To evaluate the comprehensiveness, acceptability and usability of the prototype, we used qualitative methodology involving individual interviews and the think-aloud technique. Interviews were transcribed and analysed qualitatively. Results Fourteen people, including people living with HIV and service providers, participated. We identified benefits of the Decision Guide related to comprehensiveness, acceptability and usability. Additional interview themes focused on disclosure concerns, mitigating risks associated with disclosure and additional considerations for the Decision Guide. Conclusions The Decision Guide was perceived to be acceptable, comprehensive and useful. The findings endorse the application of a socio-ecological perspective when designing decision support aids for complex social decisions. Patient or public contribution People with lived experience of HIV were involved in the prototype design phases as research team members. They, along with community leaders and service providers, also participated in a community forum and were key informants for the evaluation of the Workplace Disclosure Decision Guide prototype.

Considering digital resilience, we propose a web app based on Social Network Analysis (SNA) to provide an overview of potentially misleading vs. non-misleading content on Twitter, which can be explored by users and enable foundational learning. The latter aims at systematically identifying thematic patterns which may be associated with misleading information. Additionally, it entails reflecting on indicators of misleading tweets which are proposed to approach classification of tweets. Paying special attention to non-expert users of social media, we conducted a two-step Think Aloud study for evaluation. While participants valued the opportunity to generate new knowledge and the diversity of the application, qualities such as equality and rapidity may be further improved. However, learning effects outweighed individual costs as all users were able to shift focus onto relevant features, such as hashtags, while readily pointing out content characteristics. Our design artifact connects to learning-oriented interventions regarding the spread of misleading information and tackles information overload by a SNA-based plug-in.

Therefore, many applications are memory-bandwidth bound. With this motivation and the realization that traditional architectures (with all DRAM reachable only via bus) are insufficient to feed groups of modern processing units, vendors have introduced a variety of non-DDR 3D memory technologies (Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC),Wide I/O 2, High Bandwidth Memory (HBM)). These offer higher bandwidth and lower power by stacking DRAM chips on the processor or nearby on a silicon interposer. We will call these solutions "near-memory," and if user-addressable, "scratchpad." High-performance systems on the market now offer two levels of main memory: near-memory on package and traditional DRAM further away. In the near term we expect the latencies near-memory and DRAM to be similar. Thus, it is natural to think of near-memory as another module on the DRAM level of the memory hierarchy. Vendors are expected to offer modes in which the near memory is used as cache, but we believe that this will be inefficient. In this paper, we explore the design space for a user-controlled multi-level main memory. Our work identifies situations in which rewriting application kernels can provide significant performance gains when using near-memory. We present algorithms designed for two-level main memory, using divide and-conquer to partition computations and streaming to exploit data locality. We consider algorithms for the fundamental application of sorting and for the data analysis kernel k-means. Our algorithms asymptotically reduce memory-block transfers under certain architectural parameter settings. We use and extend Sandia National Laboratories' SST simulation capability to demonstrate the relationship between increased bandwidth and improved algorithmic performance. Memory access counts from simulations corroborate predicted performance improvements for our sorting algorithm. In contrast, the k-means algorithm is generally CPU bound and does not improve when using near-memory except under extreme conditions. These conditions require large instances that rule out SST simulation, but we demonstrate improvements by running on a customized machine with high and low bandwidth memory. These case studies in co-design serve as positive and cautionary templates, respectively, for the major task of optimizing the computational kernels of many fundamental applications for two-level main memory systems.

However, several practical, ethical, and technological challenges remain. Across Europe, Personal Health Data Space (PHDS) projects are under development aiming to establish patient-centered, interoperable data ecosystems balancing data access, control, and use for individual citizens to complement the research and commercial focus of the European Health Data Space provisions. The current study explores healthcare users' and health care professionals' perspectives on personalized genomic medicine and PHDS solutions, in casu the Personal Genetic Locker (PGL). A mixed-methods design was used, including surveys, interviews, and focus groups. Several meta-themes were generated from the data: (i) participants were interested in genomic information; (ii) participants valued data control, robust infrastructure, and sharing data with non-commercial stakeholders; (iii) autonomy was a central concern for all participants; (iv) institutional and interpersonal trust were highly significant for genomic medicine; and (v) participants encouraged the implementation of PHDSs since PHDSs were thought to promote the use of genomic data and enhance patients' control over their data. To conclude, we formulated several facilitators to implement genomic medicine in healthcare based on the perspectives of a diverse set of stakeholders.	[Tommel, Judith; Evers, Andrea W.

The art and practice of systems biology in medicine: Mapping patterns of relationships	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH			English	Article						systems biology; system thinking; proteomics; metabolomics; correlation networks	DIRECT CHEMICAL-IONIZATION; INTERPRETING CORRELATIONS; DRUG DISCOVERY; METABOLOMICS; PYROLYSIS; BACTERIA; PLASMA; IMPACT; NMR	Systems biology has developed in recent years from a technology-driven enterprise to a new strategic tool in Life Sciences, particularly for innovative drug discovery and drug development. Combining the ultimate in systems phenotyping with in-depth investigations of biomolecular mechanisms will enable a revolution in our understanding of disease pathology and will advance translational medicine, combination therapies, integrative medicine, and personalized medicine. A prerequisite for deriving the benefits of such a systems approach is a reliable and well-validated bioanalytical platform across complementary measurement modalities, especially transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, that operates in concert with a megavariate integrative biostatistical/bioinformatics platform. The applicable bioanalytical methodologies must undergo an intense development trajectory to reach an optimal level of reliable performance and quantitative reproducibility in daily practice. Moreover, to generate such enabling systems information, it is essential to design experiments based on an understanding of the complexity and statistical characteristics of the large data sets created. Novel insights into biology and system science can be obtained by evaluating the molecular connectivity within a system through correlation networks, by monitoring the dynamics of a system, or by measuring the system responses to perturbations such as drug administration or challenge tests. In addition, cross-compartment communication and control/feed-back mechanisms can be studied via correlation network analyses. All these data analyses depend critically upon the generation of high-quality bioanalytical platform data sets. The emphasis of this paper is on the characteristics of a bioanalytical platform that we have developed to generate such data sets. The broad applicability of Systems Biology in pharmaceutical research and development is discussed with examples in disease biomarker research, in pharmacology using system response monitoring, and in cross-compartment system toxicology assessment.

We propose a three-body framework of spatial typologies in the realm of collaborative room-centered immersive systems that governs the relationship between the immersants, the hardware system of the environment, and the presented virtual environment. Through the lens of this framework, we present several use cases in the Collaborative-Research Augmented Immersive Virtual Environment Laboratory (CRAIVE-Lab) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Through the narratives of these use cases, it is argued that the proposed framework not only affords the design of interaction systems in room-centered virtual environments with spatial awareness, but also engenders new approaches to envision system design and its integration to the built environment. This framework intends to emphasize the significance of spatial thinking in expanding the creative potentials of body-driven interactive immersive systems.

J	Hasson, N; Dodd, B; Botting, N				Hasson, Natalie; Dodd, Barbara; Botting, Nicola			Dynamic Assessment of Sentence Structure (DASS): design and evaluation of a novel procedure for the assessment of syntax in children with language impairments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION DISORDERS			English	Article						dynamic assessment; learning potential; sentence structure; language impairment	INFORMATION; ABILITY	Background: Sentence construction and syntactic organization are known to be poor in children with specific language impairments (SLI), but little is known about the way in which children with SLI approach language tasks, and static standardized tests contribute little to the differentiation of skills within the population of children with language impairments (LI). Information about the nature and intensity of prompts that facilitate sentence construction for a particular child may be useful in planning effective intervention. Aims: This paper describes the development of a dynamic assessment (DA) task which requires implicit knowledge of syntactic structure. The aim was to formulate a valid and reliable procedure for the DA of sentence formulation that could yield useful information for planning intervention for children with LI. Methods & Procedures: The Dynamic Assessment of Sentence Structure (DASS) was employed on 24 children aged 8-10 years, with identified language impairments, who were tested four times, at 4 monthly intervals. Outcomes & Results: A range of scores was elicited with no limiting ceiling or floor effects, and the test showed high internal reliability of alpha = 0.833. Inter-rater reliability was high. Concurrent validity was demonstrated by significant correlation with scores obtained on the CELF-3(UK) and predictive validity of the measure was also found to exceed that of the standardized test measure. Information about the ability of the children to use strategies and less directive prompts, and to transfer learning between items was elicited, and the information was thought to be useful by speech and language therapists involved in their management. Conclusions & Implications: The application of DA principles to the assessment of children previously diagnosed with LI, for the purposes of finding out more information about their potential to benefit from language intervention, was found to be effective. The tool developed was shown to be valid and reliable, and it has potentially important applications for the planning of individual intervention programmes and service delivery.

Little research has explored the application of prospect theory based framing tactics (described in the text) to advertising. In this research we empirically test three framing tactics simultaneously, to study their individual main effects, and the interaction effects among them. We also test the moderating effect of buyers' prior knowledge of the product category. We used a fractional factorial experimental design to study purchase Likelihood as a function of the above framing tactics, using 216 women, ages 25 to 49, who owned or were thinking of buying a video Camera. Some of the most interesting results involved significant two-way interaction effects. As expected, subjects responded differently, depending on their level of product category knowledge. One framing tactic was more influential on high knowledge subjects than on low or moderate knowledge subjects. Other interactions among the several framing tactics yielded significant and interesting results. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Acceptability of a 'guidebook' for the management of Osteoarthritis: a qualitative study of patient and clinician's perspectives	BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Osteoarthritis; Self-management; Written information; Clinical guidelines; Qualitative; Health care professionals; Patients	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; SELF-MANAGEMENT; PRIMARY-CARE; INFORMATION; EDUCATION; BOOKLET; VIEWS; HIP	Background: Written information can be of benefit to both practitioners and patients and the provision of quality information is emphasised as a core intervention by United Kingdom National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) OA guidelines. Researchers, patients and HCPs developed an 'OA guidebook' to provide; a) a balanced source of information for patients; b) a resource to aid practitioners when discussing self-management. This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability and usefulness of the OA guidebook as part of complex intervention to deliver NICE OA guidelines in General Practice. Methods: The intervention comprises a series of consultations with GPs and practice nurses in which supported self-management is offered to patients. Eight practices in the West Midlands and North West of England were recruited to take part: four control practices and four intervention practices. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with patients (n = 29), GPs (n = 9) and practice nurses (n = 4) from the intervention practices to explore experiences of the intervention and use of the guidebook. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and constant comparison of data within and across interviews. Results: GPs thought the guidebook helped provide patients with information about OA aetiology, prognosis and self-management. Thus, it backed up key messages they provided patients during consultations. GPs also found the guidebook helped them 'close off' consultations. Nurses also thought the guidebook helped them describe OA disease processes in consultations. Patients valued the explanations of disease onset, process and prognosis. The use of 'real' people and 'real life' situations contained within the guidebook made self-management strategies seem more tangible. A sense of inclusion and comfort was obtained from knowing other people encountered similar problems and feelings. Conclusion: An OA specific written information guidebook was deemed acceptable and useful to practitioners and patients alike as part of the MOSAICS study. Findings reinforce the utility of this model of patient information as a resource to support patients living with chronic illnesses. An OA guidebook featuring a mixture of lay and professional information developed by professionals and lay people is useful and could effectively be used more widely in usual care.

J	Park, K; Farb, A; George, B				Park, Keunhyun; Farb, Anna; George, Benjamin			Effectiveness of visual communication and collaboration tools for online GIS teaching: using Padlet and Conceptboard	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Virtual collaboration; design education; pedagogy; problem-based learning	DESIGN STUDIO; DISCUSSIONS; EDUCATION; LEARNERS	Geographic information systems (GIS) have become more suitable for online delivery. But teaching GIS online is challenging because, without enough interactions with the instructor or among themselves, students may not understand processes, use critical thinking, and collaborate effectively on a team project. This study aims to evaluate two online visual collaboration tools, Padlet and Conceptboard, in enhancing learner engagement, collaboration, and visual communication in an online GIS course. We analyze 1) usage patterns and their relationship with student performance, 2) students' opinions on the added values of the tools compared with face-to-face delivery, and 3) students' qualitative feedback. Student findings show that those tools, particularly Conceptboard, help students get timely help from other students and the instructors, be motivated by participating in discussions and seeing others' progress, organize and brainstorm project ideas, and summarize and present the final products. The combination of Conceptboard and an online video conference tool is a particularly effective alternative to the face-to-face learning environment. On the other hand, we also found significant challenges with remote teamwork in GIS. The course design incorporating online collaboration tools can provide practical strategies to instructors who teach GIS or similar software online.

Here, we identified the novel role of autolysin Atl in penetration of the respiratory barrier by SS2 and its systemic dissemination and identified its binding partner, vimentin, a type III intermediate filament protein. Atl contributed to the MLCK-triggered redistribution of tight junctions to open the tracheal epithelial barrier. Knockout of vimentin abolished the ability of SS2 to penetrate the monolayer barrier and the activation of MLCK. Furthermore, vimentin null mice were protected from infection by intranasally administered SS2. This study is the first to demonstrate that the interaction between the GBS Bsp-like domain of Atl and vimentin promotes MLCK-mediated dysfunction of the epithelial barrier, which may provide theoretical information for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments against diseases caused by similar respiratory pathogens. Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a major zoonotic pathogen resulting in manifestations as pneumonia and septic shock. The upper respiratory tract is typically thought to be the main colonization and entry site of SS2 in pigs, but the mechanism through which it penetrates the respiratory barrier is still unclear. In this study, a mutant with low invasive potential to swine tracheal epithelial cells (STECs) was screened from the TnYLB-1 transposon insertion mutant library of SS2, and the interrupted gene was identified as autolysin (atl). Compared to wild-type (WT) SS2, Delta atl mutant exhibited lower ability to penetrate the tracheal epithelial barrier in a mouse model. Purified Atl also enhanced SS2 translocation across STEC monolayers in Transwell inserts. Furthermore, Atl redistributed the tight junctions (TJs) in STECs through myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) signaling, which led to increased barrier permeability. Using mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), pull-down, bacterial two-hybrid and saturation binding experiments, we showed that Atl binds directly to vimentin. CRISPR/Cas9-targeted deletion of vimentin in STECs (VIM KO STECs) abrogated the capacity of SS2 to translocate across the monolayers, SS2-induced phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC) and MLCK transcription, indicating that vimentin is indispensable for MLCK activation. Consistently, vimentin null mice were protected from SS2 infection and exhibited reduced tracheal and lung injury. Thus, MLCK-mediated epithelial barrier opening caused by the Atl-vimentin interaction is found to be likely the key mechanism by which SS2 penetrates the tracheal epithelium.

It is argued that vulnerability coping is a matter of ethics and art: it requires developing a kind of art and techne in the sense that it always involves technologies and specific styles of experiencing and dealing with vulnerability, which depend on social and cultural context. It is suggested that we try to find better, perhaps less modern styles of coping with our vulnerability, recognize limits to our attempts to "design" our new forms, and explore what kinds of technologies we need for this project.

A descriptive qualitative design, using semi-structured open-ended questions, was employed to information about the choices culturally diverse student nurses made in the care of adult patients in a variety of clinical settings. knowing, heroism, anxiety and frustration were the emerging themes. The findings indicate that students used mutual goal setting throughout the decision-making process. The author applied King's theory of goal attainment to interpret the findings of the study and to link theory to practice. Clinical decision-making is an topic in nursing education and practice. Faculty understanding of thought processes precedes the design of specific to enhance clinical reasoning. Helping students to advance from reliance on memorization of textbook information to the application concepts from the liberal arts and from biological and nursing science is part of that process. This is a special challenge for nursing and staff educators who teach nursing students and new graduates from diverse experiential and educational backgrounds. Numerous clinical decision-making studies offer conflicting and inconclusive findings concerning predictive outcomes and factors. This investigator chose to study the decision-making phenomenon from a holistic point of view, using a qualitative As opposed to focusing solely on the outcome of clinical choices, the aim of the study was to gain a clearer understanding of the ways which student nurses make clinical decisions.

The effect of human-computer interaction (HCI) also plays a leading role in human error. The objective of this study is to propose a method of interaction strategies based on a cognitive-processing model in crews' daily navigation tasks. A knowledge-based ship HCI framework architecture is established. It provides an extensible framework for the HCI process in the maritime domain. By focusing on the cognitive process of a crew in the context of accident and risk handling during ship navigation, based on the information, decision, and action in crew context (IDAC) model, in combination with the maritime accident dynamics simulation (MADS) system, the MADS-IDAC system was developed and enhanced by the HCI structure and function design of the dynamic risk analysis platform for maritime management. The results indicate that MADS enhanced by HCI can effectively generate a strategy set of various outcomes in preset scenarios. Moreover, it provides a new method and thought for avoiding human error in crew interaction and to lower the risk of ship collision as well as effectively improving the reliability of HCI.

J	SINGER, JL				SINGER, JL			EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF ONGOING CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE	CIBA FOUNDATION SYMPOSIA			English	Article							PERSONALITY	A research programme designed to find ways of applying a variety of methods in psychological science to studying the seemingly ephemeral phenomena of the human stream of consciousness and its manifestations in daydreams, interior monologues, imagery and related private experiences is described. Approaches include psychometric studies to establish normative information on daydreaming and experimental studies using signal-detection paradigms to capture the ongoing stream of thought. Recent experiments involve thought-sampling methods for identifying the determinants of the content of the stream of thought in adolescents or the ways in which self-beliefs and emotions are manifested in a group of cocaine and heroin abusers. Children's pretend play is studied as a possible forerunner of adult consciousness. It is proposed that the human condition involves a continuing tension between processing information generated from the physical and social milieu and the continuous operation of centrally generated material from long-term memory in the form of reminiscences, wishes, current concerns, expectancies and fantasies. This concept has implications for personality variation. affective arousal and adaptive behaviour.

The program aimed to reduce parents' symptoms of general and posttraumatic stress. Methods: Participants were parents of children treated for burns between 2009-2013 at either of the two specialized Swedish Burn centers. Sixty-two parents were included in a two-armed, randomized controlled trial with a six-week intervention group and a wait list control group, including a pre and post-assessment, as well as a 3 and 12-month follow-up. The intervention contained psychoeducation, exercises and homework assignments, and the intervention group received weekly written feedback from a therapist. The main outcome was stress (post-traumatic stress, general stress and parental stress). Results: The program had a beneficial effect on posttraumatic stress in the short term, but did not affect general stress or parental stress. The parents rated the program as being informative and meaningful, but some of them thought it was time-consuming. Conclusion: The program has the potential to support parents of children with burns. The intervention is easily accessible, cost-effective and could be implemented in bum care rehabilitation. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Several information-theoretical methods have been proposed to assess the relevance of individual response features, as for example, the spike count of a given neuron, or the amount of correlation in the activity of two cells. These methods work under the premise that the relevance of a feature is reflected in the information loss that is induced by eliminating the feature from the response. The alternative methods differ in the procedure by which the tested feature is removed, and the algorithm with which the lost information is calculated. Here we compare these methods, and show that more often than not, each method assigns a different relevance to the tested feature. We demonstrate that the differences are both quantitative and qualitative, and connect them with the method employed to remove the tested feature, as well as the procedure to calculate the lost information. By studying a collection of carefully designed examples, and working on analytic derivations, we identify the conditions under which the relevance of features diagnosed by different methods can be ranked, or sometimes even equated. The condition for equality involves both the amount and the type of information contributed by the tested feature. We conclude that the quest for relevant response features is more delicate than previously thought, and may yield to multiple answers depending on methodological subtleties.

It appears that receptors and transporters bind to Glu in different conformations, which may present a pharmacological opportunity. This review will compare and contrast information available on Glu Receptors (AMPA, NMDA, KA and mGlu), excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), the system Xc- transporter (XCT) and the vesicular Glutamate transporter (GVT). The cross-reactivity of ligands which have been previously used to characterize the glutamate binding proteins with system Xc- raises some fundamental interpretational issues regarding the mechanisms through which these analogues produce CNS damage. Although at one time it was thought that unraveling selectivity among glutamate binding proteins was an intractable problem, recently the NMDA antagonist (memantine) has been approved for general medical practice for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Two other agents are in advanced clinical trials: an Ampakine for potential improvement of cognitive disorders, and a selective mGlu agonist for treatment of anxiety. The prospects for unraveling cross-reactivity will be weighed in light of a critical comparison of the glutamate binding protein targets.

They describe their discussions of antenatal counselling from health care professionals as focusing too much on the nature of the anomaly involving unintelligible medical terminology, when what they really want is a picture of the best- and worst-case scenarios. Whilst information on the level of risk for their fetus is important, it is not the parents' primary concern. When statistics for risk are given, they may not be as well understood as the health care professionals think. This review discusses the published evidence on antenatal counselling and recommendations for explaining risk to parents of fetuses with neurological anomalies. From this data we make recommendations for the organization of antenatal counselling services.

This article reports our experiences with two iterations of the first large online class to use peer and self-assessment. In this class, peer grades correlated highly with staff-assigned grades. The second iteration had 42.9% of students' grades within 5% of the staff grade, and 65.5% within 10%. On average, students assessed their work 7% higher than staff did. Students also rated peers' work from their own country 3.6% higher than those from elsewhere. We performed three experiments to improve grading accuracy. We found that giving students feedback about their grading bias increased subsequent accuracy. We introduce short, customizable feedback snippets that cover common issues with assignments, providing students more qualitative peer feedback. Finally, we introduce a data-driven approach that highlights high-variance items for improvement. We find that rubrics that use a parallel sentence structure, unambiguous wording, and well-specified dimensions have lower variance. After revising rubrics, median grading error decreased from 12.4% to 9.9%.

Rather than focusing on the manager's information need on "critical success factors" and the need for supporting specific decision making, this research emphasizes the need to support the decision maker's general thinking processes to reduce cognitive biases in decision making.

Methods for managing and locating FA information must be developed if we are to continue to be effective in solving problems that occur during design, fab, packaging, and field use. To this end, Sandia National Laboratories has developed a computer-based training tool for FA known as FASTAdvice. FASTAdvice is a hypertext-based, multimedia tool that simulates the thinking process of a number of failure analysis experts and contains a substantial portion of the knowledge necessary to successfully perform FA.

Can an educational podcast improve the ability of parents of primary school children to assess the reliability of claims made about the benefits and harms of treatments: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial	TRIALS			English	Article						Critical thinking; Critical appraisal; Higher order thinking; Meta cognition; Treatment claims; Health literacy; Evidence-based health care; EBM teaching resources; Primary school curriculum; Science teaching	EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE; LOW HEALTH LITERACY; NEWS MEDIA; PREVALENCE; COVERAGE; BARRIER	Background: Claims made about the effects of treatments are very common in the media and in the population more generally. The ability of individuals to understand and assess such claims can affect their decisions and health outcomes. Many people in both low-and high-income countries have inadequate aptitude to assess information about the effects of treatments. As part of the Informed Healthcare Choices project, we have prepared a series of podcast episodes to help improve people's ability to assess claims made about treatment effects. We will evaluate the effect of the Informed Healthcare Choices podcast on people's ability to assess claims made about the benefits and harms of treatments. Our study population will be parents of primary school children in schools with limited educational and financial resources in Uganda. Methods: This will be a two-arm, parallel-group, individual-randomised trial. We will randomly allocate consenting participants who meet the inclusion criteria for the trial to either listen to nine episodes of the Informed Healthcare Choices podcast (intervention) or to listen to nine typical public service announcements about health issues (control). Each podcast includes a story about a treatment claim, a message about one key concept that we believe is important for people to be able to understand to assess treatment claims, an explanation of how that concept applies to the claim, and a second example illustrating the concept. We designed the Claim Evaluation Tools to measure people's ability to apply key concepts related to assessing claims made about the effects of treatments and making informed health care choices. The Claim Evaluation Tools that we will use include multiple-choice questions addressing each of the nine concepts covered by the podcast. Using the Claim Evaluation Tools, we will measure two primary outcomes: (1) the proportion that 'pass', based on an absolute standard and (2) the average score. Discussion: As far as we are aware this is the first randomised trial to assess the use of mass media to promote understanding of the key concepts needed to judge claims made about the effects of treatments.

Although sediment fingerprinting has been applied with reasonable success, the deployment of this method remains associated with many issues and limitations. Methods Seminars and debates were organised during a 4-day Thematic School in October 2021 to come up with concrete suggestions to improve the design and implementation of tracing methods. Results First, we suggest a better use of geomorphological information to improve study design. Researchers are invited to scrutinise all the knowledge available on the catchment of interest, and to obtain multiple lines of evidence regarding sediment source contributions. Second, we think that scientific knowledge could be improved with local knowledge and we propose a scale of participation describing different levels of involvement of locals in research. Third, we recommend the use of state-of-the-art sediment tracing protocols to conduct sampling, deal with particle size, and examine data before modelling and accounting for the hydro-meteorological context under investigation. Fourth, we promote best practices in modelling, including the importance of running multiple models, selecting appropriate tracers, and reporting on model errors and uncertainty. Fifth, we suggest best practices to share tracing data and samples, which will increase the visibility of the fingerprinting technique in geoscience. Sixth, we suggest that a better formulation of hypotheses could improve our knowledge about erosion and sediment transport processes in a more unified way. Conclusion With the suggested improvements, sediment fingerprinting, which is interdisciplinary in nature, could play a major role to meet the current and future challenges associated with global change.

However, these criticisms have yet to be tested empirically across a range of geographical environments and institutions. We surveyed 243 protected area staff from 55 countries to describe how M&E is undertaken and to identify variables statistically associated with effective M&E. We found that M&E is routinely employed: 78% of respondents indicated that monitoring occurred and 64% responded that monitoring persisted for at least as long that a management action was implemented. However, our results suggested there is scope to improve the way that M&E is conducted: only 46% of respondents thought that M&E worked well, just 36% provided an example of monitoring informing management and 38% of respondents indicated that management is not undertaken in different ways to facilitate adaptive management. Monitoring and evaluation was generally perceived to be working better in non-government organisations (NGOs), where data are entered in existing databases, and where research and management staff work cooperatively. Monitoring had a greater probability of informing management where documented thresholds were in place that trigger management intervention and where monitoring data were stored in a publicly available database. Management was most likely to be implemented in different ways to facilitate adaptive management in NGOs, where management intervention options were documented, monitoring had persisted as long as the management action and where reporting is done regularly. The most common suggestions that respondents gave to improve M&E were increased funding, better science management integration, and improving organisational culture and commitment.

Methods The sociotechnical systems framework was used to investigate the e-prescribing technology interface in community pharmacies by taking into consideration the social, technical and environmental work elements of a user's interaction with technology. This study focused specifically on aspects of the social subsystem. Study design and setting The study employed a cross-sectional qualitative design and was conducted in seven community pharmacies in Wisconsin. Direct observations, think aloud protocols and group interviews were conducted with 14 pharmacists and 16 technicians, and audio recorded. Recordings were transcribed and subjected to thematic content analysis guided by the sociotechnical systems' theoretical framework. Results Three major themes that may increase the potential for medication errors with e-prescribing were identified and described. The three themes included: (1) increased cognitive burden on pharmacy staff, such as having to memorise parts of e-prescriptions or having to perform dosage calculations mentally; (2) interruptions during the e-prescription dispensing process; and (3) communication issues with prescribers, patients and among pharmacy staff. Pharmacy staff reported these consequences of e-prescribing increased the likelihood of medication errors. Conclusions This study is the first of its kind to identify patient safety risks related to e-prescribing in community pharmacies using a sociotechnical systems framework. The findings shed light on potential interventions that may enhance patient safety in pharmacies and facilitate improved e-prescribing use. Future studies should confirm patient safety hazards reported and identify ways to use e-prescribing effectively and safely in community pharmacies.

In order to develop a guideline-based decision support system (DSS) prototype to help clinicians deal with diabetic patients' foot problems, we drew on methodologies from qualitative research, cognitive science, and information systems. This multi-perspective approach was intended to facilitate user-centered design and evaluation. Methods: We employed field observations, structured interviews, and document analyses to collect and analyze users' workflow patterns, decision support goals, and preferences regarding interactions with a DSS. Next, we aligned their requirements with sequence diagrams and followed Nielsen's heuristics to develop a DSS prototype. We then performed think-aloud analyses and used the technology acceptance model to direct our evaluation of users' perceptions of the prototype. Results: Users had a positive response to the DSS prototype in terms of its clarity of design and ease of use. They expressed a high intention of using the system in the future. Conclusion: Applying multi-perspective methodologies is an effective way to study and design user interactions with the front end of a guideline-based DSS. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Memantine Effects on Electroencephalographic Measures of Putative Excitatory/Inhibitory Balance in Schizophrenia	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY-COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						Cognition; Early auditory information processing; Electroencephalography; Excitation/inhibition balance; Memantine; Schizophrenia	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; EXCITATION/INHIBITION BALANCE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DEFICITS; EXCITATION; COGNITION; CONNECTIVITY; DYSFUNCTION; IMPAIRMENT	BACKGROUND: Abnormalities in cortical excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance are thought to underlie sensory and information processing deficits in schizophrenia. Deficits in early auditory information processing mediate both neurocognitive and functional impairment and appear to be normalized by acute pharmacologic challenge with the NMDA antagonist memantine (MEM). METHODS: Thirty-six subjects with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 31 healthy control subjects underwent electroencephalographic recordings. Subjects ingested either placebo or MEM (10 or 20 mg) in a double-blind, within-subject, crossover, randomized design. The aperiodic, 1/f-like scaling property of the neural power spectra, which is thought to index relative E/I balance, was estimated using a robust linear regression algorithm. RESULTS: Patients with schizophrenia had greater aperiodic components compared with healthy control subjects (p<.01, d = 0.64), which was normalized after 20 mg MEM. Analysis revealed a significant dose 3 diagnosis interaction (p<.0001, d = 0.82). Furthermore, the MEM effect (change in aperiodic component in MEM vs. placebo conditions) was associated with baseline attention and vigilance (r =.54, p<.05) and MEM-induced enhancements in gamma power (r = 2.60, p<.01). CONCLUSIONS: Findings confirmed E/I balance abnormalities in schizophrenia that were normalized with acute MEM administration and suggest that neurocognitive profiles may predict treatment response based on E/I sensitivity. These data provide proof-of-concept evidence for the utility of E/I balance indices as metrics of acute pharmacologic sensitivity for central nervous system therapeutics.

What should a website dedicated to the postnatal period contain? A Delphi survey among parents and professionals	MIDWIFERY			English	Article						Mothers; Website development; Delphi survey; Postnatal period; Need for information	WEB-BASED SURVEY; INTERNET USE; CHILDBIRTH; EXPERIENCES; INFORMATION; NEEDS; PREVALENCE; POSTPARTUM; DISCHARGE; MOTHERS	Objectives: Mothers have a great need for information during the postnatal period. Trying to meet this need, mothers are increasingly turning to the Internet. Nevertheless, many women have stated that they often or always found that the information that they found on the Internet was incomplete or wrong. Many women therefore believe that health professionals should suggest reliable Internet websites for new mothers. The aim of this study was therefore to find a consensus on the content of a reliable and centralized website dedicated to mothers from the end of pregnancy to 1 year after childbirth. Design: Two rounds of an online Delphi survey were used in this study. Setting and participants: The panel of participants involved in the survey included parents (both mothers and fathers) and professionals (health professionals and professionals of early childhood for mothers of children aged 0 to 2 years). Findings: Ninety-six parents and professionals participated in the first round (37.7 +/- 9.76 years; 84.4% of women) and 78 in the second round. The majority of participants (94.6%) thought that a centralized website could help mothers from pregnancy to one year after childbirth. The content that the experts would like to find on a website were themed into five categories: "infants' information", "parents' information", "administrative information", "professionals' information" and "type of resources". In each category, experts highlighted the key words that they found important and should be reported on the website. The most important items highlighted by participants were baby's feeding/breastfeeding (92.8%), babies' needs (84.1%), baby blues (77.9%), postpartum depression (72.1%), management of the couple's relationship (72.1%), women's right to postnatal care (83.6%), links to reliable documents (63.9%) and a list of useful contacts (52.5%). Conclusions: This study helped to understand the questions that mothers ask themselves during the postpartum period and provided priorities to respond to their questions in the process of developing a website.

OBSERVATIONS ABOUT HOW WE LEARN ABOUT METHODOLOGY AND STATISTICS	MONOGRAPHS OF THE SOCIETY FOR RESEARCH IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT			English	Editorial Material								The overarching theme of this monograph is to encourage developmental researchers to acquire cutting-edge and innovative design and statistical methods so that we can improve the studies that we execute on the topic of change. Card, the editor of the monograph, challenges the reader to think about works such as the present one as contributing to the new subdiscipline of developmental methodology within the broader field of developmental science. This thought-provoking stance served as the stimulus for the present commentary, which is a collection of observations on how we learn about methodology and statistics. The point is made that we often learn critical new information from our colleagues, from seminal writings in the literature, and from conferences and workshop participation. It is encouraged that researchers pursue all three of these pathways as ways to acquire innovative knowledge and techniques. Finally, the role of developmental science societies in supporting the dissemination and uptake of this type of knowledge is discussed.

J	Charkova, DA; Somova, E				Charkova, Denitza Anguelova; Somova, Elena			The role of sustainable development in the academic curriculum and prospective employment: a survey of information technology students in Bulgaria	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Education for sustainable development; Pro-sustainability attitudes and actions; University students; Prospective employers	HIGHER-EDUCATION; ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY	PurposeThe information technology (IT) sector is a powerful factor in present-day society, and its role in pro-sustainability policies is crucial. This study aims to gain insight into IT students' perspectives on the role of education for sustainable development (ESD) in their academic curriculum as well as to project their attitudes and actions to prospective employers. Design/methodology/approachThis study used a cross-sectional survey design, involving 260 students majoring in IT at a public university in Bulgaria. FindingsThe majority of the students (67.30%) believed that their university education should promote students' social and environmental skills. However, 55-65% thought that the current academic curriculum failed to connect subject matter with relevant environmental issues. The students held high expectations of prospective employers. There was a significant concordance between the participants' views on sustainability and their perceived workplace actions. The participants who believed that employers should reduce carbon emissions were significantly more likely to refuse to do any work that supports the fossil fuel industry [odds ratio (OR) = 4.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.04-11.37] or leave a job if the company provides products or services for the fossil fuel industry (OR = 3.10, 95% CI: 1.26-7.26). Such participants were more likely to opt for a lower salary in favor of environmental principles (OR = 2.38, 95% CI: 1.32-4.28). Social implicationsThe IT sector is a powerful factor in present-day society, and its role in pro-sustainability policies is crucial. IT students' perspectives on the gaps in current sustainability practices convey a message to the IT academic and employment communities that environmental issues matter and are important to this new generation of technologically savvy people. Originality/valueThere have been a few other studies in Bulgaria on the issue of ESD, but no other study has focused on the projection of students' attitudes toward the environment onto future employers. The study's results showed that the Bulgarian young people who were getting ready for jobs in the IT field had the same environmental values and concerns as their peers from different higher education areas in different parts of the world. They were interested in acquiring knowledge and competencies that would help propel pro-environmental actions in their academic institution and future workplace. Notwithstanding the overall low economic standards in their country, they tended to put carbon-free and environmentally friendly policies ahead of financial interests. Their critical perspectives on the gaps in current sustainability practices convey a message to the academic and job communities in IT that environmental issues matter to this new generation of technologically savvy people.

J	Chien, YC; Liu, MC; Wu, TT				Chien, Yu-Cheng; Liu, Ming-Chi; Wu, Ting-Ting			Discussion-record-based prediction model for creativity education using clustering methods	THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY			English	Article						Creativity; Data mining; Project-based learning; Engineering education; Cluster analysis	LEARNING ANALYTICS; STUDENT CREATIVITY; TEAM CREATIVITY; INNOVATION; THINKING; COMMUNICATION; QUESTIONNAIRE; ENVIRONMENTS; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT	The development of creativity is a major challenge for engineering education. Creativity not only affects originality and innovation but also increases the utility of products and ideas, thus yielding a competitive advantage in the market. Although studies have demonstrated that creativity can be practically assessed through student innovation or responses to creativity questionnaires, few studies have explored how creativity is developed. Therefore, this study developed a model for predicting creativity based on the discussion records of students during creative activities. The model was designed using the Chinese Knowledge Information Processing tokenization system, a term frequency-inverse document frequency method, and support vector machines. The experimental results revealed a model accuracy of 93 %, thus demonstrating the model's feasibility for predicting creativity. Furthermore, the students' key terms were obtained by using k-means clustering with the proposed model, thus yielding valuable supplementary information for exploring the development of creative ideas. These results revealed that data mining has substantial value in creativity education. Therefore, the proposed predictive model is suitable for predicting creativity in learning activities based on discussion records. It can support teachers' assessment of student performance and provision of timely guidance and feedback to enhance creative thinking and stimulate imagination among engineering students.

This provides the ability to quickly explore the architectural design space and tradeoffs between resource utilization and performance. Unfortunately, security evaluation is not a standard part of the HLS design flow. In this article, we aim to understand the effects of memory-based HLS optimizations on power side-channel leakage. We use Xilinx Vivado HLS to develop different cryptographic cores, implement them on a Spartan-6 FPGA, and collect power traces. We evaluate the designs with respect to resource utilization, performance, and information leakage through power consumption. We have two important observations and contributions. First, the choice of resource optimization directive results in different levels of side-channel vulnerabilities. Second, the partitioning optimization directive can greatly compromise the hardware cryptographic system through power side-channel leakage due to the deployment of memory control logic. We describe an evaluation procedure for power side-channel leakage and use it to make best-effort recommendations about how to design more secure architectures in the cryptographic domain.

J	Swanson, EB				Swanson, EB			Maintaining IS quality	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						quality; IS quality; IS maintenance	SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE	Information systems quality is most commonly thought of as achieved primarily from a system's original design and development. In fact, it is achieved substantially from the system's subsequent maintenance after being entered into production. IS maintenance is, in other words, fundamentally an activity of quality achievement and maintenance. The term 'quality' II lay be associated with four definitions: quality is excellence, quality is value, quality is conformance to specifications and quality is meeting and/or exceeding customer's expectations. IS maintenance is basic to achieving quality in each definitional case. We explain why, drawing from our own empirical research as well as that of others. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Baccini, A; Barabesi, L; De Nicolao, G				Baccini, Alberto; Barabesi, Lucio; De Nicolao, Giuseppe			On the agreement between bibliometrics and peer review: Evidence from the Italian research assessment exercises	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVALUATING SCIENTIFIC-RESEARCH; KAPPA	This paper analyzes the concordance between bibliometrics and peer review. It draws evidence from the data of two experiments of the Italian governmental agency for research evaluation. The experiments were performed by the agency for validating the adoption in the Italian research assessment exercises of a dual system of evaluation, where some outputs were evaluated by bibliometrics and others by peer review. The two experiments were based on stratified random samples of journal articles. Each article was scored by bibliometrics and by peer review. The degree of concordance between the two evaluations is then computed. The correct setting of the experiments is defined by developing the design-based estimation of the Cohen's kappa coefficient and some testing procedures for assessing the homogeneity of missing proportions between strata. The results of both experiments show that for each research areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics the degree of agreement between bibliometrics and peer review is-at most-weak at an individual article level. Thus, the outcome of the experiments does not validate the use of the dual system of evaluation in the Italian research assessments. More in general, the very weak concordance indicates that metrics should not replace peer review at the level of individual article. Hence, the use of the dual system in a research assessment might worsen the quality of information compared to the adoption of peer review only or bibliometrics only.

The Growing Role of Electron Microscopy in Anti-parasitic Drug Discovery	CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Review						Electron microscopy; structure based drug design; Plasmodium falciparum; parasitic disease	CRYO-EM STRUCTURE; CRYOELECTRON MICROSCOPY; STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY; ATP SYNTHASE; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; ATOMIC-STRUCTURE; IN-SITU; PLASMODIUM; COMPLEX; DESIGN	Background: Parasite diseases are a huge burden on human health causing significant morbidity and mortality. However, parasite structure based drug discovery programmes have been hindered by a lack of high resolution structural information from parasite derived proteins and have often relied upon homology models from mammalian systems. The recent renaissance in electron microscopy (EM) has caused a dramatic rise in the number of structures being determined at high resolution and subsequently enabled it to be thought of as a tool in drug discovery. Results: In this review, we discuss the challenges associated with the structural determination of parasite proteins including the difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of protein. We then discuss the reasons behind the resurgence in EM, how it may overcome some of these challenges and provide examples of EM derived parasite protein structures. Finally, we discuss the challenges which EM needs to overcome before it is used as a mainstream technique in anti-parasite drug discovery. Conclusions: This review reports the progress that has been made in obtaining sufficient quantities of proteins for structural studies and the role EM may play in future structure based drug design programs. The outlook for future structure based drug design programs against some of the most devastating parasite diseases looks promising.	[Johnson, R. M.; Rawson, S.; Muench, S.

For this reason, many have focused on integrating life cycle thinking into occupational risk assessment. The resultant methods have different properties in terms of scope and outcomes. Literature has been reviewed for life cycle occupational risk assessment methodologies, and 3 methods (life cycle inherent toxicity (LCIT) method, work environment characterization factors (WE-CFs) method, and life cycle risk assessment (LCRA) method) have been selected and applied in a case study of electricity production from pyro-oil to identify suitability and research gaps in the existing literature. The results of the LCIT method were highly heterogenous over life cycle of electricity production. For the current case, the major cancer and non-cancer impacts originated from the same life cycles. The results from WE-CFs method were highly heterogenous over the life cycle of electricity production as well. Agriculture contributed the most to the occupational risks. In the LCRA method, averaging caused the information about the frequency of the risks over life cycle to be lost. The method showed the well-known bargaining between accuracy and simplicity when complex systems are considered. Results from this method were quite homogenous among life cycles, due to the averaging effect. Detailed reporting and follow-up of the worker health issues can enable a more accurate application of the WE-CFs method. The overall results showed that it was possible to apply these 3 methodologies for the EU-28 region.

Implementation of the MLPA required stakeholders to understand and use a complicated set of spatial and scientific guidelines for MPA design that relied heavily on geographic information. Tools for the delivery and visualization of geographic information have changed radically in the seven years of planning during the MLPA Initiative. We collaborated to create a state-of-the-art spatial decision support system called MarineMap to facilitate the design and evaluation of MPA proposals. MarineMap provided an intuitive user experience that simplified complicated spatial concepts, delivered critical information immediately to allow users to iterate through scenarios rapidly. This tool provided transparency in the process, and moved spatial analysis away from the domain of GIS experts to a broader group of stakeholders. We think the lessons from this experience can contribute to the further development of tools and approaches for coastal and marine spatial planning more broadly. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Self-Efficacy and Performance of Research Skills among First-Semester Bioscience Doctoral Students	CBE-LIFE SCIENCES EDUCATION			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN; UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH; SCHOLARLY PRODUCTIVITY; SCIENCE-EDUCATION; PERCEPTIONS; KNOWLEDGE; THINK	Research skills, especially in experimental design, are essential for success in bioscience doctoral training. While there is a growing body of literature on the development of research skills among science, technology, engineering, and mathematics doctoral students, very little is specific to biosciences. We seek to address this gap by characterizing aptitude and self-perceived facility with research skills among incoming bioscience doctoral students, as well as how and why they change over the first semester of doctoral training. Our results reveal variability in research skills self-efficacy and a wide range in aptitude and self-perceived facility with experimental design at the beginning of the semester, both of which are uncorrelated with the duration of predoctoral research experience. We found that students significantly improved in both experimental design performance and research skills self-efficacy over their first semester; students attributed their experience and comfort with experimental design to a variety of factors, including laboratory research, course work, mentoring, and interaction with colleagues. Notably, we found that the largest research skills self-efficacy gains were aligned with material that was covered in students' first-year course work about experimental design. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of explicit training in experimental design and other research skills early in bioscience doctoral training.

However, copyright transfer agreements (CTAs) that are signed by an author prior to publication often indicate whether, and in what form, self-archiving is allowed. The SHERPA/RoMEO database enables easy access to publishers' policies in this area and uses a colour-coding scheme to classify publishers according to their self-archiving status. The database is currently being redeveloped and renamed the Copyright Knowledge Bank. However, it will still assign a colour to individual publishers indicating whether pre-prints can be self-archived (yellow), post-prints can be self-archived (blue), both pre-print and post-print can be archived (green) or neither (white). The nature of CTAs means that these decisions are rarely as straightforward as they may seem, and this paper describes the thinking and considerations that were used in assigning these colours in the light of the underlying principles and definitions of open access. Design/methodology/approach - Detailed analysis of a large number of CTAs led to the development of controlled vocabulary of terms which was carefully analysed to determine how these terms equate to the definition and "spirit" of open access. Findings - The paper reports on how conditions outlined by publishers in their CTAs, such as how or where a paper can be self-archived, affect the assignment of a self-archiving colour to the publisher. Originality/value - The colour assignment is widely used by authors and repository administrators in determining whether academic papers can be self-archived. This paper provides a starting-point for further discussion and development of publisher classification in the open access environment.

A descriptive study	SAO PAULO MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Motor activity; Health information management; Health communication; Research; Biomedical research	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CRITICAL-APPRAISAL; READERS GUIDE; COHORT; INTERVENTION	CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: The current paradigm of science is to accumulate as much research data as possible, with less thought given to navigation or synthesis of the resulting mass, which hampers locating and using the research. The aim here was to describe the number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (SRs) focusing on exercise, and their journal sources, that have been indexed in PubMed over time. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive study conducted at Bond University, Australia. METHOD: To find RCTs, a search was conducted in PubMed Clinical Queries, using the category "Therapy" and the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) term "Exercise". To find SRs, a search was conducted in PubMed Clinical Queries, using the category "Therapy", the MeSH term "Exercise" and various methodological filters. RESULTS: Up until 2011, 9,354 RCTs about exercise were published in 1,250 journals and 1,262 SRs in 513 journals. Journals in the area of Sports Science published the greatest number of RCTs and journals categorized as belonging to "Other health professions" area (for example nursing or psychology) published the greatest number of SRs. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was the principal source for SRs, with 9.8% of the total, while the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research and Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise published 4.4% and 5.0% of the RCTs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid growth and resulting scatter of RCTs and SRs on exercise presents challenges for locating and using this research. Solutions for this issue need to be considered.

Participatory methods increasingly used in healthcare improvement coalesce around the concept of coproduction, and related practices of cocreation, codesign and coinnovation. These participatory methods have become the new Zeitgeist-the spirit of our times in quality improvement. The rationale for this new spirit of participation relates to voice and engagement (those with lived experience should be engaged in processes of development, redesign and improvements), empowerment (engagement in codesign and coproduction has positive individual and societal benefits) and advancement (quality of life and other health outcomes and experiences of services for everyone involved should improve as a result). This paper introduces Mental Health Experience Co-design (MH ECO), a peer designed and led adapted form of Experience-based Co-design (EBCD) developed in Australia. MH ECO is said to facilitate empowerment, foster trust, develop autonomy, self-determination and choice for people living with mental illnesses and their carers, including staff at mental health services. Little information exists about the underlying mechanisms of change; the entities, processes and structures that underpin MH ECO and similar EBCD studies. To address this, we identified eight possible mechanisms from an assessment of the activities and outcomes of MH ECO and a review of existing published evaluations. The eight mechanisms, recognition, dialogue, cooperation, accountability, mobilisation, enactment, creativity and attainment, are discussed within an 'explanatory theoretical model of change' that details these and ideal relational transitions that might be observed or not with MH ECO or other EBCD studies. We critically appraise the sociocultural and political movement in coproduction and draw on interdisciplinary theories from the humanities-narrative theory, dialogical ethics, cooperative and empowerment theory. The model advances theoretical thinking in coproduction beyond motivations and towards identifying underlying processes and entities that might impact on process and outcome.

J	Johnson, MP; Midgley, G; Chichirau, G				Johnson, Michael P.; Midgley, Gerald; Chichirau, George			Emerging trends and new frontiers in community operational research	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Community operational research; Community-based operations research; Analytics; Developing countries; Systems thinking	PROBLEM STRUCTURING METHODS; CRITICAL SYSTEMS THINKING; BOUNDARY CRITIQUE; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; DECISION; INTERVENTION; METHODOLOGY; CITIES; RESILIENCE; ANALYTICS	Community Operational Research (Community OR), and its disciplinary relation, Community-Based Operations Research, has an increasingly high profile within multiple domains that benefit from empirical and analytical approaches to problem solving. These domains are primarily concentrated within nonprofit services and local development. However, there are many other disciplines and application areas for which novel applications and extensions of Community OR could generate valuable insights. This paper identifies a number of these, distinguishing between 'emerging trends' (mostly in well-studied areas of operational research, management science and analytics) and 'new frontiers', which can be found in traditions not commonly oriented towards empirical and analytical methods for problem solving, where community-engaged decision modeling represents new ways of generating knowledge, policies and prescriptions. This paper will show how the exploration of emerging trends and new frontiers in Community OR can provide a basis for the development of innovative research agendas that can broaden the scope and impact of the decision sciences.

What do patients think about the role of optometrists in providing advice about smoking and nutrition?

However, little is known about patients' perceptions and experiences in these areas in relation to the care received from optometrists. The main aim was to survey patients' perceptions and prior experience regarding the role of optometrists in enquiring and providing advice about tobacco smoking and nutrition. Methods: An anonymous, paper-based survey was distributed to a convenience sample of 225 adults attending the University of Melbourne eye care clinic. Respondents provided demographic and other information (age, sex, length of time since last eye examination, country of most recent eye examination, smoking status and intake of nutritional supplements) and indicated their level of agreement (using a five-step Likert scale) with a series of statements relating to the care provided by optometrists in the areas of health, smoking and nutrition. The statements were designed to assess the perceived scope of practice of optometrists and the extent to which patients expect, and feel comfortable, discussing these issues with their optometrist. Results: 220 completed surveys were returned. Most respondents (> 80%) agreed that they visit their optometrist to quantify their refractive error and to examine their eye health. About two-thirds of respondents indicated that they expect their optometrist to ask about their general health, with almost half expecting their optometrist to communicate with their general medical practitioner. Approximately one-third of respondents indicated having been routinely questioned about their smoking status, diet and nutritional supplement intake by their optometrist. This was despite about half expecting their optometrist to question them about these factors and almost three out of four respondents indicating that they felt comfortable talking with their optometrist about these lifestyle behaviours. Conclusions: This study provides novel insight into patients' perceptions and experience with optometric practice in the areas of tobacco smoking and nutrition. The majority of respondents expected their optometrist to examine their eye health, ask them about their smoking and diet habits, and indicated feeling comfortable discussing these topics with their primary eye care provider. These findings suggest that brief advice interventions relating to tobacco use and diet are likely to be acceptable to deliver in optometry practice.

Teaching and learning in STEM education require teachers and students to employ design thinking and multi-disciplinary knowledge to formulate new solutions for emerging problems. School teachers are facing multiple challenges in implementing STEM education. With the application of the Self-efficacy and stages of concern theories, this quantitative study (with 235 teacher respondents) aims to unearth Hong Kong teachers' responses regarding STEM education. The results show that 5.53% of the respondents regard themselves as well prepared for STEM education. On the other hand, the respondents have intense information, management, and consequence concerns about implementing STEM education in schools. The findings reflect that there is an urgent need to provide teachers with articulated professional development, pedagogic support, and curricular resources for empowering them to implement STEM education in practice.

Dopaminergic basis for signaling belief updates, but not surprise, and the link to paranoia	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						Bayesian surprise; information-theoretic surprise; aberrant salience; schizophrenia; Kullback-Leibler divergence	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ABERRANT SALIENCE; SYSTEM RESPONSIVITY; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; PREDICTION ERRORS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DECISION-MAKING; D-3 RECEPTORS; AMPHETAMINE	Distinguishing between meaningful and meaningless sensory information is fundamental to forming accurate representations of the world. Dopamine is thought to play a central role in processing the meaningful information content of observations, which motivates an agent to update their beliefs about the environment. However, direct evidence for dopamine's role in human belief updating is lacking. We addressed this question in healthy volunteers who performed a model-based fMRI task designed to separate the neural processing of meaningful and meaningless sensory information. We modeled participant behavior using a normative Bayesian observer model and used the magnitude of the model-derived belief update following an observation to quantify its meaningful information content. We also acquired PET imaging measures of dopamine function in the same subjects. We show that the magnitude of belief updates about task structure (meaningful information), but not pure sensory surprise (meaningless information), are encoded in midbrain and ventral striatum activity. Using PET we show that the neural encoding of meaningful information is negatively related to dopamine-2/3 receptor availability in the midbrain and dexamphetamine-induced dopamine release capacity in the striatum. Trial-by-trial analysis of task performance indicated that subclinical paranoid ideation is negatively related to behavioral sensitivity to observations carrying meaningful information about the task structure. The findings provide direct evidence implicating dopamine in model-based belief updating in humans and have implications for understating the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders where dopamine function is disrupted.

J	Novak, AM; Treagust, DF				Novak, Ann M.; Treagust, David F.			Adjusting claims as new evidence emerges: Do students incorporate new evidence into their scientific explanations?	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING			English	Article						claims; 3-dimensional learning; evidence; explanations; middle school; project-based learning; water quality	ANOMALOUS DATA; SCIENCE; LITERACY	Constructing explanations of complex phenomena is an important part of doing science and it is also an important component of learning science. Students need opportunities to make claims based on available evidence and then use science concepts to justify why evidence supports the claim. But what happens when new evidence emerges for the same phenomenon? The claim portion of the claim, evidence, and reasoning explanation framework is viewed as the most accessible to students. When new evidence suggests that students adjust their current thinking however, do students incorporate this new information and modify their claims? This research utilized a time series research design to explore how students modify their claim over four iterations of one explanation, termed an evolving explanation. As new data were collected and analyzed to provide additional evidence, students needed to evaluate their current claim to see if it took into account all available evidence. This research explores that process including the supports that the teacher provided and the challenges that students faced in developing one claim, over time. The findings indicate that many students face challenges adjusting their claims when new, conflicting evidence emerges, even with class discussion, teacher feedback, and written scaffolds. Several possible reasons exist to account for this challenge. Students may (1) ignore new evidence, (2) find undoing their initial idea too cognitively demanding, or (3) simply not have any similar experience from which to build. Providing students with experiences of writing evolving explanations reflects what scientists do, while simultaneously preparing students to become more scientifically proficient.

Chronic heart failure patients' understanding of and beliefs about their illness and its treatment: A qualitative longitudinal study from Uganda	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HEALTH; LITERACY; OUTCOMES; AFRICA	Background Patients with heart failure in Uganda present for health care with advanced structural heart disease, have repeated hospitalizations and poorly controlled disease symptoms. The reasons for these are unclear. Literature from other settings shows that patients' understanding of their illness and their beliefs influence their health related behaviour. The study aimed to explore the beliefs of patients with heart failure, their understanding of their illness and its treatment, and how this influenced their health related behaviour to inform future health education programs, information and palliative care services. Methods Serial qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with Heart Failure patients who were purposively sampled and recruited in Mulago National Referral Hospital until thematic saturation was reached. In-depth interviews were conducted at three time points over the course of their illness with intervals of 3 months between interviews. A grounded theory approach was used in data analysis. The University of Edinburgh ethics committee, Mulago Hospital Research Ethics committee and the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (Reference numbers D/GC/178; MREC 33, SS 3083 respectively) approved the research. Results A total of 40 face to face qualitative longitudinal interviews (36-patient alone, 4 paired-patient and family carer), were conducted with 21 patients. The findings revealed that heart failure patients were unaware of the symptoms of the illness and their definition of illness differed from that of health professionals. Patients understood their diagnosis, cause of illness, prognosis and the importance of the medicines differently from health professionals, and had insufficient information on self-care. Lay beliefs were used to explain many aspects of the illness and treatments. All these influenced where patients sought care and their adherence to treatment, self-care and follow up leading to uncontrolled disease. Conclusion There is a high level of health illiteracy among heart failure patients in Uganda. Patients rely on lay beliefs to make health decisions and medical information is often miscomprehended. There is an urgent need for health education using culturally appropriate information.

There is a growing recognition that the moral issues associated with the use of the new technologies should be brought to the attention of If students. Furthermore, they should be encouraged to explore and think more deeply about the social and legal consequences of the use of ICTs. This paper describes the development of a tool designed to raise students' awareness of the social impact of ICTs. The tool offers guidance to students undertaking computing and computer-related courses when considering the social, legal and professional implications of the actions of participants in situations of ethical conflict. However, unlike previous work in this field, this tool is not based on an artificial intelligence paradigm. Aspects of the theoretical basis for the design of the tool and the tool's practical development are discussed. Preliminary results from the testing of the tool are also discussed.

J	Nakamura, J; Ohsawa, Y				Nakamura, Jun; Ohsawa, Yukio			A shift of mind - Introducing a concept creation model	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Creativity; Concept; Ambiguity and constraint	DESIGN	The ability to construct concepts is indispensable to both individual and evolutionary development. Our model involves the use of ambiguous stimuli to facilitate decision-making by promoting analogical reasoning. Toward this end, we have developed Web-based exercises in word categorization for the purpose of engaging participants in analogical reasoning that contributes to the integration of words and leads to the construction of new concepts. 12 graduate students and 20 junior high school students were presented with ambiguous information for the purpose of comparison between the senior and the junior students. We hypothesized that the senior students tend to behave with more insight rather than junior students with less activation of thought process. Our results suggested that the presentation of the ambiguous stimuli were associated with unique thought processes, which are consistent with approaches to word categorization that reflect either the experience of insight or the operation of a trial and error strategy, depending on the junior or the senior students. We showed that the senior students tend to be more like insight into categorization design, while the junior as rather try and error behavior, in consideration of needed time and actions in analogical thinking.

It is therefore important to understand the barriers and facilitators of aspirin adherence in pregnancy. This sub-analysis of a qualitative study conducted to better understand barriers and facilitators of aspirin adherence was set to describe informational needs related to aspirin use in pregnancy. Study design: A qualitative study was conducted with 14 postnatal women from North-East of England, who declared various levels of non-adherence to aspirin (0-5/7 prescribed). A thematic framework analysis of semi structured interviews was used. Outcome measures: Emerging themes associated with informational needs about aspirin use in pregnancy. Results: Main themes identified a) Informational needs, b) Nature of the information seeking behaviour (active vs passive), c) Sources of information, d) Preferred format of information, e) Partners seeking knowledge. Not all women actively seek information; some choose not to pursue it as they find thinking of hypothetical risks disturbing. When information is accessed, women use a wide range of informational resources from scientific articles and National Health Services website to social media sources and word-of-mouth. Women admit that reading leaflets can be difficult, preferring to receive information in interactive ways. Although partners seek information about risks and risk reduction strategies, they are often not included in conversations with health care professionals. Conclusion: New interactive and accessible informational resources are needed to engage pregnant women and their partners in aspirin prophylactic therapy.

The tool was developed on a theoretical basis with reference to existing tools and models and it collects four types of human factors information including (a) the action errors occurring immediately prior to the incident, (b) error recovery mechanisms, in the case of near misses, (c) the thought processes which lead to the action error and (d) the underlying causes. The investigation tool was evaluated on the basis of (i) an inter-rater reliability assessment, (ii) usability assessment, (iii) case studies and (iv) an evaluation system developed by Benner [Benner, L. 1985. Rating accident models and investigation methodologies. Journal of Safety Research 16, 105-126] Evaluation system. Although there is a need for further validation and analysis of HFIT using more realistic accident scenario exercises, some validation of the tool has been possible. In addition, it has been shown, in a small sample of accident investigations, that HFIT was found to be useful for the development of remedial actions, one of the main objectives of the tool.

US COVID-19 State Government Public Dashboards: An Expert Review	APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						data visualization; coronavirus infections; pandemics; geographic information systems; access to information	RECOVERY	Background In the United States, all 50 state governments deployed publicly viewable dashboards regarding the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to track and respond to the pandemic. States dashboards, however, reflect idiosyncratic design practices based on their content, function, and visual design and platform. There has been little guidance for what state dashboards should look like or contain, leading to significant variation. Objectives The primary objective of our study was to catalog how information, system function, and user interface were deployed across the COVID-19 state dashboards. Our secondary objective was to group and characterize the dashboards based on the information we collected using clustering analysis. Methods For preliminary data collection, we developed a framework to first analyze two dashboards as a group and reach agreement on coding. We subsequently doubled coded the remaining 48 dashboards using the framework and reviewed the coding to reach total consensus. Results All state dashboards included maps and graphs, most frequently line charts, bar charts, and histograms. The most represented metrics were total deaths, total cases, new cases, laboratory tests, and hospitalization. Decisions on how metrics were aggregated and stratified greatly varied across dashboards. Overall, the dashboards were very interactive with 96% having at least some functionality including tooltips, zooming, or exporting capabilities. For visual design and platform, we noted that the software was dominated by a few major organizations. Our cluster analysis yielded a six-cluster solution, and each cluster provided additional insights about how groups of states engaged in specific practices in dashboard design. Conclusion Our study indicates that states engaged in dashboard practices that generally aligned with many of the goals set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Essential Public Health Services. We highlight areas where states fall short of these expectations and provide specific design recommendations to address these gaps.

INDUCED AND LOGARITHMIC DISTANCES WITH MULTI-REGION AGGREGATION OPERATORS	TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMY			English	Article						OWA; decision-making science; logarithmic OWA operators; multiregion AGOP; induced OWA operators; distance OWA operators; induced distance logarithmic AGOP	GROUP DECISION-MAKING; WEIGHTED AVERAGING OPERATOR; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; MOVING AVERAGES; CREATIVE CLASS; INFORMATION	This paper introduces the induced ordered weighted logarithmic averaging IOWLAD and multiregion induced ordered weighted logarithmic averaging MR-IOWLAD operators. The distinctive characteristic of these operators lies in the notion of distance measures combined with the complex reordering mechanism of inducing variables and the properties of the logarithmic averaging operators. The main advantage of MR-IOWLAD operators is their design, which is specifically thought to aid in decision-making when a set of diverse regions with different properties must be considered. Moreover, the induced weighting vector and the distance measure mechanisms of the operator allow for the wider modeling of problems, including heterogeneous information and the complex attitudinal character of experts, when aiming for an ideal scenario. Along with analyzing the main properties of the IOWLAD operators, their families and specific cases, we also introduce some extensions, such as the induced generalized ordered weighted averaging IGOWLAD operator and Choquet integrals. We present the induced Choquet logarithmic distance averaging ICLD operator and the generalized induced Choquet logarithmic distance averaging IGCLD operator. Finally, an illustrative example is proposed, including real-world information retrieved from the United Nations World Statistics for global regions.

Methods Cross-sections of hair fibre have been examined with X-ray microdiffraction oriented perpendicular to the surface of the cross-sections. AFM investigations were carried out for further investigating and deciphering the structure of the cuticle. Moisture sorption analytics of cuticle separated from fibre and mechanical tests of decuticled fibres against virgin fibres were used for understanding the role of the cuticle in the economy of hair fibre. Results Previously unknown swelling behaviour of the hair cuticle during moisture sorption has been revealed, as has an increased significance of the cuticle's role in moisture management at higher values of relative humidity. Through AFM investigation, the reaction of hair cuticles with chlorine water has further strengthened the idea that the Allworden membrane does not exist, and is actually an artefact of the delamination of the A-layer and exocuticle from the underlying endocuticle. Using decuticled fibres for stress-strain tests, and by comparing the results with those of virgin fibres, the effect of the cuticle on the post-yield area of the hair fibre stress-strain diagram has also been demonstrated. Finally, X-ray microdiffraction and AFM investigations suggest that the cuticle possesses a small-scale ordered structure, based on possibly not fully crystalline and irregularly arranged alpha-helices oriented almost perpendicular to the growth axis of the fibre and enhancing the general description of cuticle as the protective layer of the fibre. Conclusion The role of the cuticle for the hair fibre is more complex than previously thought. The cuticle is demonstrated not only to possess a hidden rod-matrix structure, that supports its protective nature, but also to play specific roles in the fibre's response to moisture, and in fibre mechanical behaviour.

J	Flaherty, AA				Flaherty, A. A.			Investigating perceptions of the structure and development of scientific knowledge in the context of a transformed organic chemistry lecture course	CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article							GENERAL-CHEMISTRY; EPISTEMOLOGICAL RESOURCES; TEACHERS CONCEPTIONS; MOLECULAR-STRUCTURE; SCIENCE; STUDENTS; RELIABILITY; PHILOSOPHY; FRAMEWORK; EDUCATION	Organic Chemistry, Life, the Universe and Everything (OCLUE) is an undergraduate lecture-based organic chemistry course that has been transformed in line with the vision for science education set out by the 'Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts and Core Ideas' (National Research Council, 2012). OCLUE is designed to progress students understanding of core ideas in organic chemistry through the use of scientific practices such as constructing explanations, predictions and models. The purpose of this study is to generate theory on how OCLUE students conceptualise the structure and development of scientific knowledge. Eleven students with diverse experiences and exam performances were interviewed. The data was collected and analysed in accordance with the tenants of constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2000). OCLUE students conceptualised a hierarchical structure of scientific knowledge whereby behind claims and answers in science is important information that determines the validity of the claim or answer. Being adept in utilising this information was important to students in OCLUE as it provided them with the opportunity to account for why phenomena occur in organic chemistry. Students explained that the process of developing scientific knowledge is rarely straight-forward or pre-determined. Instead it was believed that scientists needed to piece together what they know in seemingly random ways in order to solve science puzzles. In the context of OCLUE, students explained that memorising information ahead of OCLUE exams was insufficient. Instead they had to synthesise and interrogate their prior understanding to figure out new problems encountered in OCLUE exams. Students attributed the efficacy of OCLUE's pedagogy to helping them engage in constructivist thinking processes that involved interrogating and applying their prior knowledge. This contributes to the understanding that OCLUE has set out a precedent organic chemistry course that can foster a more scientific way of learning science that contrasts students' engagement in considerably arduous memorisation techniques.

ASLIB PROCEEDINGS			English	Article						Relevance criteria; Relevance judgement; Image retrieval; Medical imaging; Image seeking behaviour; Health care; Visual databases; Information retrieval; Digital images; Medical personnel	RELEVANCE CRITERIA; USERS CRITERIA; RETRIEVAL	Purpose - This paper aims to report the results of a study investigating the relevance criteria used by health care professionals when seeking medical images. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 29 participants using a think-aloud protocol and face-to-face interviews and analysed using the Straussian version of grounded theory (GT). Findings - The results show that participants made use of 15 relevance criteria, although they agreed on topicality being the most important. The findings suggest that users apply different criteria in different situations when evaluating the relevancy of medical images. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, there have been few studies that investigate relevance judgments for visually orientated documents. Thus, this study helps to contribute to the understanding of medical image resources and the information needs of health care professionals. A clear understanding of the medical image information needs of health care professionals is also vital to the design process and development of medical image retrieval systems.

First models for structural energy transmission decoupling in the high frequency regime under aerodynamic excitations	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Structural design; energy decoupling; statistical energy analysis; turbulent boundary layer; wind tunnel facilities	SOUND-TRANSMISSION; DESIGN; PLATES	In the wind tunnel facility, a test structure is often used for measuring its vibrational response to the aerodynamic excitation. A support is needed to sustaining the structure and it is mandatory that this support does not influence the vibrational energy to be measured. To this aim, the maximum amount of energy decoupling between the structure and the support is desired. This work is focused around a quick method to estimate this decoupling by using simplified models for the Turbulent Boundary Layer (TBL) excitation and for the structural response. Specifically, the Equivalent Rain-on-the-roof excitation is invoked with a Statistical Energy Analysis model for the structure. Some simple design rules are proposed and based on little information leading to foresee the difference of vibrational velocity levels between the two structural systems. A simplified test-case is used for the first investigations and a complex structure is finally conceived thinking to vibroacoustic measurements in a large wind tunnel facility. Although some results are largely expected, the global approach is promising.	[Mazzeo, G.; Ichchou, M.

J	Haithcoat, T; Liu, DL; Young, T; Shyu, CR				Haithcoat, Timothy; Liu, Danlu; Young, Tiffany; Shyu, Chi-Ren			Investigating Health Context Using a Spatial Data Analytical Tool: Development of a Geospatial Big Data Ecosystem	JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						context; Geographic Information System; big data; equity; population health; public health; digital health; eHealth; location; geospatial; data analytics; analytical framework; medical informatics; research knowledgebase	AIR-POLLUTION; MENTAL-HEALTH; PLACE; RESIDENCE; EXPOSURE; JUSTICE; ACCESS; ASTHMA; CARE	Background: Enabling the use of spatial context is vital to understanding today's digital health problems. Any given location is associated with many different contexts. The strategic transformation of population health, epidemiology, and eHealth studies requires vast amounts of integrated digital data. Needed is a novel analytical framework designed to leverage location to create new contextual knowledge. The Geospatial Analytical Research Knowledgebase (GeoARK), a web-based research resource has robust, locationally integrated, social, environmental, and infrastructural information to address today's complex questions, investigate context, and spatially enable health investigations. GeoARK is different from other Geographic Information System (GIS) resources in that it has taken the layered world of the GIS and flattened it into a big data table that ties all the data and information together using location and developing its context. Objective: It is paramount to build a robust spatial data analytics framework that integrates social, environmental, and infrastructural knowledge to empower health researchers' use of geospatial context to timely answer population health issues. The goal is twofold in that it embodies an innovative technological approach and serves to ease the educational burden for health researchers to think spatially about their problems. Methods: A unique analytical tool using location as the key was developed. It allows integration across source, geography, and time to create a geospatial big table with over 162 million individual locations (X-Y points that serve as rows) and 5549 attributes (represented as columns). The concept of context (adjacency, proximity, distance, etc) is quantified through geoanalytics and captured as new distance, density, or neighbor attributes within the system. Development of geospatial analytics permits contextual extraction and investigator-initiated eHealth and mobile health (mHealth) analysis across multiple attributes. Results: We built a unique geospatial big data ecosystem called GeoARK. Analytics on this big table occur across resolution groups, sources, and geographies for extraction and analysis of information to gain new insights. Case studies, including telehealth assessment in North Carolina, national income inequality and health outcome disparity, and a Missouri COVID-19 risk assessment, demonstrate the capability to support robust and efficient geospatial understanding of a wide spectrum of population health questions. Conclusions: This research identified, compiled, transformed, standardized, and integrated multifaceted data required to better understand the context of health events within a large location-enabled database. The GeoARK system empowers health professionals to engage more complex research where the synergisms of health and geospatial information will be robustly studied beyond what could be accomplished today. No longer is the need to know how to perform geospatial processing an impediment to the health researcher, but rather the development of how to think spatially becomes the greater challenge.

J	Danchin, A				Danchin, Antoine			Nature or manufacture: What should we fear most?	COMPTES RENDUS BIOLOGIES			English	Article						Synthetic biology; Information; Invasiveness; Domestication; Natural selection		Of very ancient descent, domestication switched the outcome of natural selection to that due to human design. A widespread fancy is that man-created contraptions develop dangerously on their own because of their Promethean essence. This assumes implicitly-how difficult is it to refrain from thinking that we are the sawyers of nature!-that their crafted powers would dominate the autonomy resulting from billions of years of evolution. Yet artifice depends on the skills of its creator, so that it is when coming close to nature that danger surfaces. Invasive species are natural, and the havoc they create is here to call for some modesty in the appraisal of our endeavours. The farther away, the less dangerous. Being distant from man, engineered plants are considerably less harmful than animal constructs, especially those that are close to man and meant for medical use. This reality contrasts with popular belief. In this misconception lies the danger, magnified by the present demographic explosion of the invasive species Homo sapiens, which develops artificial environments that provide progressively less room for life to evolve.

J	Missimer, M; Robèrt, KH; Broman, G				Missimer, Merlina; Robert, Karl-Henrik; Broman, Goran			A strategic approach to social sustainability - Part 1: exploring the social system	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Strategic sustainable development; Social sustainability; Social system; Systems thinking; Sustainability principles	ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; RESILIENCE; SCIENCE; DEFINITION; MANAGEMENT; TRUSTWORTHINESS; ADAPTABILITY; PERSPECTIVE; INFORMATION; ADAPTATION	The vast and growing array of concepts, methods and tools in the sustainability field imply a need for a structuring and coordinating framework, including a unifying and operational definition of sustainability. One attempt at such framework began over 25 years ago and is now widely known as the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development. However, as with the larger sustainability field, the social dimension of this framework has been found to not be sufficiently science-based and operational and thus in need of further development. In this two-part series an attempt at a science-based, operational definition of social sustainability is presented. In this paper (part one), a systems-based approach to the social system is presented, as a basis for presenting a zero-hypothesis of principles for social sustainability in part two. Extensive literature studies as well as conceptual modelling sessions were performed and the social system was examined from various angles complex adaptive system studies, human needs theory and other social sciences, and insights from these fields were woven together. The whole work was structured and guided by the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development. The focus of the study was on the essential aspects of the social system that need to be sustained (that cannot be systematically degraded) for it to be possible for people to meet their needs. These essential aspects were found to be trust, common meaning, diversity, capacity for learning and capacity for self-organization. Trust seems to be generally acknowledged to be the overriding aspect of a vital social system. A sense of common meaning is also stated by several authors as an important part of social capital and something that helps to keep a group or society together. Diversity is acknowledged as essential for resilience; in the human social system this can be interpreted as, e.g., diversity of personalities, ages, gender, skills. Capacity for learning and self-organization are also motivated from a resilience point of view by several authors. These results form a basis for the hypothesis for a definition of social sustainability presented in paper 2, which in turn is a step towards creating an enhanced support for strategic planning and innovation for sustainability.

J	Field, A				Field, Ambrose			Mining the ambient commons: building interdisciplinary connections between environmental knowledge, AI and creative practice research	INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Creativity; research design; AI; complex systems; musical composition; technical rationality; creative computation; change processes		According to Brooks [2017. "The Big Problem with Self-driving Cars Is People". IEEE Spectrum: Technology, Engineering, and Science News], artificial intelligence has had a variable track-record of usefulness in situations where context and environmental knowledge are responsible for shaping human interactions. In 2021, providing contextually aware training to supervised machine learning is still a non-trivial task for AI models that involve complex systems. In addition, knowledge held only across distributed members of a community, within culture, or tacitly within the wider environment of the ambient commons [McCullough 2013. Ambient Commons: Attention in the Age of Embodied Information. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press] evades consistent generalizable modelling - even in technical domains such as traffic flow management, atmospheric chemistry, or the prediction of election results. Yet it is precisely these interactions of context, community, culture and environment that also define how music can be created. The creative arts can themselves be thought of as a complex system. Assuming that creativity is non-generalizable, this paper assesses creative processes through a humanities-centric lens of machine learning and robotics, aiming to better understand relationships between context, environment and experimental system in artistic research. These relationships are now themselves significantly digitally mediated, requiring a change in academic discourse away from artefacts which need discrete research justification towards a more holistic, and often non-linear view of networks that require cultural situation. In doing so, issues of creative accountability [Field 2021. "Changing the Vocabulary of Creative Research: The Role of Networks, Risk, and Accountability in Transcending Technical Rationality." In Sound Work: Composition as Critical Technical Practice, edited by J. Impett, 303-317.Orpheus Institute Series. Leuven: Leuven University Press] and the implications of substituting "creative question" for "research question" are examined within creative research. Early twentieth century ideas related to progressivism which have instrumentalized creative practice, particularly where technology forms part of art making, are challenged by re-thinking change through new models. The Three Horizons change model [Sharpe 2016. "Three Horizons: A Pathways Practice for Transformation." Ecology and Society 21 (2): 47] originally intended to describe environmental ecosystems, is assessed as a practical tool for designing creative research.

J	Torres, O; Bong, D				Torres, Oscar; Bong, Dennis			Determinants of Membrane Activity from Mutational Analysis of the HIV Fusion Peptide	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							AMINO-TERMINAL PEPTIDE; NONVIRAL GENE DELIVERY; LIPID MIXING FUNCTION; DE-NOVO DESIGN; ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES; CONFORMATIONAL-CHANGE; COMBINATORIAL DESIGN; INFLUENZA-VIRUS; GP41; PH	We have synthesized a small library of 38 variants of the 23-residue fusion peptide domain found at the N-terminus of gp41 glycoprotein of HIV. This hydrophobic, glycine-rich sequence is critical for viral infectivity and is thought to be central in the membrane fusion of viral envelope with the host membrane. There has been extensive discussion regarding the origin of fusogenicity in this viral fusion sequence. Our library of fusion peptide variants was designed to address the biophysical importance of secondary structure, peptide flexibility, glycine content, and placement. We assayed each peptide for its ability to induce lipid mixing and membrane permeablization in synthetic vesicles. We find that the viral fusion peptide may be greatly simplified while retaining fusogenic function and minimizing membrane-permeablizing function; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to optimize fusogenic function of the HIV fusion peptide through sequence variation. Our data show that many flexible, linear, minimally hydrophobic peptides may achieve the biophysical function of fusion; glycine does not appear to be essential. These findings will be useful in the design of synthetic fusogens for cellular delivery.

An assessment of patient perspectives on pharmacogenomics educational materials	PHARMACOGENOMICS			English	Article						patient education; pharmacogenetics; pharmacogenomics testing; qualitative methods; think aloud	INTEGRATING PHARMACOGENOMICS; RIGHT DRUG; QR CODES; INFORMATION; READABILITY; PHYSICIANS; KNOWLEDGE; VIDEO	Aim: Pharmacogenomics (PGx) holds potential to improve patient treatment; yet, effective patient educational materials are limited. Materials & methods: Using a 'think aloud' technique, we sought to understand comprehension and perceptions of a multimedia PGx results packet including a cover letter with QR code to an educational video, brochure and prototype report in the context of PGx case vignettes. Results: The cover letter and video components were viewed less favorably due to excess detail, complex jargon and technology challenges. Recommendations were to enhance comprehension and utility and to customize materials to each patient's medications or disease conditions. Conclusion: Educational materials were revised to improve comprehension and usability, and diminish concerns to better prepare patients to understand the importance of discussing test results with their provider.

J	Evans, RL; Maiers, MJ; Bronfort, G				Evans, RL; Maiers, MJ; Bronfort, G			What do patients think? Results of a mixed methods pilot study assessing sciatica patients' interpretations of satisfaction and improvement	JOURNAL OF MANIPULATIVE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article						satisfaction; outcome measures; low back pain; qualitative research	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; LOW-BACK-PAIN; NATURAL-HISTORY; PHYSIOTHERAPY; DISABILITY; TRIAL; CARE	Background: Little is known about the issues low back pain patients take into account when deciding their satisfaction with care, the importance placed on such satisfaction, or the factors they consider when assessing their overall improvement. Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore these issues and to assess the feasibility of implementing qualitative research methods within a clinical trial. Methods: Study participants were volunteers taking part in a randomized clinical pilot study comparing nonsurgical treatments for sciatica. Face-to-face interviews were conducted, transcribed, and analyzed using content analysis. Results: All 31 individuals who participated in the pilot study were interviewed. When asked which issues they considered when deciding their satisfaction with care, the most frequently identified themes were change in pain, personnel, and the treatment experience. When assessing their overall improvement, all participants considered whether their pain had changed. In response to the question asking participants which outcomes they considered to be most important. severity of pain and quality of life were most commonly cited. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that a "mixed methods" approach using qualitative research methods within a clinical trial is not only feasible but can provide interesting and useful information for trial interpretation and future study design. By providing insight to the multidimensional nature of patients' beliefs and perceptions, this technique may not only shape but also redefine the focus of patient-oriented research and health care for low back pain conditions.

J	Armenia, S; Arquitt, S; Pedercini, M; Pompei, A				Armenia, Stefano; Arquitt, Steven; Pedercini, Matteo; Pompei, Alessandro			Anticipating human resilience and vulnerability on the path to 2030: What can we learn from COVID-19	FUTURES			English	Article						Misperception of feedback and delays; Behavioural pattern awareness; Systems thinking; system dynamics; COVID-19; Climate change	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; SCIENCE; HEALTH; KEY	The COVID-19 pandemic is causing unprecedented damage to our society and economy, globally impacting progress towards the SDGs. The integrated perspective that Agenda 2030 calls for is ever more important for understanding the vulnerability of our eco-socio-economic systems and for designing policies for enhanced resilience. Since the emergence of COVID-19, countries and international institutions have strengthened their monitoring systems to produce timely data on infections, fostering data-driven decision-making often without the support of systemic-based simulation models. Evidence from the initial phases of the pandemic indicates that countries that were able to implement effective policies before the number of cases grew large (e.g. Australia) managed to contain COVID-19 to a much greater extent than others. We argue that prior systemic knowledge of a phenomenon provides the essential information to correctly interpret data, develop a better understanding of the emerging behavioural patterns and potentially develop early qualitative awareness of how to react promptly in the early phases of destructive phenomena, eventually providing the ground for building more effective simulation models capable of better anticipating the effects of policies. This is even more important as, on its path to 2030, humanity will face other challenges of similar dynamic nature. Chief among these is Climate Change. In this paper, we show how a Systems Thinking and System Dynamics modelling approach is useful for developing a better understanding of these and other issues, and how systemic lessons learned from the COVID-19 case can help decision makers anticipate the destructive dynamics of Climate Change by improving perceptions of the potential impacts of reinforcing feedback and delays, ultimately leading to more timely interventions to achieve the SDGs and mitigate Climate Change risks.

The former focuses on multi-stage thinking, problem solving, and information processing in threes under dynamic decision information systems. The latter aims to multilevel and multiview comprehension, abstraction, data representations in threes by information granularity and hierarchical granular structures. This paper explores the integration of both to process dynamic hybrid data by sequential three-way decision. In the context of three-way granular computing, we introduce three extensional ideas: temporality-based, spatiality-based, integration-based trisecting-acting-outcome (TAO) frameworks. Subsequently, we present three fundamental methods for the construction of multilevel composite granular structure. Three kinds of fusion strategies for dynamic hybrid data by decision attitudes and operation combinations are discussed. Finally, we design a composite sequential algorithm and experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Design/methodology/approach Literature reviews, ISM, a questionnaire survey and expert interviews were used in this paper. First, the risk factors of BIM technology application and their relationships were determined by consulting the relevant BIM literature. Second, to more intuitively reflect the relationships between risk factors, an ISM model based on expert interviews was established to structure the explanatory relationships and hierarchical relationships between factors. Finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted for relevant practitioners, and a scale was designed to evaluate the risk factors of BIM technology application to determine the risk factors that have a greater impact on implementing BIM technology. Findings The root risk factors of BIM technology consist of unclear data ownership, incomplete standard BIM systems, lack of industry insurance, lack of BIM technicians, lack of BIM project practice experience, BIM infrastructure preparation, inconsistent thinking about BIM from project participants, changes in delivery mode and software function problems. Research limitations/implications The risk-sharing of BIM technology and the analysis of responsibilities, rights and benefits of all parties in a BIM project can be used as future research directions to solve higher management problems. Originality/value This paper describes the risks of BIM technology application for related researchers and provides another research train of thought for the follow-up studies.

J	Stocker, A; Richter, A; Kaiser, C; Softic, S				Stocker, Alexander; Richter, Alexander; Kaiser, Christian; Softic, Selver			Exploring barriers of enterprise search implementation: a qualitative user study	ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Information retrieval; Information systems; Information management; Knowledge management; Enterprise search	ACCEPTANCE; WEB; TECHNOLOGY	Purpose - Despite a growing demand for enterprise search from practice, little is known about its implementation from an academic perspective. As the few available practice-oriented investigations show, enterprise search user satisfaction is rather low. The purpose of this paper is therefore to explore user-centric barriers of enterprise search implementation in order to increase user satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach - Results are built on a qualitative user study in an R&D organization. Findings are gained from think-aloud observations introduced by semi-structured interviews in which ten knowledge workers explore a newly implemented enterprise search tool. Findings - Findings illustrate barriers that knowledge workers have to overcome when adopting enterprise search to find project-relevant documents. Implementation barriers relate to selection for keywords, search query formulation, availability and adequacy of metadata, relevance judging of search results, current search strategies, and overall perception of enterprise search usefulness. Research limitations/implications - Limitations address the piloted enterprise search software, along with its specific configuration and scope, the chosen research approach of generating qualitative findings from a single case, and the size of the involved sample of engineers. Implications address measures to increase enterprise search adoption. Practical implications - This study provides project managers with knowledge to take appropriate actions in the early phases of enterprise search implementation, and even prior to that, to raise the success of enterprise search projects. It contributes to a better understanding of enterprise search engine user needs and assists in concretizing user requirements. Originality/value - While existing studies primarily focus on advancing the technical perspective of search in organizations, the author elaborate on the under-investigated social and organizational aspects. The author furthermore stress the importance of user-centered approaches for enterprise search adoption.

However, most previous methods fragmented the relationship between quantification and visualization analysis, which affects the interpretability, accuracy and comprehensiveness of the extracted information. To this end, this paper proposes distribution recurrence plots (DRP) and measures (DRM) to realize the unity of visualization and quantification analysis of the signals. Specifically, DRP is a novel feature graphical representation method following the thought of symbolic dynamics. Derived from DRP, DRM is developed containing four quantifiers for extracting comprehensive fault features that allows a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) to identify the fault types of wind turbine drivetrain system (WTDS). Specially in DRM, pattern entropy is a newly designed quantifier by considering pattern distribution to obtained more accurate quantitative representation of the sig-nals. Using simulated data, DRP and DRM are validated to reveal the intrinsic structural changes for different dynamic systems and robustness to noise. Applications on wind turbine gearbox illustrate that the proposed method has favorable diagnosis performance and stability compared with other competitors. This approach is easy to interpret, is robust to noise, and has a low computational burden, becoming viable for WTDS fault diagnosis.

However, patients are heterogeneous in the severity of the condition and in ways that affect what treatment effect they can expect. It is therefore important to understand and characterize how treatment effects vary. The design and analysis of clinical studies play critical roles in evaluating and characterizing heterogeneous treatment effects. This panel discussed considerations in design and analysis under the recognition that there are heterogeneous treatment effects across subgroups of patients. Panel members discussed many questions including: What is a good estimate of the treatment effect in me, a 65-year-old, bald, Caucasian-American, male patient? What magnitude of heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) is sufficiently large to merit attention? What role can prior evidence about HTE play in confirmatory trial design and analysis? Is there anything described in the 21st Century Cures Act that would benefit from greater attention to HTE? An example of a Bayesian approach addressing multiplicity when testing for treatment effects in subgroups will be provided. We can do more or better at understanding heterogeneous treatment effects and providing the best information on heterogeneous treatment effects.

This study addresses how the reliability of supply chains' carbon-related information can become more transparent and reliable through a decentralized approach based on blockchain thinking (BT), issues that have been identified as a gap in the literature and in the practice. Scenario analysis and design science research (DSR) are used as a methodological driver to conceptualize over the nature of practical solutions using unified modeling language (UML) diagrams. The resulting use-case focuses on data retrieval in the supply chain. The paper also presents implications for the audit industry and their role in the assurance of such technological architecture implementations. The study is visionary as it offers a conceptualization based on scenario analysis. Developing a scenario enables researchers to depict a prospective situation, develop ability to solve future problems, and to back cast them in current policies, technologies, and actions.

Although this documentation generally improves patient safety, it has become a time-consuming task for nurses, which limits their time with the patient. On the basis of a user-centered methodology, we have developed a mobile app named BEDSide Mobility to support nurses in their daily workflow and to facilitate documentation at the bedside. Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the usability of the BEDSide Mobility app in terms of the navigation and interaction design through usability testing. Methods: Nurses were asked to complete a scenario reflecting their daily work with patients. Their interactions with the app were captured with eye-tracking glasses and by using the think aloud protocol. After completing the tasks, participants filled out the system usability scale questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize task completion rates and the users' performance. Results: A total of 10 nurses (aged 21-50) participated in the study. Overall, they were satisfied with the navigation, layout, and interaction design of the app, with the exception of one user who was unfamiliar with smartphones. The problems identified were related to the ambiguity of some icons, the navigation logic, and design inconsistency. Conclusions: Besides the usability issues identified in the app, the participants' results do indicate good usability, high acceptance, and high satisfaction with the developed app. However, the results must be taken with caution because of the poor ecological validity of the experimental setting.

Patient Preference for Surgical Method of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair: Postal Survey	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						Abdominal aortic aneurysm; Patient satisfaction; Vascular surgical procedures; Questionnaires, consumer health information	ENDOVASCULAR REPAIR; COST-EFFECTIVENESS	Objectives: To determine whether men with small abdominal aortic aneurysm have a preference between either endovascular or open aneurysm repair for future treatment. Design: Prospective study of self-declared treatment preference following receipt of a validated patient information pack. Participants: Men aged 65-84 years (n = 237) with asymptomatic aneurysm (4.0-5.4 cm) detected by population-based screening. Methods: An unbiased, validated patient information pack and questionnaire were developed to conduct a postal survey. Results: One hundred sixty seven participants (70%) returned a completed questionnaire; 24 (10%) did not respond at all. Initially, only 38 (23%) declared a treatment preference. After reading the information pack, 130 participants (80%) declared a treatment preference: 30 preferred open repair (18%), 77 endovascular repair (46%), 23 were happy with either option (14%) and only 34 remained without any preference (20%). Nearly all (92%) thought that the information pack had prepared them well for future discussions with clinicians and with no single feature identified as influencing the preference-making process, 66 respondents (40%) still opted to 'take the advice of the doctor'. Conclusion: The patient information pack facilitated the development of treatment preferences with endovascutar repair being preferred to open repair. Nevertheless for patient-centred care, vascular centres must continue to safety provide both open and endovascular repair.

The imperative has therefore shifted from amassing evidence about efficacy to scale-up to maximise population-level health gains. Electronic implementation monitoring, or 'e-monitoring', systems have been designed to assist and track the delivery of preventive policies and programs. However, there is little evidence on whether emonitoring systems improve the dissemination, adoption, and ongoing delivery of evidence-based preventive programs. Also, given considerable difficulties with e-monitoring systems in the clinical sector, scholars have called for a more sophisticated re-examination of e-monitoring's role in enhancing implementation. Methods: In the state of New South Wales ( NSW), Australia, the Population Health Information Management System (PHIMS) was created to support the dissemination of obesity prevention programs to 6000 childcare centres and elementary schools across all 15 local health districts. We have established a three-way university-policymakerpractice research partnership to investigate the impact of PHIMS on practice, how PHIMS is used, and how achievement of key performance indicators of program adoption may be associated with local contextual factors. Our methods encompass ethnographic observation, key informant interviews and participatory workshops for data interpretation at a state and local level. We use an on-line social network analysis of the collaborative relationships across local health district health promotion teams to explore the relationship between PHIMS use and the organisational structure of practice. Discussion: Insights will be sensitised by institutional theory, practice theory and complex adaptive system thinking, among other theories which make sense of socio-technical action. Our working hypothesis is that the science of getting evidence-based programs into practice rests on an in-depth understanding of the role they play in the on-going system of local relationships and multiple accountabilities. Data will be synthesised to produce a typology to characterise local context, PHIMS use and key performance indicator achievement (of program implementation) across the 15 local health districts. Results could be used to continuously align e-monitoring technologies within quality improvement processes to ensure that such technologies enhance practice and innovation. A partnership approach to knowledge production increases the likelihood that findings will be put into practice.

This study demonstrates the necessity for local information on common mental disorder (CMD) and substance use by comparing data from the South East London Community Health (SELCoH) study with those from a national study, the 2007 English Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Study (APMS). Methodology/Principal Findings: Data were used from two cross-sectional surveys, 1698 men and women residing in south London and 7403 men and women in England. The main outcome, CMD, was indicated by a score of 12 or above on the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule. Secondary outcomes included hazardous alcohol use and illicit drug use. SELCoH sample prevalence estimates of CMD were nearly twice that of the APMS England sample estimates. There was a four-fold greater proportion of depressive episode in the SELCoH sample than the APMS sample. The prevalence of hazardous alcohol use was higher in the national sample. Illicit drug use in the past year was higher in the SELCoH sample, with cannabis and cocaine the illicit drugs reported most frequently in both samples. In comparisons of the SELCoH sample with the APMS England sample and the APMS sample from the Greater London area in combined datasets, these differences remained after adjusting for socio-demographic and socioeconomic indicators for all outcomes. Conclusions/Significance: Local information for estimating the prevalence of CMD and substance use is essential for surveillance and service planning. There were similarities in the demographic and socioeconomic factors related to CMD and substance use across samples.

We asked 229 authors who have published recently in the Journal of Applied Ecology (1999-2001) whether their papers made management or policy recommendations and whether they had evidence of consequent uptake. 2. A total of 108 respondents working in the UK (34%). Europe (30%), the Americas (12%), Australasia (11%), Asia (7%) and Africa (6%) reported on I 10 papers. They represented agro-ecosystems (35%), temperate forests or woodlands (16%), savanna, grass or arid lands (11%), rivers or wetlands (10%), estuaries or marine systems (7%) and tropical forests (5%). The major organisms were invertebrates (27%), birds (24%), mammals (21%) and higher plants (21%). Topics apparently under-represented in recent coverage include ecosystem science, urban areas, soils, mountain systems, fish, amphibians and lower organisms such as algae. 3. Almost all papers (99%) carried recommendations and for 57% there was evidence of uptake in the broad categories of 'environmental management or models', 'information, training and education' and 'monitoring and assessment'. Most uptake involved large geographical scales through habitat or species management plans (32% of cases), effects on reserve design or designation (6%), and effects on agri-environmental policy (5%). The development of further research (11%), the communication of methods to other ecologists (9%), the dissemination of recommendations to practitioners or agencies (7%), and uptake in training or education (5%) were important uses of information. 4. Prestige from publication in the Journal of Applied Ecology, aided several authors in convincing end-users of research value. User involvement in research as participants or funders was widespread (>42% of papers), a fact which almost certainly promotes uptake along with the parallel dissemination of management messages. We view applied issues as an important interface between end-users and ecologists of value to 'both' communities but suggest that improved communication will further benefit the sponsorship and application of ecological science. 5. The major reason offered for lack of uptake was that it was still too soon after publication (21% of respondents). Costs, difficulty of implementation, the scale of the problem. and 'challenges to existing thinking' each figured in more than one response. 6. For some respondents, papers were led by curiosity rather than the need for direct application. Several authors published in the Journal to share ideas internationally, or said that recommendations were general, conceptual or long-term rather than specific. of Applied Ecology recognize the seminal importance of The editors of the Journal of Applied Ecology recognize the seminal importance of contributions that affect policy incrementally and conceptually as much as those with specific application. 7. These data provide evidence that ecological science is aiding environmental management and policy across a wide range of regions, ecosystems and types of organisms; rather than merely detecting problems, applied ecology is offering solutions both directly and more diffusely through conceptual advance. We invite the user community to offer their own perspectives about the value of research-led publications such C as this Journal, about how links between researchers and users C 2002 British might be strengthened, Ecological Society and about how the uptake of applied ecology might be further advanced.

In particular, emergency distance learning caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in a lack of motivation and effectiveness in learning. This study designed an online gamified learning activity incorporating multi-representational scaffolding and compared the differences in the learning achievement and motivation for the gamified activity and general synchronous distance learning. In addition, for the group that conducted the gamified learning activity, we measured the participants' flow, anxiety, and emotion during the activity. A total of 36 high school students participated in the experiment. The results indicated that the gamified learning activity was not significantly effective in terms of enhancing learning achievement. In terms of learning motivation, a significant decrease in motivation was found for the group using general synchronous learning, while a significant increase in motivation was found for the group using synchronous gamified learning. This indicates that despite the negative impact of the pandemic on learning, gamified learning still enhances students' learning motivation. The results of flow, anxiety, and emotion showed that the participants had a positive and engaged experience. Participants provided feedback that the multi-representational scaffolding facilitates learning.

Design of online intelligent English teaching platform based on artificial intelligence techniques	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						artificial intelligence education; deep learning; online English teaching platform	DECISION-MAKING; MODEL	Artificial intelligence education (AIEd) is defined in the field of education as the utilization of artificial intelligence. There are currently many AIEd-driven applications in schools and universities. This paper applies an artificial intelligence module combined with the knowledge recommendation to the system and develops an online English teaching system in comparison with the common teaching auxiliary system. The method of English teaching is useful in investigating the potential internal connections between evaluation outcomes and various factors. This article develops deep learning-assisted online intelligent English teaching system that utilizes to create a modern tool platform to help students improve their English language teaching efficiency in line with their mastery of knowledge and personality. The decision tree algorithm and neural networks have been used and to generate an English teaching assessment implementation model based on decision tree technologies. It provides valuable data from extensive information, summarizes rules and data, and helps teachers to improve their education and the English scores of students. This system reflects the thinking of the artificial intelligence expert system. Test application demonstrates that the system can help students improve their learning efficiency and will make learning content more relevant. Besides, the system provides an example model with similar methods and has a referential definition.

In Study One, we observed how the robot's embodiment, accompanied by its sensors and movements, elicited embodied reactions of eleven children (aged 3 to 6) while they played and learned with the robot one-on-one at home and in school. Two distinct patterns emerged: rich multimodal interaction and fluid learning space. Additionally, the children demonstrated extended attention in the interactions and invited peers into voluntary collaboration. In Study Two, we implemented an interaction triad with ten pairs of children, in which each pair collaborated to help a robot, and observed their collaborative communication while they solved problems involving early academic topics. Three embodied phenomena were noted: (i) embodiment of early mathematics and science knowledge and reasoning, (ii) appropriation of physical space, and (iii) embodied collaboration. Importantly, it was clear in both studies that embodiment occurred not only in thinking but also in social and emotional experiences. We discuss the implications of the findings in relation to the potential of humanoid robots for enabling embodied learning experiences.

"I Don't Think Of It As An Illness": Illness Representations in Mild to Moderate Dementia	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Aging; awareness; coping behavior; dementia; diagnosis; psychological adjustment	EARLY-STAGE DEMENTIA; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; AWARENESS; PEOPLE; MODEL; SENSE; PERCEPTIONS; CAREGIVERS; DIAGNOSIS; IMPACT	The self-regulatory model proposes that illness representations influence adjustment and coping in chronic conditions. Better understanding of the illness representations held by people with dementia could help with targeting information and support so as to optimize adjustment and coping. In this mixed-methods study of illness representations among people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's, vascular, or mixed dementia we aimed to clarify the nature of the representations held, to determine whether specific profiles can be identified based on perceptions of the identity and cause of the condition, and to examine associations between these profiles and other participant characteristics. Data were collected in the second wave of the Memory Impairment and Dementia Awareness Study (MIDAS). Sixty-four people with dementia, who had been told their diagnosis at a memory clinic, completed interviews and responded to questionnaires. In each case a carer was also interviewed. Cluster analysis based on responses about identity and cause identified three profiles. 'Illness' cluster participants saw themselves as living with an illness and used diagnostic labels, 'ageing' cluster participants did not use diagnostic labels and viewed their difficulties as related to ageing, and 'no problem' cluster participants considered that they did not have any difficulties. 'Illness' cluster participants had better cognition and better awareness, but lower mood, and perceived more practical consequences, than 'ageing' cluster participants. Holding an 'illness' model may not be advantageous. Rather than encouraging adoption of such a model, it may be preferable to target information and select interventions in line with the person's representation profile.

The cognitive miserliness hypothesis proposes that people often respond incorrectly on CRT items because of an unwillingness to go beyond default, heuristic processing and invest time and effort in analytic, reflective processing. Our analysis (N = 391) focused on people's response times to CRT items to determine whether predicted associations are evident between miserly thinking and the generation of incorrect, intuitive answers. Evidence indicated only a weak correlation between CRT response times and accuracy. Item-level analyses also failed to demonstrate predicted response-time differences between correct analytic and incorrect intuitive answers for two of the three CRT items. We question whether participants who give incorrect intuitive answers on the CRT can legitimately be termed cognitive misers and whether the three CRT items measure the same general construct.

Corvita(R)-reinforced grafts, with walls made of poly(carbonate urethane) (PCU) filaments, displayed a relatively thin, uniform and partially endothelialized inner capsule with good tissue in-growth. The external polyester mesh separated from the underlying PCU wall due to the degradation of the melt adhesive between these two layers. Three types of Thoratec(R) access graft exhibited a high degree of thrombus and little tissue in-growth, and were non-adhesive to both the inner and external capsules as the solid layer beneath their lumens completely blocked any transmural communication. The microporous poly(ether urethane urea) degraded extensively. Pulse-Tec(R) grafts at one month also demonstrated non-adhesive properties because the external skin served as a barrier to tissue in-growth. At 6 months, its poly(ether urethane) wall displayed the most severe degradation, damaging graft structural integrity and causing significant tissue deposition in the degradation areas. This study shows the importance of multiple factors in vascular prosthesis design and demonstrates that collective and comprehensive thinking will be key in the future development of creative and novel approaches.

Mercedes; Llorens-Montes, Francisco Javier			IT vendor integration as catalyst of IT outsourcing success	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING			English	Article; Early Access						Transformational outsourcing; ITO; Outsourcing catalyst; Outsourcing success; Vendor integration; Information sharing; Vendor proficiency; Ex-ante trust; Blended ITO	SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATION; INTENSIVE BUSINESS SERVICES; VALUE CO-CREATION; EXTERNAL INTEGRATION; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIPS; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; VERTICAL INTEGRATION; PARTNERSHIP QUALITY	PurposeThis paper aims to explain how small- and medium-sized firms (SMEs) create information technology (IT) business value through blended IT outsourcing (ITO). The explanatory framework it proposes enables SMEs to replicate IT capability outcomes (i.e. enhance their economic, strategic and technological competences, namely, ITO success) by endorsing an ITO strategy catalyzed by IT vendor integration. Design/methodology/approachThis study uses covariance-based structural equation modeling to test the proposed research model. Data are collected from 251 knowledge-intensive business SMEs located in Science and Technology Parks in Spain. FindingsThe results demonstrate empirically that SMEs can replicate IT capability benefits (i.e. enhance their non-IT competences) through blended ITO in which IT, conceptualized as a transversal supporting activity, is outsourced to an IT vendor while the value creation process remains with the buyer. The integration (i.e. process integration and information sharing) of an IT-proficient vendor catalyzes ITO success. More specifically, the results show that, although process integration is not directly related to competence enhancement, fosters information sharing, which directly facilitates ITO success. The results also show that IT vendor proficiency accounts for ex ante trust. Practical implicationsManagers should think of transformational ITO as a strategy to enhance firm competences. For blended ITO strategies to succeed, managers must have a comprehensive understanding of the business they run, as it is important to create conditions that foster inter-firm information sharing. To achieve these conditions, managers should take special care in selecting boundary spanners, who are the pivotal links in competence enhancement. Originality/valueWhile most research focuses on ongoing trust (i.e. trust develops as ITO evolves), this study focuses on initial (i.e. ex ante) trust and analyzes IT vendor proficiency (expert, experienced and reputed) to examine trust as an antecedent of ITO. This study also draws on previous conceptualizations of vendor integration to develop and analyze a two-step integration model to explain how IT vendor integration (i.e. process integration and information sharing) catalyzes enhancement of the buyer's non-IT competences. This study focuses on SMEs, which are often neglected in ITO studies.	[Navarro-Paule, Andres J.; Romerosa-Martinez, M.

J	Bryanov, K; Vziatysheva, V				Bryanov, Kirill; Vziatysheva, Victoria			Determinants of individuals' belief in fake news: A scoping review determinants of belief in fake news	PLOS ONE			English	Review							SOCIAL MEDIA; FALSE NEWS; SCIENCE; MISINFORMATION; CREDIBILITY; WEB; SUSCEPTIBILITY; COVERAGE; RATINGS; SCOPUS	Background Proliferation of misinformation in digital news environments can harm society in a number of ways, but its dangers are most acute when citizens believe that false news is factually accurate. A recent wave of empirical research focuses on factors that explain why people fall for the so-called fake news. In this scoping review, we summarize the results of experimental studies that test different predictors of individuals' belief in misinformation. Methods The review is based on a synthetic analysis of 26 scholarly articles. The authors developed and applied a search protocol to two academic databases, Scopus and Web of Science. The sample included experimental studies that test factors influencing users' ability to recognize fake news, their likelihood to trust it or intention to engage with such content. Relying on scoping review methodology, the authors then collated and summarized the available evidence. Results The study identifies three broad groups of factors contributing to individuals' belief in fake news. Firstly, message characteristics-such as belief consistency and presentation cues-can drive people's belief in misinformation. Secondly, susceptibility to fake news can be determined by individual factors including people's cognitive styles, predispositions, and differences in news and information literacy. Finally, accuracy-promoting interventions such as warnings or nudges priming individuals to think about information veracity can impact judgements about fake news credibility. Evidence suggests that inoculation-type interventions can be both scalable and effective. We note that study results could be partly driven by design choices such as selection of stimuli and outcome measurement. Conclusions We call for expanding the scope and diversifying designs of empirical investigations of people's susceptibility to false information online. We recommend examining digital platforms beyond Facebook, using more diverse formats of stimulus material and adding a comparative angle to fake news research.

Design: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and quasi-experiment. Data sources: Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, WANFANG, and CNKI were searched for eligible articles published in English and Chinese until May 28, 2021. Review methods: The Quality Appraisal Check-list for Quantitative Intervention Studies was applied to the quality evaluation. Standard mean differences (SMD) were pooled using a random effects model. The results of the individual and combined intervention effects estimation of was displayed in a forest plot, with weight, SMD, its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), Z-test, p, I-2. Results: Thirty-eight studies were included and 37 were analyzed. High-fidelity simulation (HFS) revealed significantly larger effect sizes for knowledge (SMD = 0.89, 95% CI [0.54 to 1.23]), skill (SMD = 0.93, 95% CI [0.69 to 1.17]), collaboration (SMD = 0.52, 95% CI [0.26 to 0.78]), caring (SMD = 1.40, 95% CI [0.23 to 2.58]) and learning interest (SMD = 0.85, 95% CI [0.00 to 2.04]) when compared with other teaching methods. However, no significant difference between HFS and other teaching methods in critical thinking (SMD = 0.46, 95% CI [-1.12 to 1.58]), self-confidence (SMD = 0.22, 95% CI [-0.32 to 0.75]) and learning satisfaction (SMD = 0.58, 95% CI [-0.25 to 1.41]) was shown. Conclusions: High-fidelity simulation (HFS) can more effectively cultivate knowledge, skills, collaboration, caring, and learning interest of undergraduate nursing students. Since the effect of HFS is equivalent to other teaching methods in cultivating undergraduate nursing students' critical thinking, self-confidence and learning satisfaction, nursing educators can choose the most appropriate methods to achieve the intended learning outcomes according to the actual situation.

We developed a psychiatric knowledge-based clinical decision support system (Psy-KBCDSS), which may aid nurses in solving patients' problems in the psychiatric department. In addition, we compared the sensitivity and specificity for the nursing diagnoses between the psychiatric nursing process system (Psy-NPS) and Psy-KBCDSS to determine that the Psy-KBCDSS can assist nurses in performing the nursing assessment and diagnosis. Methods: Visual Studio 2019 was adopted as the primary software development tool, and C# as the main development language. The concept of the nursing process was applied to develop the Psy-KBCDSS user interface. We developed a clinical diagnostic validity inference engine to calculate the frequencies of the nursing assessment items and nursing diagnoses in clinical tasks in the Psy-NPS for generating a knowledge-based database of the Psy-KBCDSS. The sensitivity and specificity for nursing diagnoses formulated by senior and junior nurses were used to determining the effectiveness of adopting Psy-NPS and Psy-KBCDSS. Results: This study include 22 nursing diagnoses commonly encountered in psychiatric wards. The top eight most common diagnoses in the Psy-NPS and Psy-KBCDSS were altered thought processes, ineffective coping, sensory and perceptual alterations, insomnia, risk for other-directed violence, anxiety, impaired social interaction, and risk for suicide. Compared with the Psy-NPS, the Psy-KBCDSS had significantly higher sensitivity for sensory and perceptual alterations, ineffective coping, and insomnia and significantly higher specificity for ineffective coping. Conclusions: Considering its high sensitivity and specificity for various nursing diagnoses, the PsyKBCDSS, as an empirical patient-oriented nursing clinical decision-making support system, can assist nurses in clinical nursing tasks including nursing process-based patient assessment and nursing diagnosis.

Measuring team factors thought to influence the success of quality improvement in primary care: a systematic review of instruments	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Review						Continuous quality improvement; Primary care; Evaluation; Systematic review; Measurement; Instrument; Conceptual framework; Taxonomy; Teamwork; Team functioning	GROUP DECISION-MAKING; HEALTH-CARE; INTENSIVE-CARE; ORGANIZATIONAL ASSESSMENT; PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY; WORK; MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION; LEADERSHIP	Background: Measuring team factors in evaluations of Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) may provide important information for enhancing CQI processes and outcomes; however, the large number of potentially relevant factors and associated measurement instruments makes inclusion of such measures challenging. This review aims to provide guidance on the selection of instruments for measuring team-level factors by systematically collating, categorizing, and reviewing quantitative self-report instruments. Methods: Data sources: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Health and Psychosocial Instruments; reference lists of systematic reviews; and citations and references of the main report of instruments. Study selection: To determine the scope of the review, we developed and used a conceptual framework designed to capture factors relevant to evaluating CQI in primary care (the InQuIRe framework). We included papers reporting development or use of an instrument measuring factors relevant to teamwork. Data extracted included instrument purpose; theoretical basis, constructs measured and definitions; development methods and assessment of measurement properties. Analysis and synthesis: We used qualitative analysis of instrument content and our initial framework to develop a taxonomy for summarizing and comparing instruments. Instrument content was categorized using the taxonomy, illustrating coverage of the InQuIRe framework. Methods of development and evidence of measurement properties were reviewed for instruments with potential for use in primary care. Results: We identified 192 potentially relevant instruments, 170 of which were analyzed to develop the taxonomy. Eighty-one instruments measured constructs relevant to CQI teams in primary care, with content covering teamwork context (45 instruments measured enabling conditions or attitudes to teamwork), team process (57 instruments measured teamwork behaviors), and team outcomes (59 instruments measured perceptions of the team or its effectiveness). Forty instruments were included for full review, many with a strong theoretical basis. Evidence supporting measurement properties was limited. Conclusions: Existing instruments cover many of the factors hypothesized to contribute to QI success. With further testing, use of these instruments measuring team factors in evaluations could aid our understanding of the influence of teamwork on CQI outcomes. Greater consistency in the factors measured and choice of measurement instruments is required to enable synthesis of findings for informing policy and practice.

Environmental and agronomic issues require always more well thought and suited farmer management of agricultural inputs; soil analysis is therefore an essential tool to support decision. However, for a soil analysis to provide valuable information, it is essential for the sample to be representative of the studied field. Without this representativeness, an analytical result, as accurate as it could be, would not be of interest if it could mislead the farmer. In practice, the main difficulty for the sampler is the recognition of soil criteria which are essential to provide a fertility advice, especially in Wallonia (Belgium) where soil variability is very important. With the Digital Soil Map of Wallonia (DSMW), drowned at the scale 1/5,000, it seems appropriate to give these information to the samplers in an useful form for routine works. That is why a mapping tool for decision support, named REQUACARTO, was designed to be used for soil analysis by provincial laboratories, members of the REQUASUD laboratories network. This tool responds to a real requirement in Wallonia: achieving a quality sampling for the development of personalized soil fertility advice.

The multi-factorial contributors to persistent pain are often overlooked during treatment. Pain neuroscience education (PNE) contributes to a holistic approach for patients with persistent pain but has not yet been researched for patients with RCRSP.Objective: To explore the perspectives and experiences of participants with RCRSP who had completed a pro-gramme of PNE-informed pragmatic physiotherapy.Design: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. Methods: We included a sub-group of five males and five females, aged 46-75 years, with persistent RCRSP of at least three months. They had undertaken a three-month pragmatic physiotherapy integrated with PNE. Indi-vidual semi-structured interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using the General Inductive Approach.Results: Four themes emanated from the interviews. The first two themes were named 'Patient Beliefs' and overall 'Rapport and Relationship'. Another theme, 'Perspective and Understanding of the Resources', indicated diverse uptake of the resource information. The participants reported developing self-management skills, active coping strategies and a reduction in fear of pain described by the theme: 'Empowerment: My Shoulder into the Future'.Conclusions: Participants experienced a change in their beliefs, which were enhanced by an individualised de-livery and a strong therapeutic relationship through the course of the physiotherapy care. The participants appeared to value when the physiotherapist listened to and understood their beliefs. This required a shift in the patient-therapist relationship from the physiotherapist being the 'expert' to facilitating the patient's ability to take control of their shoulder health.

While various systems exist, students have difficulty with deep processing of complex instructional materials (e.g., concepts of a theory and pedagogical support mechanisms derived from a theory). This research proposes a theoretical framework that leverages attention guidance in a social constructivist approach to facilitate processing of central domain concepts, principles, and their interrelations. Using an open source anchored discussion system, we designed a set of instructor-based and peer-oriented attention guidance functionalities involving dynamic manipulation of text font size similar to tag clouds. We conducted an experimental study with two small groups of first-year doctoral students in a blended-learning classroom format. Students in the control group had no access to attention guidance functions. Students in the treatment group used instructor-based attention guidance functionality and then switched to peer-oriented attention guidance functionality. The evaluation compared focus, content, and sequential organization of students' online discussion messages with heat maps, content analysis, sequential analysis, and statistical discourse analysis to examine different facets of the phenomenon in a holistic way. The results show that in areas where students struggle to understand challenging concepts, instructor-based attention guidance functionality facilitated elaboration and negotiation of ideas, which is fundamental to higher order thinking. In addition, after switching to peer-oriented attention guidance functionality, students in the treatment group took the lead in pinpointing challenging concepts they did not previously understand. These findings indicate that instructor-based and peer-oriented attention guidance functionalities offer students an indirect way of focusing their attention on deep processing of challenging concepts in an inherently open learning environment. Implications for theory, software design, and future research are discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Criswell, B				Criswell, Brett			Framing Inquiry in High School Chemistry: Helping Students See the Bigger Picture	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						High School/Introductory Chemistry; Inquiry-Based/Discovery Learning; Learning Theories	SCIENCE; EDUCATION	Inquiry has been advocated as an effective pedagogical strategy for promoting deep conceptual understanding and more sophisticated scientific thinking by numerous bodies associated with chemistry (and science) education. To allow inquiry to achieve these goals, the teacher must manage the amount of cognitive load experienced by students while they engage in inquiry activities. This article can help teachers address that challenge by discussing the notion of framing (a form of scaffolding) and by presenting a model designed to help teachers more effectively frame inquiry activities. Using the metaphor of a picture frame, the model introduces five components of the framing process that can be employed by teachers as guidelines for developing the background information they will share with students prior to an inquiry activity. Those components are context, goals, actions, tools, and interactions. Providing students with such a carefully developed background can better orient them to the purpose of the inquiry activity, put boundaries on the problem space they will be exploring, and reduce the cognitive load as they engage in the activity, all of which should improve the inquiry learning experience.

The response associated with each alternative has been measured using 43 indicators considering all stages of the life cycle. A decision-making model is carried out on the basis of a neutrosophic group analytical hierarchy process (NAHP-G) capturing the maximum information in terms of credibility, inconsistency and indetermination. The 9 criteria on which an expert group intervenes are finally evaluated using VIKOR. The results show that non-probabilistic uncertainties influence the weights obtained, with maximum deviations in the criteria between 11.91% and 4.95%, if compared to conventional AHP. From the methodology it is obtained that the technological alternative with non-conventional concrete performs best in sustainable terms. Although the industrialized option has less environmental impact, only the simultaneous consideration of the economic, environmental and social pillars in a project will lead to appropriate sustainable designs.

J	Buchanan, T				Buchanan, Tom			Why do people spread false information online? The effects of message and viewer characteristics on self-reported likelihood of sharing social media disinformation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; FAKE NEWS	Individuals who encounter false information on social media may actively spread it further, by sharing or otherwise engaging with it. Much of the spread of disinformation can thus be attributed to human action. Four studies (totalN= 2,634) explored the effect of message attributes (authoritativeness of source, consensus indicators), viewer characteristics (digital literacy, personality, and demographic variables) and their interaction (consistency between message and recipient beliefs) on self-reported likelihood of spreading examples of disinformation. Participants also reported whether they had shared real-world disinformation in the past. Reported likelihood of sharing was not influenced by authoritativeness of the source of the material, nor indicators of how many other people had previously engaged with it. Participants' level of digital literacy had little effect on their responses. The people reporting the greatest likelihood of sharing disinformation were those who thought it likely to be true, or who had pre-existing attitudes consistent with it. They were likely to have previous familiarity with the materials. Across the four studies, personality (lower Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, higher Extraversion and Neuroticism) and demographic variables (male gender, lower age and lower education) were weakly and inconsistently associated with self-reported likelihood of sharing. These findings have implications for strategies more or less likely to work in countering disinformation in social media.

A comparison of evidence grading	BJOG-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY			English	Review						Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment; graphic display; guidelines; tocolytic effectiveness		BackgroundEvidence summaries of tocolytic effectiveness assign quality levels based on a single dimension: the study design. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system takes into account several domains, including limitations of the study design and ranking the importance of outcomes. ObjectivesThe aim of the study was to compare the quality of evidence according to GRADE with the quality as described by existing guidelines. Search strategyA practitioner survey to rank the importance of outcomes and a systematic review were conducted. For the systematic review, we searched Medline, Embase, and DARE databases from inception to December 2010 using the terms tocolytics' and threatened preterm labour', without any language restrictions. Selection criteriaInclusion criteria for the review were randomised controlled trials comparing tocolytics with either placebo or betamimetics. Data collection and analysisThe review and survey teams worked independently. Evidence ratings according to GRADE were performed. Main resultsThe majority of the survey respondents thought that it was important to use tocolytics to buy the time needed for steroids to promote fetal lung maturation and to allow in utero transfer. Nearly 80% of high' ratings in guidelines were downgraded as a result of deficiencies identified by GRADE. Authors' conclusionsWe propose a move away from the use of evidence rating systems reliant solely on study design, as they have a propensity towards strong recommendations when the underlying evidence is weak.

We conducted a crossover design experiment in which similar groups of introductory biology students were assigned verbatim questions in the MC format or multiple-true-false (MTF) format, which requires students to separately evaluate each option as either true or false. Our data reveal that nearly half of the students who select the correct MC answer likely hold incorrect understandings of the other options and that the selection rates for individual MC options provide inaccurate estimations of how many students separately endorse each option. These results suggest that MC questions systematically overestimate question mastery and underestimate the prevalence of mixed and partial conceptions, whereas MTF questions enable students and instructors to gain a more nuanced portrait of student thinking with little additional effort.

Two alternative hypotheses were tested to determine the nature of the associations between trait anxiety, attentional bias to negative information, and intrusion vulnerability.Methods: Intrusions were elicited using the trauma film paradigm, and post-event attentional bias to negative information was assessed using the dot-probe task. Participants then completed a week-long intrusions diary.esults: Results showed that attentional bias to negative information mediated the effect of heightened trait anxiety on elevated intrusion frequency. It was also revealed that heightened trait anxiety was associated with elevated intrusion-related distress, though attentional bias to negative information did not mediate this relationship. Limitations: Our sample was comprised of undergraduate students who were not selected based on a previous pathology. Replication in clinical samples is warranted.Conclusions: These findings provide new insight regarding individual differences in the experience of intrusions and suggest that both the frequency and distress associated with intrusions could represent clinical targets.

J	Ye, XQ; Liu, D				Ye, Xiaoqing; Liu, Dun			An interpretable sequential three-way recommendation based on collaborative topic regression	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Granular computing; Sequential three-way decisions; Cost-sensitive learning; Recommendation systems; Multilevel recommendation information		Owing to the imbalance of observed data and user's preference, it is necessary and meaningful to think over the multilevel characteristics of recommendation information (RI) during the recommendation process. At the same time, to better summarize user's preference and enhance user's beliefs, the interpretability of recommendation results also become more and more important in recommender system (RS). In view of the multilevel characteristics of RI and the interpretability of recommendation results, this paper proposes a novel interpretable sequential three-way recommendation strategy, namely, CTR-based cost-sensitive sequential three-way recommendation (CTR-CS3WR). First, in order to construct the interpretable granular features and multilevel information, we introduce collaborative topic regression (CTR) and design three novel granulation methods: PMF-based, LDA-based and CTR-based granulation method.

However, less is known about the processes through which ACE are linked to multiple negative outcomes. The aim of the FACE epidemiological study is to investigate emotion regulation (emotional reactivity, perseverative thinking and self-efficacy for managing emotions) and social information processing (rejection sensitivity, interpretation biases and social understanding) as potential mechanisms linking adverse childhood experiences and psychosocial functioning in a large population sample of young adults. It is embedded in a larger project that also includes an ecological momentary assessment of emotion regulation and social information processing and informs the development and evaluation of an online self-help intervention for young adults with a history of ACE. Methods The study plans to recruit 5000 young adults aged 18 to 21 from the German-speaking Swiss population. Addresses are provided by Swiss Federal Statistical Office and participants are invited by mail to complete a self-report online survey. If the targeted sample size will not be reached, a second additional sample will be recruited via educational facilities such as universities or teacher training colleges or military training schools. Three follow-ups are planned after 1 year, 2 years and 3 years, resulting in ages 18-24 being covered. The main exposure variable is self-reported adverse childhood experiences before the age of 18, measured at the baseline. Primary outcomes are psychosocial functioning across the study period. Secondary outcomes are social information processing, emotion regulation and health care service use. Statistical analyses include a range of latent variable models to identify patterns of adverse childhood experiences and patterns and trajectories of psychosocial adaptation. Discussion The results will contribute to the understanding of the underlying mechanisms that link ACE with psychosocial functioning which is crucial for an improved insight into risk and resilience processes and for tailoring interventions. Furthermore, the identification of factors that facilitate or hinder service use among young adults with ACE informs healthcare policies and the provision of appropriate healthcare services. Trial registration number: NCT05122988. The study was reviewed and authorized by the ethical committee of Northwestern and Central Switzerland (BASEC number 2021-01204).

At the same time, to better summarize user's preference and enhance user's beliefs, the interpretability of recommendation results also become more and more important in recommender system (RS). In view of the multilevel characteristics of RI and the interpretability of recommendation results, this paper proposes a novel interpretable sequential three-way recommendation strategy, namely, CTR-based cost-sensitive sequential three-way recommendation (CTR-CS3WR). First, in order to construct the interpretable granular features and multilevel information, we introduce collaborative topic regression (CTR) and design three novel granulation methods: PMF-based, LDA-based and CTR-based granulation method.

This is particularly salient in the disciplines of both history and data science. Our approach to helping students build expertise with complex information leverages activity theory to think about the design of a classroom activity system integrated with the design of a collaborative open-source network-analysis software tool called Net.Create. Through analysis of network log data as well as video data of students' collaborative interactions with Net.Create, we explore how our activity system helped students reconcile common contradictions that create barriers to dealing with complex datasets in large lecture classrooms. Findings show that as students draw on details in a historical text to collaboratively construct a larger network, they begin to move more readily between small detail and aggregate overview. Students at both high and low initial skill levels were able to increase the complexity of their historical analyses through their engagement with the Net.Create tool and activities. Net.Create transforms the limitation of large class sizes in history classrooms into a resource for students' collaborative knowledge building, and through collaborative data entry it supports the historiographic practices of citation and revision and helps students embed local historical actors into a larger historical context.

JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE			English	Article						distance perception; effort; perceptual scaling; intention	PERCEIVING DISTANCE; GEOGRAPHICAL SLANT; SIZE; RECALIBRATION	This research was designed to test the predictions of 2 approaches to perception. By most traditional accounts, people are thought to derive general-purpose spatial perceptions that are scaled in arbitrary, unspecified units. In contrast, action-specific approaches propose that the angular information inherent in optic flow and ocular motor adjustments is rescaled and transformed into units related to intended actions. A number of studies have shown, for example, that the apparent distance to targets is scaled by the effort required to walk the extent. Such studies can be accommodated by the traditional account by asserting that the experimental manipulations of walking effort influenced not perception itself, but rather postperceptual response processes. The current studies were designed to assess when and how action-specific influences on distance perception have their effects. The results supported the action-specific account.

The reader as subjective entropy: a novel analysis of multimodal readability	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Transinformation analysis; Information theory; Entropy; Multimodal readability	UNCERTAINTY	Purpose The purpose of this study was to explore the viability of transinformation analysis as a multimodal readability metric. A novel approach was called for, considering that existing and established readability metrics are strictly used to measure linguistic complexity. Yet, the corpus of multimodal literature continues to grow, along with the need to understand how non-linguistic modalities contribute to the complexity of the reading experience. Design/methodology/approach In this exploratory study, think aloud screen recordings of eighth-grade readers of the born-digital novel Inanimate Alice were analyzed for complexity, along with transcripts of post-oral retellings. Pixel-level entropy analysis served as both an objective measure of the document and a subjective measure of the amount of reader information attention. Post-oral retelling entropy was calculated at the unit level of the word, serving as an indication of complexity in recall. Findings Findings confirmed that transinformation analysis is a viable multimodal readability metric. Inanimate Alice is an objectively complex document, creating a subjectively complex reading experience for the participants. Readers largely attended to the linguistic mode of the story, effectively reducing the amount of information they processed. This was also evident in the brevity and below average complexity of their post-oral retellings, which relied on recall of the linguistic mode. There were no significant group differences among the readers. Originality/value This is the first study that uses entropy to analyze multimodal readability.

The CSI is based on constraint and maximization indicators. Constraint indicators assess whether a city meets the necessary minimum conditions for city sustainability. Maximization indicators measure the benefits that a city generates in socio-economic aspects. When used in the policy-making process, the choice of constraint indicators should be implemented using a top-down approach. In contrast, a bottom-up approach is more suitable for defining maximization indicators because this technique involves multiple stakeholders (in a transdisciplinary approach). Using different materials of various colors, shapes, sizes, we designed and constructed the visualized physical model of the CSI to help people evaluate and compare the performance of different cities in terms of sustainability. The visualized model of the CSI can convey complicated information in a simple and straightforward manner to diverse stakeholders so that the sustainability analysis can be understood intuitively by ordinary citizens as well as experts. Thus, the CSI model helps stakeholders to develop critical thinking about city sustainability and enables policymakers to make informed decisions for sustainability through a transdisciplinary approach.

J	von Krogh, G; Nåden, D				von Krogh, Gunn; Naden, Dagfinn			The use of hermeneutic interpretation statements in EPR documentation to capture qualities of caring	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						documentation; electronic patient record; hermeneutics; nursing	CARE; SCIENCE; MODEL	Aims and objectives. To present an examination of hermeneutic interpretations statements in documentation; occurrences, nature and significant patterns, before and after the implementation of an electronic patient record and the documentation model quality assurance, problem solving and caring. Background. The problem-solving and caring model facilitates the systematisation and formatting of nursing documenting in electronic patient record. Text formats are designed for record notes to indicate how the text is to be presented and organised. A narrative text format is designed to facilitate a caring perspective in nursing report notes. This format allows the inclusion of hermeneutic interpretations statements to visualise the understanding of the patient. Design. Documentation material was examined in a pretest-post-test design. Method. Report notes were analysed with the aid of Gadamer's hermeneutic interpretation process. The horizon of interpretation was formed by qualities of caring described in caring philosophy and caring theory. Results. One hundred and six reports containing hermeneutic interpretation statements reflecting caring were identified. The finding shows that the number of such information is small and decreases during the project. Conclusion. The result may indicate that hermeneutic interpretation statements in documentation may diminish with the introduction of electronic patient records. This can lead to incomplete information exchange if face-to-face reporting is discontinued. For that reason, electronic patient records need an information structure facilitating information formatted to reflect caring. The use of such a format requires training to a larger extent that was offered during this project. Relevance to clinical practice. This study might enhance the clinician's awareness of materialising both analytical and hermeneutical thinking processes in clinical reasoning when documenting nursing care. New documentation tools and routines might favour documentation based on analytical thinking processes with the consequence that essential information of importance for the individual patient's care might be lost.

Secondarily to determine variables associated with intra-abdominal hypertension and ICU mortality. Design: A prospective observational study. Setting: Single institution trauma, medical and surgical ICU in Canada. Patients: Consecutive adult patients admitted to the ICU (n = 285). Intervention: Intra-abdominal pressure measurements twice a day during admission to the ICU. Measurements and Main Results: In 285 patients who met inclusion criteria, 30% were diagnosed with intra-abdominal hypertension at admission and a further 15% developed intra-abdominal hypertension during admission. The prevalence of abdominal compartment syndrome was 3%. Obesity, sepsis, mechanical ventilation, and 24-hour fluid balance (> 3 L) were all independent predictors for intra-abdominal hypertension. Intra-abdominal hypertension occurred in 28% of nonventilated patients. Admission type (medical vs surgical vs trauma) was not a significant predictor of intra-abdominal hypertension. Overall ICU mortality was 20% and was significantly higher for patients with intra-abdominal hypertension (30%) compared with patients without intra-abdominal hypertension (11%). Intra-abdominal hypertension of any grade was an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.46-7.57). Conclusions: Intra-abdominal hypertension is common in both surgical and nonsurgical patients in the intensive care setting and was found to be independently associated with mortality. Despite prior reports to the contrary, intra-abdominal hypertension develops in nonventilated patients and in patients who do not have intra-abdominal hypertension at admission. Intra-abdominal pressure monitoring is inexpensive, provides valuable clinical information, and there may be a role for its routine measurement in the ICU. Future work should evaluate the impact of early interventions for patients with intra-abdominal hypertension.

Specifically, it has been shown that people with schizophrenia have an impairment in creative performance. However, little is known about the brain correlates underlying this impairment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze whole brain white matter (WM) correlates of several creativity dimensions in people with schizophrenia. Fifty-five patients with schizophrenia underwent diffusion-weighted imaging on a 3T magnetic resonance imaging machine as well as a clinical and a creativity assessment, including verbal and figural creativity measures. Tract-based spatial statistic, implemented in FMRIB Software Library (FSL), was used to assess whole brain WM correlates with different creativity dimensions, controlling for sex, age, premorbid IQ, and medication. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) in frontal, temporal, subcortical, brain stem, and interhemispheric regions correlated positively with figural originality. The most significant clusters included the right corticospinal tract (cerebral peduncle part) and the right body of the corpus callosum. Verbal creativity did not show any significant correlation. As a whole, these findings suggest that widespread WM integrity is involved in creative performance of patients with schizophrenia. Many of these areas have also been related to creativity in healthy people. In addition, some of these regions have shown to be particularly impaired in schizophrenia, suggesting that these WM alterations could be underlying the worse creative performance found in this pathology.

Carnivorous plants derive nutrients by trapping animals, but unlike most other predators, they lack mobility and are thought to attract prey through a combination of visual and olfactory cues. As part of a semester-long undergraduate research project for a junior/senior-level plant ecology class, students used carnivorous plants and artificial traps to test the importance of visual cues in the capture of wild-type and visually impaired (w(1118)) Drosophila melanogaster. Over the 13-week semester, students worked in groups to generate questions, design experiments, analyze data, and present results both orally and in a written manuscript. A major focus was developing students' ability to compare their results with the literature. Upon completion, manuscripts were uploaded to a digital archive for use by future students in designing projects. This database of readily accessible past projects provides students with an accessible literature base that enables them to build upon previous work in a way that more accurately reflects real-world research.

Disc cell viability was analyzed in relation to nutrient supply and cellular demand in vitro in a diffusion chamber. Objective. To determine relations among nutrient supply, nutrient concentrations, and cell viability. Summary of Background Data. Although a fall in nutrient supply has long been thought the cause of disc degeneration in vivo, little information exists about the effects of nutrient levels or supply on cell viability and metabolism. Methods. Isolated bovine nucleus cells were cultured in agarose gels in a diffusion chamber up to 13 days. Nutrients were supplied to the open sides of the chamber and diffused through the gel to the center, 12.5 mm away from the nutrient supply, in a configuration analogous to that of the disc in vivo. Profiles of cell viability and concentration of glycosaminoglycans across the chamber were measured in relation to cell density and medium composition. Results. Cells remained viable across the chamber at low cell densities. However, at higher densities, cells in the center of the chamber died. The viable distance from the nutrient supply fell with an increase in cell density. Glucose was a critical nutrient. Survival was also poor at acidic pH (6.0). At 0% oxygen, disc cells survived up to 13 days with no loss of viability, but produced very little proteoglycan. Conclusions. The results support the idea that maximum cell density in the disc is regulated by nutritional constraints, and that a fall in nutrient supply reduces the number of viable cells in the disc and thus leads to degeneration.

MANUAL THERAPY			English	Article						user's views; mass media; non-specific low back pain	POPULATION-BASED INTERVENTION; BELIEFS; MANAGEMENT; DISABILITY; CAMPAIGNS; MEDICINE	The study sought to identify and explore the opinions, beliefs and views of members of the public regarding the use of media interventions for the delivery of health-care messages. It used a draft back pain campaign looking at the level of credibility, acceptability and trust in the authority of these messages. Sixty-eight members of the public participated in the study. A qualitative study design was used with semi-structured focus groups and a sampling frame including gender, age, socio-economic group, and experience of back pain. Three main themes were identified. 1. Media consumption. 2. Credibility. 3. Specific issues surrounding the proposed sample media campaign. The use of media to provide health-care information was viewed positively, with the NHS perceived as the most trustworthy source, and Government bodies viewed with scepticism. Issues surrounding the language, terminology and tone of campaigns were raised. A closer collaboration between health-care professionals and the public is advocated to achieve valuable and effective media campaigns. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jones, S				Jones, Simon			Doing social network ethics: a critical, interdisciplinary approach	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & PEOPLE			English	Article						Ethics; Surveillance; Legal aspects of IT; Socio-technical theory; Practice; Power; Social network analysis; Privacy	COMPUTER ETHICS; BIG DATA; PRIVACY; SITES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose an inter-disciplinary approach to the ethics of social networking services (SNS) that connects critical analysis with the doing of ethics in terms of both pedagogic and technological practice. Design/methodology/approach - Primarily conceptual and discursive, drawing on theoretical concepts from a broad, inter-disciplinary field. These concepts are integrated into a multi-dimensional framework that proceeds through four sequential stages: socio-economic, ethical, legal and practical/professional. Particular instances of SNS are used as illustrative examples. Findings - The evaluation of ethical issues can be enriched by broader, holistic approaches that take account of the socio-economic, technical and legal contexts in which SNS technologies are designed, deployed and used. Inter-disciplinary approaches have the potential to generate new connections and possibilities for both the teaching and the professional practice of ethics. Practical implications - Applied ethics are used to consider practical solutions that explore regulatory measures and envision alternative models of social networking. The approach proposed has practical value for teachers and students of computer ethics, as well as for IT practitioners. Originality/value - This paper synthesises elements from media, communication and cultural studies, science and technology, information systems and computer science. The paper offers a strategy of inquiry to understand various aspects of SNS ethics - legal, socio-economic and technical. It presents a methodology for thinking about and doing ethics which can be used by IT practitioners.

J	Banker, RD; Davis, GB; Slaughter, SA				Banker, RD; Davis, GB; Slaughter, SA			Software development practices, software complexity, and software maintenance performance: A field study	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						software maintenance; software complexity; software productivity; software quality; software economics; software metrics; management of computing and information systems	TASK COMPLEXITY; PRODUCTIVITY; SCIENCE; METRICS	Software maintenance claims a large proportion of organizational resources. It is thought that many maintenance problems derive from inadequate software design and development practices. Poor design choices can result in complex software that is costly to support and difficult to change. However, it is difficult to assess the actual maintenance performance effects of software development practices because their impact is realized over the software life cycle. To estimate the impact of development activities in a more practical time frame, this research develops a two-stage model in which software complexity is a key intermediate variable that links design and development decisions to their downstream effects on software maintenance. The research analyzes data collected from a national mass merchandising retailer on 29 software enhancement projects and 23 software applications in a large IBM COBOL environment. Results indicate that the use of a code generator in development is associated with increased software complexity and software enhancement project effort. The use of packaged software is associated with decreased software complexity and software enhancement effort. These results suggest an important link between software development practices and maintenance performance.

Design: Two self-persuasion interventions were tested against 2 controls in a between-subject randomized control experiment. Setting: GuidedTrack-a web-based platform for social science experiments. Participants: Six hundred seventeen adult participants recruited via Mechanical Turk. Intervention: The experimental interventions prompted participants for self-referenced pro- and counterattitudinal arguments to elicit attitude-related thought (ART) and subsequent doubt about the attitude. The hypothesis was that the self-persuasion interventions would elicit larger and more frequent attitude certainty decreases than the controls. In the experimental groups, we also predicted a correlation between the amount of ART and attitude certainty decreases. Measures: Changes in attitude certainty were measured by participants' pre- and post-ratio scale ratings; ART was measured by the number of words participants used to respond to the interventions. Analysis: Analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi(2), and correlation. Results: A goodness-of-fit chi(2) showed that the number of participants who decreased their attitude certainty was not equally distributed between the combined experimental groups (n = 104) and the combined control groups (n = 39), chi(2)(1, n = 143) = 28.64, P < .001. Within each intervention, goodness-of-fit chi(2) with a Bonferroni correction (P = .01 or .05/4) indicated there were significantly more "decreasers" than "increasers" in intervention 1, chi(2)(1, n = 86) = 6.16, P = .01, but not intervention 2, (2)(1, n = 84) = 2.02, P = .16, the nonsense control, chi(2)(1, n = 42) = .22, P = .64), or the distraction control, chi(2)(1, n = 34) = .02, P = .89. A 1-way ANOVA revealed a significant main effect for intervention on mean certainty change (F-3,F-613 = 4.62, P = .003). Five post hoc comparisons using Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) test indicated that the mean decrease in attitude certainty resulting from intervention 1 (M = -3.29) was significantly larger than the mean decrease in attitude certainty resulting from the nonsense control (M = -0.62, t = -2.72, P = .03), the distraction control (M = 0.11, t = 3.48, P = .003), but not intervention 2 (M = -0.87, t = -2.54, P = .06). Attitude-related thought was significantly correlated with attitude certainty change in intervention 1, r(158) = -.17, t = -4.28, P = .02, but not intervention 2, r(161) = -.002, t = -.03, P = .98. Conclusion: The implication for clinical practitioners and designers of health applications is that it may be worthwhile to let patients elaborate on their personal reasons for initially forming an unhealthy attitude to increase doubt about the strongly held attitude.

Impact of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) on diagnostic thinking in endodontics of posterior teeth: A before- after study	JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY			English	Article						Cone beam computed tomography; Diagnosis; Endodontics; Radiation dosage	VOLUMETRIC TOMOGRAPHY; EFFICACY	Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of limited volume CBCT upon diagnosis as part of endodontic management of posterior teeth. The null hypothesis that CBCT does not make any difference in endodontic diagnosis was tested. Methods: A single-centre "before-after" study was conducted in a secondary healthcare establishment. Eligible patients were all adults aged 18 years or over who were referred to a specialist endodontic unit. Further inclusion criteria were that the cases were either re-treatment or de novo root canal treatment where the anatomy was judged to be complex. Exclusion criteria included vulnerable groups and de novo endodontic treatment with uncomplicated root canal anatomy. As well as a full history and clinical examination, a high quality colour photographic intraoral image, two paralleling technique periapical radiographs and limited volume CBCT examination were carried out for each patient. All components, except the CBCT dataset, were combined into a Powerpoint presentation and assessed by 4 observers. A questionnaire was designed for the observers as part of the study. Results: CBCT information only changed the radiological findings and the final diagnosis in a minority of cases. There was no clear evidence that CBCT increases the confidence of observers or that CBCT was helpful in making a diagnosis. Conclusions: Routine use of CBCT cannot not be justified on the basis of a change in diagnosis and carefully selected use is appropriate. Clinical significance: CBCT is being increasingly used in the field of endodontics. The benefits gained from the use of CBCT must be carefully balanced against the increased radiation dosage. Determination of selection criteria for the use of CBCT in endodontics is, therefore, essential. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Al-Salehi, S.

The Personal Education Program is designed to enhance medication adherence and reduce adverse self-medication behaviors in older adults with hypertension. An iterative research process was used, which involved the use of (1) pretrial focus groups to guide the design of system information architecture, (2) two different cycles of think-aloud trials to test the software interface, and (3) post-trial focus groups to gather feedback on the think-aloud studies. Results from this iterative usability-testing process were used to systematically modify and improve the three Personal Education Program prototype versions-the pilot, prototype 1, and prototype 2. Findings contrasting the two separate think-aloud trials showed that APRN users rated the Personal Education Program system usability, system information, and system-use satisfaction at a moderately high level between trials. In addition, errors using the interface were reduced by 76%, and the interface time was reduced by 18.5% between the two trials. The usability-testing processes used in this study ensured an interface design adapted to APRNs' needs and preferences to allow them to effectively use the computer-mediated health-communication technology in a clinical setting.

J	Al-Salamat, MKM				Al-Salamat, Mohammad Khair M.			Scientific and engineering practices aligned with the NGSS in the performance of secondary stage physics teachers	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEXT-GENERATION; PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; SCIENCE	The study aimed to unravel the degree to which scientific and engineering practices complied with the NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards) were present in the performance of physics teachers at the secondary stage in Taif city, Saudi Arabia. The study also sought to identify the effect of the qualification and years of experience variables on the degree to which the NGSS-aligned practices were present in the performance of physics teachers. The study adopted a mixed method in applying a closed-ended questionnaire and an interview. The questionnaire comprised 44 indicators and was applied to (49) teachers who were randomly selected. The interview was applied to (6) education supervisors who were purposively selected. The results revealed that the following five practices: "asking questions and identifying problems"; "obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information"; "planning and carrying out investigations"; "analyzing and interpreting data"; and "involvement with proofs and evidence" all rated medium. The three practices, "interpretation and solutions design"; "developing and using models"; and "using mathematics and computational thinking" all rated weak. Data analysis of education supervisors' interviews revealed that their opinions were, to an extent, concordant with the questionnaire findings. The results also revealed that graduate teachers exhibited a higher level of these practices than the teachers with just BS degrees while years of experience, as a variable, had no significant difference in teachers' use of these practices. It was concluded that teachers of physics need to reconsider their teaching practices to be aligned with NGSS. This study can be a contribution to teachers' professional development efforts that target the alignment of science instruction with the NGSS.

Combinatorial Resurfacing of Dengue Envelope Protein Domain III Antigens Selectively Ablates Epitopes Associated with Serotype-Specific or Infection-Enhancing Antibody Responses	ACS COMBINATORIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						protein resurfacing; saturation mutagenesis; yeast surface display; directed evolution; epitope-focusing; immunogen design	MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; DEPENDENT ENHANCEMENT; VIRUS; NEUTRALIZATION; DESIGN	Mutagenesis of surface-exposed residues, or "resurfacing", is a protein engineering strategy that can be utilized to disrupt antibody recognition or modulate the capacity of a protein to elicit antibody responses. We apply resurfacing to engineer Dengue virus envelope protein domain III (DENV DIII) antigens with the goal of focusing humoral recognition on epitopes of interest by selective ablation of irrelevant and undesired epitopes. Cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies have the potential to enhance Dengue virus (DENV) infection by a process called antibody-dependent enhancement, thought to be associated with severe secondary heterotypic infection. Thus, a focus on epitopes associated with broadly neutralizing antibodies is important both for understanding human antibody responses against DENV and for the development of a successful DENV vaccine. To engineer DENV DIII antigens focusing on the AG strand epitope associated with broadly neutralizing antibody responses, we generated yeast surface display libraries of DENV2 DIII where the AB loop (associated with cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibody responses) and FG loop (associated with serotype-specific antibody responses) were mutagenized to allow for all possible amino acid substitutions. Loop variants that maintained the AG strand epitope and simultaneously disrupted the AB and FG loop epitopes exhibited high and diverse mutational loads that were amenable to loop exchange and transplantation into a DENV4 DIII background. Thus, several loop variants fulfill this antigenicity criteria regardless of serotype context. The resulting resurfaced DIII antigens may be utilized as AG strand epitope-focusing probes or immunogen candidates.

In this context, qPCR-based copy number screening may serve as the method of choice for targeted screening of the relevant disease genes and their surrounding regulatory landscapes. qPCR has many advantages over alternative methods, such as its low consumable and instrumentation costs, fast turnaround and assay development time, high sensitivity and open format (independent of a single supplier). In this chapter we provide all relevant information for a successfully implement of qPCR-based copy number analysis. We emphasize the significance of thorough in silica and empirical validation of the primers, the need for a well thought-out experiment design, and the importance of quality controls along the entire work-flow. Furthermore, we suggest an appropriate and practical way to calculate copy numbers and to objectively interpret the results. The provided guidelines will most certainly improve the quality and reliability of your qPCR-based copy number screening. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Tesar, P				Tesar, Peter			HEURISTICS IN CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY	ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						cardiothoracic; care; design; education; heuristics; movement; operation; peri-operative; surgical; systems		Cardiothoracic surgical operations are complex procedures. Involved are an enormous number of steps that need to be carried out consistently, accurately (as the margin for error in cardiothoracic surgery is small) and in a time-efficient manner - thus the need for repetition in their performance to achieve excellence. Encompassed within the steps is a range of skills - motor and decision-making. The motor skills span from the gross of median sternotomy and thoracotomy, to the fine of coronary anastomoses. It is the challenge of all of this that I believe entices most prospective cardiothoracic surgeons into training, having already witnessed the difference in the ability of surgeons at surgical heuristics as beautifully described by Michael Patkin. Further, the chase for the 'perfect operation' I believe also is what keeps cardiothoracic surgeons enthralled for a career. As a comment, what will be presented is a personal perspective and should be seen as such - to quote Patton 'if everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking'. Now surgery in general is made of movement systems as already mentioned, but critically layered upon by intellect and information. This affects the decision-making process throughout an episode of care - preoperatively, intraoperatively and postoperatively. To contemplate surgical heuristics, the two then, the movement systems and the decision-making process, must be discussed individually and then brought together in the end, for it is the gel that determines patient outcomes and then becomes the science to our craft.

A qualitative study in the field of spinal cord injury in Switzerland	PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING			English	Article						Spinal cord injury; Innovation; Patient participation; Healthcare services	SHARED DECISION-MAKING; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE; IMPACT; EMPOWERMENT; HOSPITALS; ADOPTION; NEEDS	Objectives: This study explored healthcare professionals' accounts of patient participation, focusing particularly on aspects related to patients' contributions to the planning and design of healthcare services and products. It aimed to determine (1) how healthcare professionals experience patient participation, (2) what factors, in their view, may inhibit or promote it; and (3) through what channels they think it can take place. Methods: This study adopted a pragmatic epistemological approach. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals at four specialized centers for spinal cord injury in Switzerland. Results: Healthcare professionals who participated in this study were generally open to patient participation in the healthcare innovation process, highlighting several factors that may influence this process. Participants referred to three types of patient contributions that would usually emerge from informal exchange: (1) bringing in information unknown to staff; (2) reporting problems; and (3) providing concrete suggestions for improvement. Conclusion & practice implications: Healthcare professionals' positive view on and experiences with patient participation in the healthcare innovation process provide a fertile ground to further explore ways of fostering this new form of collaboration. Ultimately, it will be important to demonstrate its positive impact on both patients' as well as healthcare professionals' experiences. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Design/methodology/approachIn total, 797 students participated in the study. The data were collected through an online survey that measured students' interest in learning sustainability competencies and their pro-ecological worldviews. Participants were classified into five categories based on field of study. The data were analysed by using Pearson's correlation, independent samples t-tests, and analysis of variance. FindingsThe participating students perceived learning of critical thinking and values thinking most interesting. Interest in learning sustainability competencies and pro-ecological worldview appeared to differ across fields of study. Participants studying humanities expressed lower interest in collaborative use of digital technology compared to the participating students in science and agriculture. Participating students in health and welfare scored lower on interest in learning values thinking than students in other study fields. Research limitations/implicationsThe response rate was low. It is likely that the participants felt strongly about sustainability challenges, therefore making them more interested in sustainability competencies. The limited number of sustainability competencies studied does not allow generalisation to all sustainability competencies. Practical implicationsThe differences in interest in learning sustainability competencies and pro-ecological worldview should be understood and considered when planning sustainability education. Originality/valueThese results provide new insights into the interlinkage of students' interest in learning sustainability competencies, their pro-ecological worldviews and their field of study.

Evaluation of Internet-Based Technology for Supporting Self-Care: Problems Encountered by Patients and Caregivers When Using Self-Care Applications	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						Internet; technology; primary care; access to information; electronic patient-provider communication; self-care	EMAIL CONSULTATIONS; HEALTH INFORMATION; E-MAIL; COMMUNICATION; USABILITY; EXPERIENCES; PHYSICIAN; SERVICES; ONLINE; WEB	Background: Prior studies have shown that many patients are interested in Internet-based technology that enables them to control their own care. As a result, innovative eHealth services are evolving rapidly, including self-assessment tools and secure patient-caregiver email communication. It is interesting to explore how these technologies can be used for supporting self-care. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine user-centered criteria for successful application of Internet-based technology used in primary care for supporting self-care. Methods: We conducted scenario-based tests combined with in-depth interviews among 14 caregivers and 14 patients/consumers to describe the use of various self-care applications and the accompanying user problems. We focused on the user-friendliness of the applications, the quality of care provided by the applications, and the implementation of the applications in practice. Results: Problems with the user-friendliness of the self care applications concerned inadequate navigation structures and search options and lack of feedback features. Patients want to retrieve health information with as little effort as possible; however, the navigation and search functionalities of the applications appeared incapable of handling patients' health complaints efficiently. Among caregivers, the lack of feedback and documentation possibilities caused inconvenience. Caregivers wanted to know how patients acted on their advice, but the applications did not offer an adequate feedback feature. Quality of care problems were mainly related to insufficient tailoring of information to patients' needs and to efficiency problems. Patients expected personalized advice to control their state of health, but the applications failed to deliver this. Language (semantics) also appeared as an obstacle to providing appropriate and useful self-care advice. Caregivers doubted the reliability of the computer-generated information and the efficiency and effectiveness of secure email consultation. Legal or ethical issues with respect to possible misuse of email consultation also caused concerns. Implementation problems were mainly experienced by caregivers due to unclear policy on email consultation and the lack of training for email consultations. Conclusions: Patients' and caregivers' expectations did not correspond with their experiences of the use of the Internet-based applications for self-care. Patients thought that the applications would support them in solving their health problems. Caregivers were more reserved about the applications because of medico-legal concerns about misuse. However, the applications failed to support self-care because eHealth is more than just a technological intervention. The design of the applications should include a way of thinking about how to deliver health care with the aid of technology. The most powerful application for self-care was secure email consultation, combined with a suitable triage mechanism to empower patients' self-awareness. Future research should focus on the effectiveness of such Web-based triage mechanisms for medical complaints and on the development of interactive features to enhance patients' self-care.

Ecological resilience and resilient cities	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						adaptation; adaptive cycle; built environment; cities; ecological urban design; resilience; resilient cities; sustainability; urban systems	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS; SYSTEMS; SUSTAINABILITY; TRANSFORMATION; BIODIVERSITY; FRAMEWORK; CONSEQUENCES; FOUNDATIONS; ADAPTATION	The urban realm is changing rapidly and becoming increasingly interconnected across continents, and across contrasting types of land covers, while at the same time facing new environmental threats and experiencing new demographic and social pressures. The urban component of the global ecosystem can be made more sustainable by incorporating the ecological understanding of resilience into the discourse. Sustainability is seen as a social, normative goal, which can be promoted using the mechanisms of ecological resilience. Ecological resilience differs from engineering resilience. Ecological resilience emphasizes the capacity of a site to adjust to external shocks and changes in controlling interactions, while engineering resilience emphasizes its ability to return to a state that existed before perturbation. Ecological resilience is particularly appropriate to urban systems, given the extent and open-ended nature of the changes and challenges they face. Adaptive processes are explored as contributions to the achievement of a successful adaptive cycle in urban socio-ecological systems. Key tools for incorporating the ecological thinking about resilience into the social discourse include landscape or patch ecology, the novel idea of the metacity, an assessment of ecological and design models, and the use of designs as experiments.

However, the UHI effect has obvious three-dimensional properties. This research focuses on the vertical structure of UHI. The study combined big data from sounding balloon and surface measurements in the Database for Atmospheric and Hydrologic Research, Taiwan. Data organization and classification were conducted using the Python programming language, the NumPy mathematical function library, and the Pandas data manipulation library. Results confirmed the existence of the atmospheric boundary layer and the canopy. Furthermore, the temperature inversion of the atmospheric boundary layer fell between heights of 130 m and 667 m. The height of the inversion is affected by the wind speed and cloudiness. Thereby demonstrating that the inversion fluctuates with weather scenario changes. The research results can be applied as the direction of urban planning thinking for urban heat island countermeasures.

Healthy aging is at the top of the world political agenda as a possible means for hindering the collapse of care systems. How can ICT/sensing technology meet older people's needs for active and healthy aging? This qualitative study carried out in Italy and Romania in 2020 involved 30 participants: older adults, caregivers, and stakeholders. Based on a user-centered design approach, this study aimed to understand which requirements of ICT/sensing technologies could match people's needs of active and healthy aging. Findings highlighted that ICT/sensing technology needs to focus on six major themes: (1) learnability, (2) security, (3) independence, empowerment, and coaching values, (4) social isolation, (5) impact of habit, culture, and education variables, and (6) personalized solutions. These themes are consistent with the Active Aging framework and the factors that influence perceived usefulness and potential benefits among older adults. Consequently, this study shows how well-known, but still unresolved, issues affect the field of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to promote active and healthy aging. This suggests that the reinforcement of the public health system, especially considering the pandemic effect, requires a concrete and formidable effort from an interdisciplinary research network.

This paper discusses the methodology and its application to teach Artificial Intelligence (AI) in detail. Also, it aims to construct a web-and problem-based (PBL) system for students at the department of computer science and information engineering. The central bases on the instructional theory, learning theory, and PBL activities are applied to this paper. Given this, the authors intend to educate students with team working, data analyzing, and problem-solving capabilities. The learning experiences in the two course forms including the PBL approach and the traditional one are compared by using a questionnaire response and examination scores. Moreover, the ability of technological innovation can enable students to enhance their competencies. The research results obviously show that the PBL approach can help students learn more about Artificial Intelligence (AI). Additionally, in the PBL course with an interaction in small groups, students learn how to present what they thought, how to clarify and define what a problem is, and how to precisely grasp what the relevant information is.

Using the tourism industry as the main pressuring driver and the municipality as the territorial unit, we have compiled a vast amount of information that has been converted into an information platform for the general public, politicians, and public administrators. Working in close co-operation with the planning authorities of the Generalitat of Catalonia, we developed decision support tools as a methodological approach for coastal management. The decision support system is composed by: (a) the development of an environmental indicator-based report; (b) the use of a geographical information system (GIS); and (c) the incorporation of different types of graphical packages. These tools have been applied to the 70 municipalities of the Catalan Coast and a specific development of the system was carried out in the region of La Selva, municipalities of Blanes, Lloret de Mar. and Tossa de Mar (southern Costa Brava, Girona). The system has been designed to help coastal managers in Catalonia, and it is thought to be used in the process of developing the National Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) of the Catalan Coast following the EC Recommendation (COM/00/545).

J	Zhang, Y; Li, ZB; Gao, JM; Hong, J				Zhang, Yi; Li, Zongbin; Gao, Jianmin; Hong, Jun			New reasoning algorithm for assembly tolerance specifications and corresponding tolerance zone types	COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN			English	Article						Assembly tolerance specification; Tolerance zone type; Assembly constraint type; Datum reference frame; Polychromatic sets	SYSTEMS SCIENCE; GENERATION; MODEL	When designing a mechanical product, how to determine its assembly tolerance specifications (ATS) and tolerance zone types (TZT) is a complex design problem, in which designers need to consider comprehensively the functional requirement, geometric feature, tolerance principle, and so on. Therefore, it has high requirements for designers. Meanwhile, the design and development of a complex assembly need to be done jointly by designers. This will cause difficulties for the overall coordination of tolerance design, which affects the quality and efficiency of product development. In order to reduce the uncertainty of ATS and TZT design, and to adapt to the requirements of digital design, a new reasoning algorithm for the automatic generation of ATS and TZT is presented. Polychromatic sets theory (PST) can provide a more formal approach to describe research objects and the relationships among them. Based on PST, this method establishes reasoning relation matrices to represent the relations among research objects, such as assembly feature, assembly constraint type, datum reference frame and tolerance zone type. Therefore, it can use a unified formal mathematical model to describe the whole reasoning process from assembly to ATS and TZT. This method realizes the systematization and computerization of ATS and ILL design, which can help designers to achieve the coordination and coherence of tolerance design. This method facilitates knowledge management and improves reasoning quality and efficiency. ATSs and TZTs generated by this method meet the functional requirements of product and are in accord with the tolerance standards in ISO/ASME. Furthermore, the method only requires a little geometric information and is consistent with the designers' way of thinking, which shows good applicability for the practical design of ATS and TZT. Finally, the reasoning steps of ATSs and TZTs are demonstrated by means of an example. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This system is useful for patients with severe disabilities and provides a way for them to communicate with computers or with other people. The EEG-based BCI speller system is being studied in various ways, but it is vulnerable to adversarial examples. An adversarial example is an attack sample created by adding a little noise to an original sample in such a way that it appears normal to humans but will be misclassified by the model. Adversarial examples can be useful in situations such as military scenarios in which there is a mixture of friendly models and enemy models. When a friendly BCI speller and an enemy BCI speller coexist, an adversarial example may be mistakenly taken by the enemy BCI speller to signal an incorrect intention on the part of the person with a disability; in another scenario, an enemy BCI speller may leak personal information of the individual with a disability or initiate unwanted financial transactions. In this paper, we propose a method to create such a sample, called a ``friend-guard" EEG adversarial example. In the proposed method, a very small EEG signal is added to an original sample, creating an adversarial example that the friendly model will classify correctly but the enemy model will classify incorrectly. A P300 dataset was used in the experimental evaluation of the method, and linear regression models were used as target models. In the experiment, the proposed method was able to generate friend-guard EEG adversarial examples that were incorrectly classified with success rates of 88.4% and 69.7% by the enemy model for subject A and subject B, respectively, while maintaining the accuracy of the friendly model at 85.9% and 74.4% for subjects A and B, respectively.

In this paper, we examine the optimal structure of such policies from the perspective of mechanism design. We study a buyer-seller market in which agents have private information about both their valuations for an indivisible object and their marginal utilities for money. The planner seeks a mechanism that maximizes agents' total utilities, subject to incentive and market-clearing constraints. We uncover the constrained Pareto frontier by identifying the optimal trade-off between allocative efficiency and redistribution. We find that competitive-equilibrium allocation is not always optimal. Instead, when there is inequality across sides of the market, the optimal design uses a tax-like mechanism, introducing a wedge between the buyer and seller prices, and redistributing the resulting surplus to the poorer side of the market via lump-sum payments. When there is significant same-side inequality that can be uncovered by market behavior, it may be optimal to impose price controls even though doing so induces rationing.

J	Chong, FT; Franklin, D; Martonosi, M				Chong, Frederic T.; Franklin, Diana; Martonosi, Margaret			Programming languages and compiler design for realistic quantum hardware	NATURE			English	Review							ARCHITECTURE; COMPUTATION	Quantum computing sits at an important inflection point. For years, high-level algorithms for quantum computers have shown considerable promise, and recent advances in quantum device fabrication offer hope of utility. A gap still exists, however, between the hardware size and reliability requirements of quantum computing algorithms and the physical machines foreseen within the next ten years. To bridge this gap, quantum computers require appropriate software to translate and optimize applications (toolflows) and abstraction layers. Given the stringent resource constraints in quantum computing, information passed between layers of software and implementations will differ markedly from in classical computing. Quantum toolflows must expose more physical details between layers, so the challenge is to find abstractions that expose key details while hiding enough complexity.

These impressions are later confirmed, modified, or overturned by the results of the next trial. On the other hand, insights that stem from the intuitions of experienced clinicians, scientists and educators-while often neglected-help place current thinking into proper perspective and occasionally point the way toward formulating novel hypotheses that direct future research. Both streams of information and opinion contribute to progress. In this paper we present a wide-ranging set of unproven 'out of the mainstream' ideas of our FCCM faculty, each with a defensible rationale and holding clear implications for altering bedside management. Each proposition was designed deliberately to be provocative so as to raise awareness, stimulate new thinking and initiate lively dialog.

It appears that torsion is largely ignored because it is thought to occur rarely, and when it does, to be unimportant. In addition, difficulties in predicting torsional effects tend to discourage designers from considering torsion at all. However, the growing use of three-dimensional computer analysis programs has alerted many designers to the presence of secondary torsion actions in the structures they design, and has led them to question their significance and to seek advice on how to design for them. In addition, there are some circumstances where designers wish to transfer primary loads by torsion, either alone, or in combination with bending actions, but are prevented from doing so by difficulties in predicting torsional behaviour and a lack of information on how to design for torsion. This paper summarizes a series of investigations into the behaviour, analysis and design of members subjected to combined torsion and bending. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In the presented research, teaching experts as well as teaching novices were presented with empirically based constraints for implementation stemming from an earlier survey. In the process of various group discussions, the participants developed ideas for overcoming the constraints in the field of continuing teacher education among others. These ideas were used to create empirically based strategies for the future design of training activities in continuing education of teachers while taking these constraints into account. These strategies were later validated externally by comparing them to empirical findings on effects of training activities in continuing teacher education in general and empirical findings on GIS implementation from other studies.

Linked with a large number of disease registries, these data infrastructures became laboratories for the development of both information technology and epidemiological studies. Denmark's system of population registries had been centralized in 1924 and was further automated in the 1960s, with individual identification numbers (CPR-numbers) introduced in 1968. The ubiquitous presence of CPR-numbers in administrative routines and everyday lives created a continually growing data archive of the entire population. The resulting national-level database made possible unprecedented record linkage, a feature epidemiologists and biomedical scientists used as a resource for population health research. The specific assemblages that emerged with their practices of data mining were constitutive of registry-based epidemiology as a style of thought and of a distinct relationship between science, citizens, and the state that emerged as Scandinavian.

The questionnaire was subjected to a double validation process: an evaluation by a panel of experts, including members of the New Water Culture Foundation, and a pilot study, which allowed us to estimate the validation of the content as well as the corresponding internal consistency of the questionnaire. The construction and validation process resulted in a questionnaire consisting of 27 items with a total of 71 variables distributed in four sections: the first is related to scarcity, quantity, and distribution of water; the second collects questions about the different dimensions of water; the third analyses the different ways of carrying out water management; and the fourth and last section is related to personal actions associated with water. The reliability study showed a Cronbach alpha of 0.913, which demonstrates the development of a robust and reliable instrument allowing the identification of the most problematic issues associated with the New Water Culture.

Interactive Digital Health Tools to Engage Patients and Caregivers in Discharge Preparation: Implementation Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						patient engagement; care transitions; health information technology; implementation science	PATIENTS AFTER-DISCHARGE; ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS; CARE TRANSITIONS; SAFETY; INPATIENT; IMPACT; COMMUNICATION; OPPORTUNITIES; INTERVENTION; READMISSIONS	Background: Poor discharge preparation during hospitalization may lead to adverse events after discharge. Checklists and videos that systematically engage patients in preparing for discharge have the potential to improve safety, especially when integrated into clinician workflow via the electronic health record (EHR). Objective: This study aims to evaluate the implementation of a suite of digital health tools integrated with the EHR to engage hospitalized patients, caregivers, and their care team in preparing for discharge. Methods: We used the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to identify pertinent research questions related to implementation. We iteratively refined patient and clinician-facing intervention components using a participatory process involving end users and institutional stakeholders. The intervention was implemented at a large academic medical center from December 2017 to July 2018. Patients who agreed to participate were coached to watch a discharge video, complete a checklist assessing discharge readiness, and request postdischarge text messaging with a physician 24 to 48 hours before their expected discharge date, which was displayed via a patient portal and bedside display. Clinicians could view concerns reported by patients based on their checklist responses in real time via a safety dashboard integrated with the EHR and choose to open a secure messaging thread with the patient for up to 7 days after discharge. We used mixed methods to evaluate our implementation experience. Results: Of 752 patient admissions, 510 (67.8%) patients or caregivers participated: 416 (55.3%) watched the video and completed the checklist, and 94 (12.5%) completed the checklist alone. On average, 4.24 concerns were reported per each of the 510 checklist submissions, most commonly about medications (664/2164, 30.7%) and follow-up (656/2164, 30.3%). Of the 510 completed checklists, a member of the care team accessed the safety dashboard to view 210 (41.2%) patient-reported concerns. For 422 patient admissions where postdischarge messaging was available, 141 (33.4%) patients requested this service; of these, a physician initiated secure messaging for 3 (2.1%) discharges. Most patient survey participants perceived that the intervention promoted self-management and communication with their care team. Patient interview participants endorsed gaps in communication with their care team and thought that the video and checklist would be useful closer toward discharge. Clinicians participating in focus groups perceived the value for patients but suggested that low awareness and variable workflow regarding the intervention, lack of technical optimization, and inconsistent clinician leadership limited the use of clinician-facing components. Conclusions: A suite of EHR-integrated digital health tools to engage patients, caregivers, and clinicians in discharge preparation during hospitalization was feasible, acceptable, and valuable; however, important challenges were identified during implementation. We offer strategies to address implementation barriers and promote adoption of these tools.

J	Liu, Y; Lin, Y; Liu, J				Liu, Yong; Lin, Yi; Liu, Jian			Conflict analysis model and application based on intuitionistic fuzzy number	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Information systems; Decision making; Mathematical modelling; Fuzzy logic; Intelligent agents	SIMILARITY MEASURES; VAGUE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to establish a novel conflict analysis model so that it can well describe and deal with the real conflict problems. Design/methodology/approach - In order to overcome the shortcomings that the agents have only three attitudes with respect to the conflict issues in Pawlak conflict information system, so that it is too stiff to describe and portray the real conflict problems, the thought and methodology of the intuitionistic fuzzy set is employed to soften the agents' attitudes of the conflict issues, and then a novel conflict analysis model is constructed. This method, to begin with, the intuitionistic fuzzy number is used to express the opposition and support degree with respect to the conflict issues from agents, and then the similarity measure method is utilized to define conflict coefficient; what is more, the conflict degrees between any two agents can be obtained, and then the alliances are determined by setting different threshold values. Finally, an example illustrates the validity and rationality of the proposed method. Findings - The novel conflict analysis model proposed in the paper can well describe and resolve a real-life conflict problems such as the conflict of national territory, employee and employer. Research limitations/implications - The proposed model can only do with the conflict problems in which there do not exit the correlations among conflict issues, while it does not cope with the conflict problems with the mutually interrelated conflict issues. Originality/value - The paper succeeds in softening the Pawlak conflict analysis information system, and describing and dealing with the actual conflict problems.

In particular, we need interactive installations in order to encourage and stimulate visitors to learn and understand archaeological musical instruments through engagement and active participation: these instruments (i.e., interactive artifacts per se) are de facto unplayable and inaccessible to visitors, as a consequence of their preservation issues. However, presenting artifacts to the general public is a complex task for their multifaceted nature, and digital technology must not sacrifice accuracy or depth of information for the sake of entertainment. Moreover, deploying digital technology is a multidisciplinary effort that requires an interplay among different fields, from history and archaeology to information engineering and craftsmanship. In this article, we present a methodology to relate such disciplines in order to design a digital multimedia installation that promotes archaeological musical instruments in a museum. In defining the problem, we identify four different aspects to consider: the museum collection, the museum environment, the manufacturing opportunities for the installation, and the user experience. Such aspects are integrated in a design approach that is centered on Design Thinking. The proposed methodology is exemplified in the designing and manufacturing of an installation for a Pan flute from Egypt dated back to 700 A.D., a case in which multisensory interaction is particularly important to convey the lost sound of the instrument. We describe in detail an installation (exhibited at the Museum of Archaeological Science and Art at the University of Padova), which virtually recreates the Pan flute and communicates information related to its history, iconography, acoustics, and musicology. Just after the deployment of the installation, we also carried out an assessment with a group of experts in the fields of information engineering, music, musicology, and archaeology. The good results obtained demonstrate that the installation is a convenient way of interaction, simple to use and aesthetically integrated in the museum context.

Eye-movement displays (visualizations of a person's fixations superimposed onto the stimulus, for example, as dots or circles) might provide useful information for diagnosing that person's performance. However, making inferences about a person's task performance based on eye-movement displays requires substantial interpretation. Using graph-comprehension tasks, we investigated to what extent observers (N = 46) could make accurate inferences about a performer's multiple-choice task performance (i.e., chosen answer), confidence, and competence from displays of that person's eye movements. Observers' accuracy when judging which answer the performer chose was above chance level and was higher for displays reflecting confident performance. Observers were also able to infer performers' confidence from the eye-movement displays; moreover, their own task performance and perceived similarity with the performer affected their judgments of the other's competence.

Mow Medal. Inspired by Professor Mow's collaboration with Professor Michael Lai and the role mathematical modeling played in their work on cartilage biomechanics, this article uses our group's work on myocardial infarct healing as an example of the potential value of models in modern experimental biomechanics. Focusing more on the thought process and lessons learned from our studies on infarct mechanics than on the details of the science, this article argues that the complexity of current research questions and the wealth of information already available about almost any cell, tissue, or organ should change how we approach problems and design experiments. In particular, this paper proposes that constructing a mathematical or computational model is now in many cases a critical prerequisite to designing scientifically useful, informative experiments.

The developed AR teaching materials are thought to be useful in terms of allowing children with special education needs to meet their basic needs with their own efforts without being dependent on others. The design-based research design was used to conduct this study. Four teachers and 6 students constituted the group of the study. Design Observation Forms, Student Attention Observation Form and Criterion-Referenced Assessment Tools were used to collect data. According to the results, AR teaching material is appropriate and helpful in terms of contributing to the development of children with special education needs by bringing them real-life experiences. Moreover, it was observed that students were more eager and enthusiastic about the lesson during the course of application. Indeed, their level of readiness to the lesson increased, their interest in the subjects increased, and they were relatively more active and more likely to respond correctly to questions. In the light of results, the use of this developed AR environment in terms of the development of children with special education needs can be suggested.

Novel human D-amino acid oxidase inhibitors stabilize an active-site id-open conformation	BIOSCIENCE REPORTS			English	Article						crystallography; DAAO; DAO; drug discovery; NMDA receptor; schizophrenia	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; FREE D-SERINE; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; NMDA RECEPTORS; RAT-BRAIN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DISCOVERY; RACEMASE; MICE; INVOLVEMENT	The NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor) is a central regulator of synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. hDAA0 (human D-amino acid oxidase) indirectly reduces NMDAR activity by degrading the NMDAR co-agonist D-serine. Since NMDAR hypofunction is thought to be a foundational defect in schizophrenia, hDAA0 inhibitors have potential as treatments for schizophrenia and other nervous system disorders. Here, we sought to identify novel chemicals that inhibit hDAA0 activity. We used computational tools to design a focused, purchasable library of compounds. After screening this library for hDAA0 inhibition, we identified the structurally novel compound, 'compound 2' [3-(7-hydroxy-2-oxo-4-phenyl-2H-chromen-6-yl)propanoic acid], which displayed low nM hDAA0 inhibitory potency (K-i = 7 nM). Although the library was expected to enrich for compounds that were competitive for both D-serine and FAD, compound 2 actually was FAD uncompetitive, much like canonical hDAA0 inhibitors such as benzoic acid. Compound 2 and an analog were independently co-crystalized with hDAAO. These compounds stabilized a novel conformation of hDAA0 in which the active-site lid was in an open position. These results confirm previous hypotheses regarding active-site lid flexibility of mammalian D-amino acid oxidases and could assist in the design of the next generation of hDAA0 inhibitors.

It is no longer sufficient to conduct a reliability prediction of a new design as it is widely recognised that conventional reliability prediction methods do not impact the design. Also it is accepted that such techniques do not provide credible predictions. There is a need to develop methods and models that can be used to estimate reliability not only to demonstrate compliance with requirements but also to monitor reliability growth through the product life. A modeling framework is presented that aims to estimate the reliability of a variant design throughout the product lifecycle to support reliability enhancement decision-making. A Bayesian approach to modeling is adopted where expert judgement data is combined with inservice reliability data. Currently the proposed model is being evaluated, both theoretically and practically. This paper reports one practical implementation within an ongoing, electronic design project. A formal process of evaluation is embedded within the modeling process to capture the views of relevant engineers. managers and analysts during the implementation. Through. this e evaluation we share our experiences in the successes and challenges of modeling. and offer guidance on pitfalls to avoid. The major challenge has been managing the change in reliability Culture within the design team required to make this process work. Other problems relate to the acquisition of relevant, good quality data in a timely and cost-effective manner, The major successes relate to getting engineers to,,ether to think about reliability issues and share experiences. The modeling process is novel to the engineers. but has encouraged them to reviews the impact of their decisions on reliability and draw more useful information from the reliability indicators provided by the model.

We take as our illustrative case study a recent research project investigating public values and attitudes toward future energy system change for the United Kingdom. National-level issues such as this are often particularly difficult to engage the public with because of their inherent complexity, derived from multiple interconnected elements and policy frames, extended scales of analysis, and different manifestations of uncertainty. With reference to the energy system project, we discuss ways of meeting a series of science communication challenges arising when engaging the public with national topics, including the need to articulate systems thinking and problem scale, to provide balanced information and policy framings in ways that open up spaces for reflection and deliberation, and the need for varied methods of facilitation and data synthesis that permit access to participants' broader values.

However, as knowledge on future proofing hospital building design is yet to be consolidated, this study reviews the literature to clarify understanding of the concept in hospital building contexts. A scoping review methodology was considered appropriate to elucidate concepts in the literature. As future proofing has been developed in multiple industries, an interdisciplinary approach is taken to investigate the concept across three contexts: design (in general), the built environment and hospital buildings. Findings reveal that most studies adopted a crisis-driven approach to conceptualize future proofing - largely limited to consideration of adaptability and resilience. By synthesizing the data, the research provides a comprehensive definition of future proofing by answering the WHY, WHAT and HOW of its application to hospital building design. A future proofing model is proposed that is composed of passive-active and reactive-proactive dichotomies that identify four future proofing objectives. These objectives are addressed via six future proofing capabilities: maintainability, resilience, changeability, mitigation, improvement and transition. The study clarifies future proofing objectives in hospital building design and informs directions for further research and dialogue in policy, research, education and practice.

However, owing to the irregular and unordered natures of point clouds, it is relatively difficult for classification model to distinguish some objects with similar geometry by single-modal data only. Fortunately, additional gain information, e.g., color spectrum which can be complementary to geometric information, is able to effectively promote the classification effect. Therefore, the design of fusion strategy is a critical part in model construction. In this article, aiming to capture more abstract semantic information for color spectrum data, we elaborate a color spectrum fusion (CSF) module. It can be flexibly integrated into a classification pipeline with just negligible parameters. Then, we expand data fusion thoughts for point clouds and color spectrum and investigate three possible fusion strategies. Accordingly, we develop three architectures to constructCSF-Nets. Ultimately, by taking a weighted cross entropy loss, we can train our CSF-Nets in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on two extensively used datasets: Vaihingen 3D and LASDU show that the presented three fusion approaches all can improve the performance, while the earlier fusion strategy performs the best. Besides, compared with other well-performed methods, CSF-Net is still able to achieve satisfactory performance on overall accuracy and mF(1)-score indicator. This also validates the effectiveness of our multimodal fusion network.

J	Chen, CM; Chen, FY				Chen, Chih-Ming; Chen, Fang-Ya			Enhancing digital reading performance with a collaborative reading annotation system	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Cooperative/collaborative learning; Human-computer interface; Interactive learning environments; Teaching/learning strategies	CRITICAL THINKING; E-BOOK; TOOL; PARTICIPATION; COMPREHENSION; INFORMATION; ATTITUDES; ONLINE	As children now spend considerable time reading electronic media, digital reading skills and good reading comprehension are essential. However, many studies agree that screen-based reading leads to shallow reading, short attention spans, and poor comprehension. Therefore, this work presents a collaborative reading annotation system with a reading annotation and interactive discussion scaffold (CRAS-RAIDS) for improving reading performance in collaborative digital reading environments. This study used a quasi-experimental design. Fifty-three Grade 5 students were recruited from two classes of an elementary school in Taoyuan County, Taiwan. One class was randomly designated the experimental group used the proposed CRAS-RAIDS support for collaborative reading. The other class was designated the control group and used the traditional paper-based reading annotation method and face-to-face discussions. The two groups were then compared in terms of reading attitude, reading comprehension, and use of reading strategy in an active reading context. Analytical results show that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in direct and explicit comprehension, inferential comprehension performance, and use of reading strategy. Moreover, the experimental group, but not the control group, had a significantly improved reading attitude in the total dimensions and in the behavioral and affective sub-dimensions. Additionally, the experimental group showed positive interest and high learning satisfaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE & COMPLEXITY			English	Article						Drug inspection; game theory; healthcare; incomplete information; public policy	QUALITY MANAGEMENT; CERTIFICATION; INCENTIVES; POLICIES; DESIGN; AUDIT; COST	In recent years, there are many crimes related drug fraud occuring in China and many experts think that the main cause is that China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) adopts announced inspection (AI). In order to circumvent this difficulty, CFDA has exploited unannounced inspection (UI) since 2014. In this paper, the authors study the problem of which one performs better, AI or UI. Specifically, the authors consider a supervisor, which decides the inspection approach, inspection strength and punishment to force the firm to put self-inspection effort to meet the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice, and a firm, which produces a drug and decides its self-inspection effort. The authors use game theory to model this problem, characterize the equilibrium policies under AI, and compare the effects of the two approaches on preventing drug fraud under complete and incomplete information. The results show that under the complete information, UI performs better if the firm's technical level and the inspection cost are low and AI performs better otherwise. When the supervisor doesn't know the firm's technical level, if the low technical level is high, AI performs better. Otherwise, UI performs better if the inspection cost is low and AI performs better if the inspection cost is high.

Support for health care workers and psychological distress: thinking about now and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic	HEALTH PROMOTION AND CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION IN CANADA-RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						posttraumatic stress disorder; PTSD; depression; anxiety; support; infection; control; burnout; mental health; psychological support; health care workers	CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019; SOCIAL SUPPORT; STRESS; ALCOHOL; PROFESSIONALS; WORKFORCE	Introduction: This study explores the relationship between emotional support, perceived risk and mental health outcomes among health care workers, who faced high rates of burnout and mental distress since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional, multicentred online survey of health care workers in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic evaluated coping strategies, confidence in infection control, impact of previous work during the 2003 SARS outbreak and emotional support. Mental health outcomes were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the Impact of Event Scale - Revised and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Results: Of 3852 participants, 8.2% sought professional mental health services while 77.3% received emotional support from family, 74.0% from friends and 70.3% from colleagues. Those who felt unsupported in their work had higher odds ratios of experiencing moderate and severe symptoms of anxiety (odds ratio [OR] = 2.23; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.84-2.69), PTSD (OR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.58-2.25) and depression (OR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.57-2.25). Nearly 40% were afraid of telling family about the risks they were exposed to at work. Those who were able to share this information demonstrated lower risk of anxiety (OR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.48-0.69), PTSD (OR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.41-0.56) and depression (OR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.47-0.65). Conclusion: Informal sources of support, including family, friends and colleagues, play an important role in mitigating distress and should be encouraged and utilized more by health care workers.

However, progress is limited due to the complexity of expressway engineering and application limitations of information technology. Design and delivery are still dominated by paper files, and the management of test and inspection data is still relatively extensive. Research to date into digital expressway construction has been piecemeal and fragmented with a lack of research related to the whole construction process and a data-centric information management system yet to be realized. In response, through literature research and semi-structured interviews, the framework of a data-driven digital whole-process highway construction management platform was determined. A whole process management platform was established according to the framework, and the functional application of the proposed platform was explained through a case. The framework is proposed from the perspective of the whole process of collaborative sharing., which provides a new way of thinking to solve the problems existing in the current field of expressway construction whole-process management. It also provides data-centric management, electronic design and delivery, a refined workflow, and an efficient management process.

J	Persaud, A				Persaud, Ajax			Key competencies for big data analytics professions: a multimethod study	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & PEOPLE			English	Article						Information literacy; Multilevel research; Skill; Education; Empirical study; Competence; Work performance; Information workers; Knowledge worker performance; Soft skill	FIRM PERFORMANCE; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; BUSINESS ANALYTICS; DATA SCIENCE; ENTRY-LEVEL; JOB SKILLS; MANAGEMENT; CAPABILITY; CHALLENGES; KNOWLEDGE	Purpose This study aims to identify the precise competencies that employers are seeking for big data analytics professions and whether higher education big data programs enable students to acquire the competencies. Design/methodology/approach This study utilizes a multimethod approach involving three data sources: online job postings, executive interviews and big data programs at universities and colleges. Text mining analysis guided by a holistic competency theoretical framework was used to derive insights into the required competencies. Findings We found that employers are seeking workers with strong functional and cognitive competencies in data analytics, computing and business combined with a range of social competencies and specific personality traits. The exact combination of competencies required varies with job levels and tasks. Executives clearly indicate that workers rarely possess the competencies and they have to provide additional training. Research limitations/implications - A limitation is our inability to capture workers' perspectives to determine the extent to which they think they have the necessary competencies. Practical implications - The findings can be used by higher educational institutions to design programs to better meet market demand. Job seekers can use it to focus on the types of competencies they need to advance their careers. Policymakers can use it to focus policies and investments to alleviate skills shortages. Industry and universities can use it to strengthen their collaborations. Social implications Much closer collaborations among public institutions, educational institutions, industry, and community organizations are needed to ensure training programs evolve with the evolving need for skills driven by dynamic technological changes. Originality/value This is the first study on this topic to adopt a multimethod approach incorporating the perspectives of the key stakeholders in the supply and demand of skilled workers. It is the first to employ text mining analysis guided by a holistic competency framework to derive unique insights.

J	Steynor, A; Lee, J; Davison, A				Steynor, Anna; Lee, Jessica; Davison, Amy			Transdisciplinary co-production of climate services: a focus on process	SOCIAL DYNAMICS-A JOURNAL OF AFRICAN STUDIES			English	Article						Climate services; co-production; transdisciplinary; urban planning	SCIENCE; VULNERABILITY; FRAMEWORK; POLICY; INFORMATION; RESILIENCE	In recent years there has been a shift away from the implementation of climate services as, primarily, a science focused activity, to one which embraces the value of transdisciplinary co-production, broadening the scope of admissible knowledge in the design of climate services. Using this shift in thinking as a basis for project design, we outline a case study of transdisciplinary co-production of climate services with the City of Cape Town municipality that explores the value of the transdisciplinary process. Through the mechanism of an embedded researcher, the study set out to improve the understanding of different ways that climate terminology is used by policy and decision makers within the City. This understanding was used as a basis for co-producing climate learning tools that expose the differential understanding of climate terminology in cross-sectoral decision-making groups at the City. While the project was successful in developing co-produced learning tools, we argue that the learning, understanding and trust relationships developed as a result of the transdisciplinary co-production process could be considered more valuable than the learning tools themselves. Therefore, we stress the need for a greater focus and value to be placed on the process elements of transdisciplinary co-production going forward.

The first objective of the study was to verify whether the findings associated with a previous fMRI study could be replicated in which a novel event-related experimental design was developed which rendered it possible to investigate the brain basis of creative conceptual expansion. The ability to widen the boundaries of conceptual structures is integral to creative idea generation, which makes conceptual expansion a core component of creative cognition. Creative conceptual expansion led to the engagement of brain regions that are known to be involved in the access, storage and relational integration of conceptual knowledge in the original study. These included the anterior inferior frontal gyrus, the temporal poles and the lateral frontal pole. These findings in relation to the brain basis of creative conceptual expansion were replicated in the current study. The second objective of this study was to evaluate the brain basis of individual differences in creative conceptual expansion. The high creative group relative to the low creative group was shown to exhibit greater activity in regions of the semantic cognition network as well as the salience network during creative conceptual expansion. The findings are discussed from the point of view of classical hypotheses about information processing biases that explain individual differences in creativity including flat associative hierarchies, defocused attention and cognitive disinhibition.

J	Yazici, SC; Nakiboglu, C				Yazici, Senem Colak; Nakiboglu, Canan			Examining experienced chemistry teachers' perception and usage of virtual labs in chemistry classes: a qualitative study using the technology acceptance model 3	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Early Access						Virtual laboratory; Chemistry education; Distance education; Technology-aided education; Science education	PERCEIVED EASE; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; LABORATORIES; CLASSROOMS; INQUIRY	Guided by the Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM-3), this study concerning VL focuses to examine chemistry teachers' experiences, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, use intentions, actual use, and factors that affect them and to create a model of the real use of VL by chemistry teachers. The research was carried out in the holistic single case study design and data were collected from 26 chemistry teachers. It was found that only four chemistry teachers included the different VL applications in their lessons during and after distance education. However, although the chemistry teachers' acceptance of the inclusion of VL in distance chemistry lessons is high, it was determined that some factors prevented teachers from putting VL into real use. The first factor affecting the teachers' perceptions of the usefulness of VL is the thought that the problems encountered during the face-to-face laboratory, such as safety, inability to have every experiment done, and cost, will disappear with the use of VL. The other factor is that they think that the inclusion of VL will increase students' participation because it attracts their attention. It was determined that chemistry teachers' perceptions of ease of use regarding technology in general and VL, in particular, were primarily affected by technical difficulties such as teachers' knowledge and skills related to technology, internet connection, lack of appropriate VL applications, and problems arising from students. On the other hand, it has been concluded that the most important factors affecting the teachers who transform the use of VLs into real behavior are the contribution of VL to chemistry teaching, safety, and time-saving. From a theoretical perspective, this study focuses on the main factors affecting chemistry teachers' decisions to adopt VL for the inclusion of VL in chemistry lessons. On the practical side, this study will provide insight for chemistry teachers and university academics to develop strategies to help chemistry teachers find ways to increase their adoption of the VL in chemistry classes in ways that contribute to student learning.

J	Kopecki-Fjetland, MA; Steffenson, M				Kopecki-Fjetland, Mary A.; Steffenson, Matthew			Design and implementation of active learning strategies to enhance student understanding of foundational concepts in biochemistry	BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						active learning strategies; biochemistry; foundational concepts; learning gains; pre&#8208; requisite knowledge; teaching and learning techniques		For many students biochemistry is a demanding course because they are expected to apply previously learned foundational concepts to new biological contexts. These foundational concepts serve as a scaffold onto which to build threshold concepts such as the physical basis of interactions. Unfortunately, many students possess misconceptions or gaps in knowledge of these foundational concepts which hinder their understanding of new information. This paper describes the implementation of an iterative process to improve student foundational concept learning in an introductory biochemistry course. The process includes pre-assessment of foundational concept knowledge, introduction of interventions targeting low performing concepts and re-assessment of student learning gains. Diverse active learning strategies such as problem-based worksheets, tactile learning activities, review activities and learning cycle activities were introduced to target concepts including hydrogen bonding, pH/pKa, bond energy and chemical equilibrium. While all active learning strategies resulted in improved posttest scores compared to pretest scores, no one strategy appears to be more beneficial than another. Survey results suggest students recognized the value of utilizing the various active learning strategies in the classroom to enhance critical thinking skills, engagement during class time, and collaboration skills. The process allows instructors the breadth and flexibility to introduce diverse active learning strategies tailored to their specific student needs in an effort to improve student foundational concept learning.

There is mixed evidence about the usefulness of animations in the geosciences, and little is known about how users work with animations. This paper focuses on particular aspects: variables of the temporal dimension of a running animation, the dynamic visualization variables. Research emphasis was on methods to use these variables to encode geodata and to enable the user to manipulate the dynamic properties of the animation by interaction with these variables. Vegetation monitoring has been used as case study. A prototype animation environment, designed to explore large time series, has been qualitatively evaluated by experts in monitoring. Data collection methods used are the think aloud method, interviews and a questionnaire. The evaluation revealed user strategies, tool use and the role of effects of animation use. Results indicate that users are able to extract relevant information in a monitoring context.

Until now, five species of three genera and two additional unnamed specimens have been described. Here we report on a new material, IVPP V 23674, that can be referred to the wukongopterid Kunpengopterus sinensis due to several features such as a comparably short nasoantorbital fenestra, the dorsally rising posterodorsal margin of the ischium, and the very short first pedal phalanx of digit V relative to metatarsal IV. IVPP V 23674 provides the first view of a wukongopterid palate, which differs from all other pterosaurs by having a very large postpalatine fenestra and laterally compressed choanae, indicating that the evolution of the pterosaur palate was more complex than previously thought. Sesamoid bones at the dorsal side of manual unguals are present and are reported for the first time in a wukongopterid suggesting an arboreal life-style for these pterosaurs.

A survey was conducted with 619 teachers from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan who participated in a two-week mobile learning-based training session. The data were analysed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results show that all hypotheses were supported, indicating a positive relationship between the constructs and the acceptance and use of mobile learning technology for 21st-century skills-based training. This study's findings suggest that by emphasising factors such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, mobile self-efficacy, and student self-efficacy when designing mobile learning interventions, teachers will be more likely to accept and use mobile learning technology for 21st-century skills-based training and contributed to sustainability by providing increased access to quality education.

Speaking on Data's Behalf: What Researchers Say and How Audiences Choose	EVALUATION REVIEW			English	Article						real-world dissemination; design and evaluation of programs and policies; methodological development; content area		Background: Bayesian statistics have become popular in the social sciences, in part because they are thought to present more useful information than traditional frequentist statistics. Unfortunately, little is known about whether or how interpretations of frequentist and Bayesian results differ. Objectives: We test whether presenting Bayesian or frequentist results based on the same underlying data influences the decisions people made. Research design: Participants were randomly assigned to read Bayesian and frequentist interpretations of hypothetical evaluations of new education technologies of various degrees of uncertainty, ranging from posterior probabilities of 99.8% to 52.9%, which have equivalent frequentist p values of .001 and .65, respectively. Subjects: Across three studies, 933 U.S. adults were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who recommended adopting the new technology. We also measured respondents' certainty in their choice and (in Study 3) how easy it was to understand the results. Results: When presented with Bayesian results, participants were more likely to recommend switching to the new technology. This finding held across all degrees of uncertainty, but especially when the frequentist results reported a p value >.05. Those who recommended change based on Bayesian results were more certain about their choice. All respondents reported that the Bayesian display was easier to understand. Conclusions: Presenting the same data in either frequentist or Bayesian terms can influence the decisions that people make. This finding highlights the importance of understanding the impact of the statistical results on how audiences interpret evaluation results.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							RAIN-FOREST; DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; INTERSPECIFIC VARIATION; NEIGHBORHOOD ANALYSIS; NEOTROPICAL FOREST; GROWTH-RESPONSES; RECRUITMENT; MORTALITY; BIOMASS; HETEROGENEITY	For trees in tropical forests, competition for light is thought to be a central process that offers opportunities for niche differentiation through light gradient partitioning. In previous studies, a canopy index based on three-dimensional canopy census data has been shown to be a good predictor of species-specific demographic rates across the entire tree community on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and has allowed quantifying between-species variation in light response. However, almost all other forest census plots lack data on the canopy structure. Hence, this study aims at assessing whether position-based neighborhood competition indices can replace information from canopy census data and produce similar estimates of the interspecific variation of light responses. We used inventory data from the census plot at Barro Colorado Island and calculated neighborhood competition indices with varying relative effects of the size and distance of neighboring trees. Among these indices, we selected the one that was most strongly correlated with the canopy index. We then compared outcomes of hierarchical Bayesian models for species-specific recruitment and growth rates including either the canopy index or the selected neighborhood competition index as predictor. Mean posterior estimates of light response parameters were highly correlated between models (r>0.85) and indicated that most species regenerate and grow better in higher light. Both light estimation approaches consistently found that the interspecific variation of light response was larger for recruitment than for growth rates. However, the classification of species into different groups of light response, e. g. weaker than linear (decelerating) vs. stronger than linear (accelerating) differed between approaches. These results imply that while the classification into light response groups might be biased when using neighborhood competition indices, they may be useful for determining species rankings and between-species variation of light response and therefore enable large comparative studies between different forest census plots.

W.; Xu, Xiaoxiao; Sanjayan, Jay; Wang, Jiayuan			Review of 10 years research on building energy performance gap: Life-cycle and stakeholder perspectives	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Review						Building energy performance gap; Building life-cycle; Stakeholder; Building energy related information; Root causes	OCCUPANT BEHAVIOR; GOOGLE-SCHOLAR; POSTOCCUPANCY EVALUATION; COMFORT MANAGEMENT; THERMAL COMFORT; CONSUMPTION; INFORMATION; SIMULATION; DESIGN; SYSTEM	The reliability, security, and sustainability of energy generation and supply are of global importance and the building sector accounts for up to 32% of total energy consumption, which makes it a key player in the domain. Previous research has identified that the actual energy consumption in buildings could be as much as 2.5 times of the predicted or simulated. This large building energy performance gap (BEPG) between the predicted and actual consumption has caused a significant problem for building energy supply and demand management and therefore have attracted increasing attention from researchers around the world. These researches have resulted in a large number of publications over the last decade. However, research has not reached the phase where the root causes of BEPG could be effectively identified, managed, and eliminated. There remains a lack of systematic and comprehensive review of the current literature to understand the current state of play, and set directions for future research. To fill this gap, in this paper, a thorough survey and review of BEPG research was carried out. The paper collected and analyzed 227 relevant publications and developed a framework for better understanding previous BEPG research. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of BEPG research was conducted to explore its causes and corresponding strategies (including design concept, "hard" technologies and "soft" measures). Not only the interaction among causes but also the strengths and limitations of corresponding strategies were discussed in detail. Future research is finally recommended based on the limitations of exist strategies, including (1) building energy performance life-cycle thinking; (2) energy performance information integrity; (3) big data collection and analytical method; (4) stakeholders' attributions, decision criteria and behavior; (5) stakeholder interactions; (6) modelling and simulation validation; (7) multidisciplinary approach; and (8) building system flexibility.

While leisure plays an important role in supporting inclusion and mental health recovery, we know little about leisure initiatives designed explicitly to promote inclusion by countering stigma and exclusion. This study examined participant experiences in a leisure-based initiative known as a living library. This initiative provides opportunities for individuals living with mental illness to become living books and talk openly about their experiences of illness and recovery. Findings highlight participants' initial feelings of fear and uncertainty around sharing their stories, their perceptions of the living library as an effective method of education, and their newfound willingness to embrace identities as individuals living with mental illness who are proud of their lived experiences. These findings advance our thinking about storytelling as a powerful tool for recovery and suggest leisure initiatives supporting connection and understanding set the stage for inclusion.

However, current approaches practiced in computing education research (CER) are not sufficient to capture information beyond the basic programming process data (i.e., IDE-log data). Therefore, how cognition and affect intertwine and unfold over time in programming problem-solving activities are rarely investigated. Objectives In this study, we examined how the theory-informed measures from multimodal data that we have selected as proxies for cognitive and affective dimensions of learning, are associated with student performance, and in comparison, to prior-knowledge. Methods A high-frequency temporal data was collected with a camera, an electroencephalogram, and an eye-tracker from 40 computer science students (bachelor and master studies) in the context of a code-debugging activity. To study the cognitive processes associated with learning we focused on cognitive load theory (CLT) and the human information processing model. In addition, we complemented CLT with the model of affective dynamics in learning to avoid the machine reductionism perspective. Results Our findings demonstrated that attention, convergent thinking, and frustration were positively correlated with students' successful code-debugging (i.e., performance), and frequently manifested by high performing participants. Cognitive load, memory load, and boredom were negatively correlated with students' performance, and typically manifested by low performing participants. Implications Extending the context of analysis in reference to student cognitive processes and affective states, affords educators not just to identify lower performers, but also to understand the potential reasons behind their performance, making our method an important contribution in the confluence of CER and the learning technology communities. In addition, the insights extracted from our analyses allow us to discuss potential avenues for improving learning design and the design of interactive learning systems to support the development of students' problem-solving skills.

This negative self-reference is considered to be positively reinforced by rewarding experiences such as genuine support from others after negative self-disclosure, and negatively reinforced by avoidance of potential aversive situations. The learning account additionally predicts that negative self-reference would be maintained by an inability to adjust one's behavior when negative self-reference no longer leads to such reward. To test this prediction, we designed an adapted version of the reversal-learning task. In this task, participants were reinforced to choose and engage in either negative or positive self-reference by probabilistic economic reward and punishment. Although participants were initially trained to choose negative self-reference, the stimulus-reward contingencies were reversed to prompt a shift toward positive self-reference (Study 1) and a further shift toward negative self-reference (Study 2). Model-based computational analyses showed that depressive symptoms were associated with a low learning rate of negative self-reference, indicating a high level of reward expectancy for negative self-reference even after the contingency reversal. Furthermore, the difficulty in updating outcome predictions of negative self-reference was significantly associated with the extent to which one possesses negative self-images. These results suggest that difficulty in adjusting action-outcome estimates for negative self-reference increases the chance to be faced with negative aspects of self, which may result in depressive symptoms.

The proposed algorithm does not need to deal with the issues of predefining weight vectors and calculating indicators in the search process. It is mainly based on the thought of adaptively selecting multiple promising search directions according to crowdedness information in local objective spaces. Concretely, the proposed algorithm attempts to dynamically delete an individual of poor quality until enough individuals survive into the next generation. In this environmental selection process, the proposed algorithm considers two or three individuals in the most crowded area, which is determined by the local information in objective space, according to a probability selection mechanism, and deletes the worst of them from the current population. Thus, these surviving individuals are representative of promising search directions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified and compared with seven state-of-the-art algorithms [including four general multi/many-objective EAs and three algorithms specially designed for dealing with problems with irregular Pareto-optimal front (PF)] on a variety of complicated problems with different numbers of objectives ranging from 2 to 15. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a strong competitiveness power in terms of both the performance and the algorithm compactness, and it can well deal with different types of problems with irregular PF and problems with different numbers of objectives.

J	Cheung, A; Ball, D; Milford, M; Wyeth, G; Wiles, J				Cheung, Allen; Ball, David; Milford, Michael; Wyeth, Gordon; Wiles, Janet			Maintaining a Cognitive Map in Darkness: The Need to Fuse Boundary Knowledge with Path Integration	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL PLACE CELLS; FREELY MOVING RATS; INFORMATION-CONTENT; ANIMAL NAVIGATION; SPATIAL MAP; HONEY-BEES; DIRECTION; REPRESENTATION; POSTSUBICULUM; LANDMARKS	Spatial navigation requires the processing of complex, disparate and often ambiguous sensory data. The neurocomputa-tions underpinning this vital ability remain poorly understood. Controversy remains as to whether multimodal sensory information must be combined into a unified representation, consistent with Tolman's "cognitive map", or whether differential activation of independent navigation modules suffice to explain observed navigation behaviour. Here we demonstrate that key neural correlates of spatial navigation in darkness cannot be explained if the path integration system acted independently of boundary (landmark) information. In vivo recordings demonstrate that the rodent head direction (HD) system becomes unstable within three minutes without vision. In contrast, rodents maintain stable place fields and grid fields for over half an hour without vision. Using a simple HD error model, we show analytically that idiothetic path integration (iPI) alone cannot be used to maintain any stable place representation beyond two to three minutes. We then use a measure of place stability based on information theoretic principles to prove that featureless boundaries alone cannot be used to improve localization above chance level. Having shown that neither iPI nor boundaries alone are sufficient, we then address the question of whether their combination is sufficient and - we conjecture - necessary to maintain place stability for prolonged periods without vision. We addressed this question in simulations and robot experiments using a navigation model comprising of a particle filter and boundary map. The model replicates published experimental results on place field and grid field stability without vision, and makes testable predictions including place field splitting and grid field rescaling if the true arena geometry differs from the acquired boundary map. We discuss our findings in light of current theories of animal navigation and neuronal computation, and elaborate on their implications and significance for the design, analysis and interpretation of experiments.

This mechanistic step is "<i>productive</i>": organic chemistry students' backward-oriented reasoning	CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article							ELECTRON-PUSHING FORMALISM; EXPLANATION; THINKING; ABSTRACTION; STRATEGIES; FRAMEWORK; EDUCATION; LANGUAGE; SCIENCE	If an organic chemistry student explains that she represents a mechanistic step because "it's a productive part of the mechanism," what meaning could the professor teaching the class attribute to this statement, what is actually communicated, and what does it mean for the student? The professor might think that the explanation is based on knowledge of equilibria of alternative steps. The professor might also assume that the student implies information about how one of the alternatives influences the energetics of subsequent steps or how subsequent steps influence the equilibria of the alternatives. Meanwhile, the student might literally mean that the step is represented simply because it leads to the product. Reasoning about energetic influences has much greater explanatory power than teleological reasoning taking the consequence of mechanistic steps as the reason for their prediction. In both cases, however, the same backward-oriented reasoning is applied. Information about subsequent parts in the mechanism is used to make a decision about prior parts. To qualitatively compare the reasoning patterns and the causality employed by students and expected by their professor, we used a mechanistic approach from philosophy of science that mirrors the directionality of a mechanism and its components: activities, entities, and their properties. Our analysis led to the identification of different reasoning patterns involving backward-oriented reasoning. Participants' use of properties gave additional insight into the students' reasoning and their professor's expectations, which supports the necessity for clear expectations in mechanistic reasoning in organic chemistry classrooms. We present a framework that offers a lens to clarify these expectations and discuss implications of the framework for improving student mechanistic reasoning in organic chemistry.

J	Feng, QY; Griffiths, F; Parsons, N; Gunn, J				Feng, Qing Yi; Griffiths, Frances; Parsons, Nick; Gunn, Jane			An exploratory statistical approach to depression pattern identification	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Depression; Pattern identification; Generalized Information Entropy; Maximum entropy estimates; Quantitative analysis; Visual representation	PRIMARY-CARE; OUTCOMES	Depression is a complex phenomenon thought to be due to the interaction of biological, psychological and social factors. Currently depression assessment uses self-reported depressive symptoms but this is limited in the degree to which it can characterise the different expressions of depression emerging from the complex causal pathways that are thought to underlie depression. In this study, we aimed to represent the different patterns of depression with pattern values unique to each individual, where each value combines all the available information about an individual's depression. We considered the depressed individual as a subsystem of an open complex system, proposed Generalized Information Entropy (GIE) to represent the general characteristics of information entropy of the system, and then implemented Maximum Entropy Estimates to derive equations for depression patterns. We also introduced a numerical simulation method to process the depression related data obtained by the Diamond Cohort Study which has been underway in Australia since 2005 involving 789 people. Unlike traditional assessment, we obtained a unique value for each depressed individual which gives an overall assessment of the depression pattern. Our work provides a novel way to visualise and quantitatively measure the depression pattern of the depressed individual which could be used for pattern categorisation. This may have potential for tailoring health interventions to depressed individuals to maximize health benefit. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Investigating the effect of different configurations of a software scaffold for formulating scientific hypotheses in inquiry-oriented contexts	INSTRUCTIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Inquiry; Improving classroom science teaching; Pedagogical issues; Secondary education; Teaching; learning strategies	PROGRAMMING INSTRUCTION; COMPUTER-SIMULATIONS; DISCOVERY; STRATEGIES; SUPPORT; COMPLETION; KNOWLEDGE; EXAMPLES; PERFORMANCE; GENERATION	We extended research on scaffolds for formulating scientific hypotheses, namely the Hypothesis Scratchpad (HS), in the domain of relative density. The sample comprised of secondary school students who used three different configurations of the HS: Fully structured, containing all words needed to formulate a hypothesis in the domain of the study; partially structured, containing some words; unstructured, containing no words. We used a design with two different measures of student ability to formulate hypotheses (targeted skill): A global, domain-independent measure, and a domain-specific measure. Students used the HS in an intervention context, and then, in a novel context, addressing a transfer task. The fully and partially structured versions of the HS improved the global measure of the targeted skill, while the unstructured version, and to a lesser extent, the partially structured version, favored student performance as assessed by the domain-specific measure. The partially structured solution revealed strengths for both measures of the targeted skill (global and domain-specific), which may be attributed to its resemblance to completion problems (partially worked examples). The unstructured version of the HS seems to have promoted schema construction for students who revealed an improvement of advanced cognitive processes (thinking critically and creatively). We suggest that a comprehensive assessment of scaffolding student work when formulating hypotheses should incorporate both global and domain-specific measures and it should also involve transfer tasks.

However, so far no specific measure of a decision-maker's ability to be successful in strategic interactions has been proposed and tested. Our contribution is the development of a measure of strategic ability that borrows from both game theory and psychology. Such measure is aimed at providing an estimation of the likelihood of success in many social activities that involve strategic interaction among multiple decision-makers. To construct a reliable measure of strategic ability, that we propose to call "Strategic Quotient" (SQ), we designed a test where each item is a game and where, therefore, the individual obtained score depends on the distribution of choices of other decision-makers taking the test. The test is designed to provide information on the abilities related to two dimensions, mentalization and rationality, that we argue are crucial to strategic success, with each dimension being characterized by two main factors. Principal component analysis on preliminary data shows that indeed four factors (two for rationality, two for mentalization) account for strategic success in most of the strategically simpler games of the test. Moreover, two more strategically sophisticated games are inserted in the test and are used to investigate if and to what extent the four factors obtained by simpler games can predict strategic success in more sophisticated strategic interactions. Overall, the collected empirical evidence points to the possibility of building a SQ measure using only simple games designed to capture information about the four identified factors.

Presented as case studies, the scenarios illustrate how experts may reason through security challenges managing trust and information in the adversarial cyber world. The concepts revolve around adversarial thinking, including understanding the adversary; defining security goals; identifying targets, vulnerabilities, threats, and risks; and devising defenses. They also include dealing with confidentiality, integrity, availability (known as the CIA triad), authentication, key management, physical security, and social engineering. The authors hope that these scenarios will inspire students to explore this vital area more deeply.The target audience is anyone who is interested in learningabout cybersecurity, including those with little to no background in cybersecurity. This article will also interest those who teach cybersecurity and are seeking examples and structures for explaining its concepts. For students and educators, the authors include selected misconceptions they observed in student responses to scenarios. The contributions are novel educational case studies, not original technical research.The scenarios comprise responding to an e-mail about lost luggage containing specifications of a new product, delivering packages by drones, explaining a suspicious database input error, designing a corporate network that separates public and private segments, verifying compliance with the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and exfiltrating a USB stick from a top-secret government facility.

J	Pirkis, J; Nicholas, A; Gunnell, D				Pirkis, Jane; Nicholas, Angela; Gunnell, David			The case for case-control studies in the field of suicide prevention	EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRIC SCIENCES			English	Editorial Material						Epidemiology; research design and methods; risk factors; suicide	PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY; RISK-FACTORS; ISSUES	Much of our knowledge about the risk factors for suicide comes from case-control studies that either use a psychological autopsy approach or are nested within large register-based cohort studies. We would argue that case-control studies are appropriate in the context of a rare outcome like suicide, but there are issues with using this design. Some of these issues are common in psychological autopsy studies and relate to the selection of controls (e.g. selection bias caused by the use of controls who have died by other causes, rather than live controls) and the reliance on interviewing informants (e.g. recall bias caused by the loved ones of cases having thought about the events leading up to the suicide in considerable detail). Register-based studies can overcome some of these problems because they draw upon contain information that is routinely collected for administrative purposes and gathered in the same way for cases and controls. However, they face issues that mean that psychological autopsy studies will still sometimes be the study design of choice for investigating risk factors for suicide. Some countries, particularly low and middle income countries, don't have sophisticated population-based registers. Even where they do exist, there will be variable of interest that are not captured by them (e.g. acute stressful life events that may immediately precede a suicide death), or not captured in a comprehensive way (e.g. suicide attempts and mental illness that do not result in hospital admissions). Future studies of risk factors should be designed to progress knowledge in the field and overcome the problems with the existing studies, particularly those using a case-control design. The priority should be pinning down the risk factors that are amenable to modification or mitigation through interventions that can successfully be rolled out at scale.

Developing new educational resources related to pasture- and forage-crop systems	FOURRAGES			French	Article						Agricultural development; diagnosis; forage; forage system; grassland; teaching	LOCK-IN	Educators at agricultural academic institutions and those involved in professional degree programs need to continue to develop and broaden their pedagogic efforts: such efforts will help farmers face the variety of challenges associated with the design and implementation of the (forage) agroecosystems of the future. The range of disciplines taught should be expanded to include, notably, ecology and the environmental sciences. Additionally, educational efforts should promote the ability to adapt to and diagnose situations and encourage critical thinking and creativity, particularly using internships and hands-on experiences. In this context, the farms run by agricultural educational institutions can be extremely helpful. It is also important to teach farmers to use new diagnostic approaches (e.g., MCDA) and tools that will allow them to exploit sources of knowledge and information (e.g., e-learning, MOOCs, and-soon-big data). Such educational efforts play an essential role in permitting farmers to identify the information that will be of the greatest use to them.

These technologies present unique opportunities for supporting creativity, which is the key aim of learning in arts education. Despite the direct and close link between them and arts education, how to integrate these technologies into traditional education has long challenged government and educational experts. Teachers' digital literacy has been regarded as an important part of information communication technologies-enabled education. Because an arts education uses more equipment than other types of education, it is more dependent on digital media. Thus, arts teachers' digital literacy has directly affected their teaching, and has played an increasingly important role in education. This paper, having investigated eight Chinese arts teachers' digital concepts and utilities in their teaching, explores digital literacy in arts teaching in China from different perspectives. It also offers recommendations for research into arts teachers' digital literacy and arts education research in China for the future. Overall, this study designs a framework of factors for Chinese arts teachers' digital literacy.

It plays a central role in the recent technological advances in biomedical technology, especially in the areas of disease diagnosis, drug design and drug delivery. In this review, we present the recent trend and challenges in the development of nanomaterials for biomedical applications with a special emphasis on the analysis of neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are the chemical messengers which transform information and signals all over the body. They play prime role in functioning of the central nervous system (CNS) and governs most of the metabolic functions including movement, pleasure, pain, mood, emotion, thinking, digestion, sleep, addiction, fear, anxiety and depression. Thus, development of high-performance and user-friendly analytical methods for ultra-sensitive detection of neurotransmitters remain a major challenge in modern biomedical analysis. Nanostructured materials are emerging as a powerful mean for diagnosis of CNS disorders because of their unique optical, size and surface characteristics. This review provides a brief outline on the basic concepts and recent advancements of nanotechnology for biomedical applications, especially in the analysis of neurotransmitters. A brief introduction to the nanomaterials, bionanotechnology and neurotransmitters is also included along with discussions on most of the patents published in these areas.

Recognizing the difference between data visualisaion (DV) (i.e. static visual outputs) and visual analytics (VA) (i.e. a process of interactive visual data exploration, guided by user's domain and contextual knowledge), this paper focuses on VA for non-technical domain experts. By seeking to understand knowledge sharing from VA experts to nontechnical users of VA in a multidisciplinary team, we aim to explore how these domain experts learn to use VA as a thinking tool, guided by their knowing-in-practice. The research described in this paper was conducted in the context of a long-term industry-wide research project called the 'Visual Historical Atlas of the Australian Co-operatives', led by a multidisciplinary VA team who faced the challenge tackled by this research. Using Action Design Research (ADR) and the combined theoretical lens of boundary objects and secondary design, the paper theorises a three-phase method for knowledge transfer, translation and transformation from VA experts to domain experts using different types of VA-related boundary objects. Together with the proposed set of design principles, the three-phase model advances the well-established stream of research on organizational use of analytics, extending it to the emerging area of visual analytics for non-technical decision makers.

J	Perrin, D; Barton, J				Perrin, D; Barton, J			Issues associated with transforming household attitudes and opinions into materials recovery: a review of two kerbside recycling schemes	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						recycling; households; behaviour; information; waste; monitoring	PARTICIPATION; BEHAVIOR	New mandatory household recycling targets present a serious challenge to Local Authorities within the UK. Nine out of ten households claim to recycle, yet the National recycling rate remains at 9%. Fully understanding how to convert household attitudes and opinions into efficient participatory behaviour, within what still remains a voluntary activity, is essential if targets are to be met at an 'affordable' economic and environmental cost. Household attitudes and opinions towards recycling are reviewed and problems converting these positive responses into high material recycling levels are discussed. Households recycle primarily for environmental reasons and adequate scheme provision whilst 'inconvenience/no time' was cited as the largest barrier to recycling. Providing informative feedback to households increased overall scheme diversion levels up to a maximum of 48%, participation up to 93% and weekly set out levels up to 84%. Recoveries of all fractions increased, particularly the packaging fraction following feedback. Although both kerbside schemes increased the proportion of households claiming to recycle, they differed in relation to the level of participation, recovery of comparable materials, participant's efficiency of participation, household satisfaction and desire to change the scheme and the type of recycler attracted to the scheme. Household recycling efficiency is thought to be related to: (1) the level of inconvenience posed to the householder in relation to the type and design of the scheme offered; (2) the material being recycled; and (3) the level of change required in existing behaviours in order to participate within a particular recycling scheme.

A critical revision of available data from three highly contaminated Italian sites (Augusta Bay, Sicily; Cagliari Gulf, Sardinia; Pozzuoli Bay, Campania) revealed the crucial role of biogeochemical/physical dynamics and potential widespread delivery of contaminants as key components for a wider comprehensive sediment management. Materials and methods Datasets of organic pollutants (sigma PAHs, sigma PCBs), heavy metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn), radionuclides, and grain size composition of marine sediments of all three sites were critically reviewed and seafloor bathymetric data were analyzed. Results and discussion A critical review of available physical and chemical information of sediments collected from the three marine sites provides a better understanding of the physical and biogeochemical dynamics of large-scale dispersion of contaminants in those areas, as well as new insights in terms of improved sediments management policies with actions of larger scale monitoring of the "buffer zone"confining with the national relevance and highly contaminated site to trace inputs and accumulation effects of pollutants deriving from the point-source. Conclusions This study demonstrates how the presence of polluted sediments on the coastal areas can have, also after the closure of anthropogenic activities, a potential impact at a large scale. Then to better evaluate the effective impact, we suggest the adoption of a buffer zone contiguous to the national relevance sites (SIN) area. While SINs are optimized to define the state of the art of the near-source pollution, buffer zones may help to outline the rate of delivery of pollutants to the deep sea. Buffer zones must be designed by taking into account the local hydrodynamics, sedimentology, and geomorphology, and should be monitored, even if at a lower resolution, like SINs.

Research has identified that fragmentation and inefficiency still existed in the water industry project delivery processes. These issues can be addressed by harnessing the collaboration that BIM brings by using emerging information technology. The UK water industry has had little research in the use of BIM in the project delivery processes over the years. Design/methodology/approach The aim of the research is to explore and examine BIM elements currently used in the water industry, as well as understand the organisational cultural support for BIM. It also investigated the adoption of BIM which will enable to improve water industry project delivery processes. An empirical study was performed in the UK given the relatively new and unexplored nature of the research problem, a qualitative research methodology was adopted. In total, 14 semi-structured interviews from six water sector organisations were conducted to collect data, which was then analysed using thematic analysis for inference and conclusion. Findings The study identified that BIM has already changed how projects are delivered by the water companies and their supply chain. Use of emerging technology such as Autodesk Revit, Civil 3D and virtual reality has gained traction and is leading organisations to continue investing in these areas to remain relevant. Although staff training was offered by all organisations within the study cohort, some interviews still thought that more can be done by their organisations as BIM is still maturing. Those interviewed regarded BIM models as data and information rich with the ability to enable the supply chain to obtain quicker approvals. Originality/value The paper provides a richer insight into the understanding and awareness of BIM elements used in the water industry to improve project delivery processes. This study suggests that the water industry supply chain has taken positive steps and started to benefit from BIM use. It also recommends that there is a need for cross-sector collaboration to capture and share best and worst practices relating to BIM adoption in the water sector.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is an illustrative case study approach, highlighting three real-world exemplars of causal modelling for wicked problem definition. Findings - The findings show how the traditional linear research methods of social marketing are not sensitive enough to the dynamics and complexities of wicked problems. A shift to non-linear causal modelling techniques and methods, using interaction as the unit of analysis, provides insight and understanding into the chains of causal dependencies underlying social marketing problems. Research limitations/implications - This research extends the application of systems thinking in social marketing through the illustration of three non-linear causalmodelling techniques, namely, collective intelligence, fuzzy cognitive mapping and system dynamics modelling. Each technique has the capacity to visualise structural and behavioural properties of complex systems and identify the central interactions driving behaviour. Practical implications - Non-linear causal modelling methods provide a robust platform for practical manifestations of collaborative-based strategic projects in social marketing, when used with participatory research, suitable for micro, meso, macro or systems wide interventions. Originality/value - The paper identifies non-linear causality as central to wicked problem scoping identification, documentation and analysis in social marketing. This paper advances multi-causal knowledge in the social marketing paradigm by using fuzzy, collective and interpretative methods as a bridge between linear and non-linear causality in wicked problem research.

J	Ledger, L; Worsley, P; Hope, J; Schoonhoven, L				Ledger, Lisa; Worsley, Peter; Hope, Jo; Schoonhoven, Lisette			Patient involvement in pressure ulcer prevention and adherence to prevention strategies: An integrative review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES			English	Review						Adherence; Decision-making; Non-adherence; Patient involvement; Pressure ulcer; Community	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; NHS HOSPITALS; INJURY; COST; CARE; PARTICIPATION; PREVALENCE; ADULTS; IMPACT; RISK	Background: Chronic wounds including pressure ulcers represent a significant burden to patients and healthcare providers. Increasingly patients are required to self-manage their care but patient adherence to prevention strategies is a significant clinical challenge. It is important to increase understanding of the factors affecting patients' ability and willingness to follow pressure ulcer prevention interventions. Objectives: To investigate from a patient perspective the factors affecting adherence to pressure ulcer prevention strategies. Design: Integrative literature review. Data sources: A systematic search of electronic databases (Athens, Pub Med, Web of Science, Science Direct, AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsychInfo, Google Scholar, Delphis) was initially conducted in May 2017 (repeated August 2018). Review methods: The methodological quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) principles. The Noticing, Collecting, Thinking (NCT) model of qualitative data analysis was used to identify key themes. Results: A total of twelve studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The majority of studies were qualitative and three key themes were identified: (i) individual/daily lifestyle considerations, (ii) patient involvement in the decision-making process, and (iii) pain and/or discomfort. Conclusion: There is limited research that focuses on the patient view of factors affecting adherence to prevention measures, particularly in community settings. Individual and daily lifestyle considerations and involvement in decision-making around pressure ulcer care are important aspects from the patient perspective. Further research is necessary to explore which factors affect patient adherence in order to improve clinical practice and support patient involvement in preventative strategies.

J	van der Linden, D; Hadar, I				van der Linden, Dirk; Hadar, Irit			A Systematic Literature Review of Applications of the Physics of Notations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Review						Systematic literature review; physics of notations; visual notations; cognitive effectiveness; design rationale	VISUAL LANGUAGE; COGNITIVE EFFECTIVENESS; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; KNOWLEDGE; DIAGRAM	INTRODUCTION: The Physics of Notations (PoN) is a theory for the design of cognitively effective visual notations, emphasizing the need for design grounded in objective and verifiable rationale. Although increasingly applied, no systematic analysis of PoN applications has yet been performed to assess the theory's efficacy in practice. OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to assess the scope and verifiability of PoN applications. METHOD: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) of peer-reviewed PoN applications. We analyzed what visual notations have been evaluated and designed using the PoN, for what reasons, to what degree applications consider requirements of their notation's users, and how verifiable these applications are. RESULTS: Seventy PoN applications were analyzed. We found major differences between applications evaluating existing notations and applications designing new notations. Particularly, in the case of new notations, we found that most applications adopted the PoN with little critical thought towards it, rarely considered its suitability for a particular context, and typically treated and discussed the PoN with few, if any, verifiable details and data. CONCLUSION: The results warrant consideration for those applying the PoN to do so carefully, and show the need for additional means to guide designers in systematically applying the PoN.

In this study, silk protein 11R26 from the dragline silk protein of Nephila clavipes was used to analyze the potential effects of the special amino acids on the function of 11R26. Three protein derivatives, ZF4, ZF5, and ZF6, were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis, based on the sequence of 11R26, and among these derivatives, serine was replaced with cysteine, isoleucine, and arginine, respectively. After these were expressed and purified, the mechanical performance of the fibers derived from the four proteins was tested. Both hardness and average elastic modulus of ZF4 fiber increased 2.2 times compared with those of 11R26. The number of disulfide bonds in ZF4 protein was 4.67 times that of 11R26, which implied that disulfide bonds outside the poly-Ala region affect the mechanical properties of spider silk more efficiently. The results indicated that the mechanical performances of spider silk proteins with small molecular size can be enhanced by modification of the amino acids residues. Our research not only has shown the feasibility of large-scale production of spider silk proteins but also provides valuable information for protein rational design.

The goal of this study is to develop a knowledge-based production scheduling software with experts technical knowledge. This paper focuses on printing process from the whole of production processes, and describes the result of business process analysis to obtain expert's implicit knowledge. In printing process, finished products are printed by various colors and character plates (operations). When the type of operation is switched, the printing process requires "setup operation" with production idle time. The production lead time cart be shortened by collecting the products with same type of operation, so the objective of this problem can be designed by the minimization of setup operations. This paper formulates a scheduling problem by using the result of analysis, and expresses a solution methods based all expert's empirical selection rule. The reason we have concentrated on the expert's technique is that the knowledge based solution method might be easily able to modify the procedures by workers themselves. Usually meta-heuristics including genetic algorithms can obtain more effective solution than the expert's, but most Of on-site workers cannot fully understand the solution methods because they am too mathematical to use. Until now, the whole of business processes in the parts supplier have been examined by our previous works, and we have mainly discussed operations in the printing process only by theoretical aspect. However the previous approaches cannot flexibly respond to the changes of production condition such as dispersion of order, interrupt of urgent task, and change of inventory quantity in spite of the actual field can respond these unpredictable and uncertain situations. Many problems in meta-heuristics can be thought to be due to the parameter tuning that experts in actual production field cannot do. Therefore this paper regards that the expert's empirical know-how, tacit knowledge, is the most important factor in response to the changes of production condition, and the present state is modeled by using actual production information, particularly interview in the printing process.

This approach allows researchers to assess whether and how model relationships vary as a function of an underlying factorial design, both in terms of the design factors in isolation (i.e. main effects) as well as their joint impact (i.e. interaction effects). Design/methodology/approach - After an introduction of its building blocks as well as a comparison with related methods (i.e. n-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multi-group analysis (MGA)), a step-by-step guideline of the PLS FAC-SEM approach is presented. Each of the steps involved in the PLS FAC-SEM approach is illustrated using data from a customer value study. Findings - On a methodological level, the key result of this research is the presentation of a generally applicable step-by-step guideline of the PLS FAC-SEM approach. On a context-specific level, the findings demonstrate how the predictive ability of several key customer value measurement methods depends on the type of offering (feel-think), the level of customer involvement (low-high), and their interaction (feel-think offerings x low-high involvement). Originality/value - This is a first attempt to apply the factorial structural equation models (FAC- SEM) approach in a PLS-SEM context. Consistent with the general differences between PLS-SEM and covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM), the FAC-SEM approach, which was originally developed for CB-SEM, therefore becomes available for a larger amount of and different types of research situations.

J	Voinov, A; Costanza, R				Voinov, A; Costanza, R			Watershed management and the Web	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						environmental science; decision support systems; dynamic spatial modeling; Internet	ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT	Watershed analysis and watershed management are developing as fools of integrated ecological and economic study They also assist decision-making at the regional scale. The new technology and thinking offered by the advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web is highly complementary to some of the goals of watershed analysis. Services delivered by the Web are open, interactive, fast, spatially distributed, hierarchical and flexible. The Web offers the ability to display information creatively, to interact with that information and to change and modify it remotely. In this way the Internet provides a much-needed opportunity to deliver scientific findings and information to stakeholders and to link stakeholders together providing for collective decision-making. The benefits fail into two major categories: methodological and educational. Methodologically the approach furthers the watershed management concept, offering an avenue for practical implementation of watershed management principles. For educational purposes the Web is a source of data and insight serving a variety of needs at all levels. We use the Patuxent River case study to illustrate the web-based approach to watershed management A watershed scale simulation model is built for the Patuxent area and if serves as a core for watershed management design based on web applications. It integrates the knowledge available for the Patuxent area in a comprehensive and systematic format, and provides a conceptual basis for understanding the performance of the watershed as a system. Moreover the extensive data collection and conceptualisation required within the framework of the modeling effort stimulates close contact with the environmental management community. This is further enhanced by offering access to the modeling results and the data sets over the Web. Additional web applications and links are provided to increase awareness and involvement of stakeholders in the watershed management process. We argue that it is not the amount and quality of information that is crucial for the success of watershed management, but how well the information is disseminated, shared and used by the stakeholders. In this respect the Web offers a wealth of opportunities for the decision-making process, but still to be answered are the questions at what scale and how widely will the Web be accepted as a management tool, and how can watershed management benefit from web applications.

Computational techniques can narrow the search space for experimental follow up, but even they become unaffordable when evaluating large numbers of molecules. Therefore, machine learning (ML) strategies are being developed as computationally cheaper complementary techniques for navigating and triaging large chemical libraries. Here, we explore how an active learning protocol can be combined with first-principles based alchemical free energy calculations to identify high affinity phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2) inhibitors. We first calibrate the procedure using a set of experimentally characterized PDE2 binders. The optimized protocol is then used prospectively on a large chemical library to navigate toward potent inhibitors. In the active learning cycle, at every iteration a small fraction of compounds is probed by alchemical calculations and the obtained affinities are used to train ML models. With successive rounds, high affinity binders are identified by explicitly evaluating only a small subset of compounds in a large chemical library, thus providing an efficient protocol that robustly identifies a large fraction of true positives.

"And I Think That We Can Fix It" <i>Mental Models Used in High</i>-<i>risk Surgical Decision Making</i>	ANNALS OF SURGERY			English	Article						communication; informed consent; mental models; surgical decision making	INFORMED-CONSENT; SURGERY; CARE	Objective: To examine how surgeons use the "fix-it" model to communicate with patients before high-risk operations. Background: The "fix-it" model characterizes disease as an isolated abnormality that can be restored to normal form and function through medical intervention. This mental model is familiar to patients and physicians, but it is ineffective for chronic conditions and treatments that cannot achieve normalcy. Overuse may lead to permissive decisionmaking favoring intervention. Efforts to improve surgical decision making will need to consider how mental models function in clinical practice, including "fix-it." Methods: We observed surgeons who routinely perform high-risk surgery during preoperative discussions with patients. We used qualitative content analysis to explore the use of "fix-it" in 48 audio-recorded conversations. Results: Surgeons used the "fix-it" model for 2 separate purposes during preoperative conversations: (1) as an explanatory tool to facilitate patient understanding of disease and surgery, and (2) as a deliberation framework to assist in decision making. Although surgeons commonly used "fix-it" as an explanatory model, surgeons explicitly discussed limitations of the "fix-it" model as an independent rationale for operating as they deliberated about the value of surgery. Conclusions: Although the use of "fix-it" is familiar for explaining medical information to patients, surgeons recognize that the model can be problematic for determining the value of an operation. Whether patients can transition between understanding how their disease is fixed with surgery to a subsequent deliberation about whether they should have surgery is unclear and may have broader implications for surgical decision making.

The findings will be used to further explore the role of a narrative in motivating continued active videogame play. Materials and Methods: Twenty children (8-11 years old of mixed gender) watched two cartoons (narrative and non-narrative) and were subsequently interviewed. A thematic matrix was used to analyze the interviews. Results: The narrative cartoon (n = 11) was only slightly preferred compared with the non-narrative one (n = 9), with little difference among the participants. The theme categories identified during the analyses were plot, characters, and suggestions. The fight scenes were mentioned by the children as a likeable aspect of the narrative cartoon. In the non-narrative cartoon, the vast majority (n = 17) liked the information about physical activity that was provided. The children enjoyed the appearance and personalities of the characters in both cartoons. A discrepancy in the data about the fight scenes (narrative cartoon) and characters (both cartoons) was found among the female participants (i.e., some girls did not like the fight and thought the characters were too aggressive). However, most of the children wanted to see more action in the story, an increase in the number of fight scenes (narrative cartoon), or more information about exercise and examples of exercises they could do (non-narrative cartoon). They also suggested adding a game to the non-narrative cartoon, including more characters, and improving the animation in both cartoons. Conclusions: The children preferred the narrative cartoon because of the story and the fight. Some gender differences were found, which further studies should investigate.

An algorithm to improve the performance of medical signal filter with implementation using arm processor	BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA			English	Article						Digital-filter design; Signal processing; ARM processor; Power reduction; Delay reduction; FIR filter		Medical signals ruined with noise like electromagnetic interference and other sources must either to be filtered or eliminated, filtering is an important issue for design thought of real time health care and other process. This work presents a better Digital filter which can be implemented easily and has around 50% less power and area improvement. Usually, digital-filters were realized with dedicated Digital Signal Processors or FPGAs. Complexity, power consumption is more in this implementation as these methods need more computations especially multiplication. For better performance the multiplications is to be minimized, but ARM based processors like Cortex M4 consists command sets and hardware structure that can effectively run this nature of the calculations. The Aim of this paper is handling the signal processing activities on an ARM Cortex M4 in its place of employing another difficult Digital Signal Processor has the understandable benefit that an additional processor is not essential. This leads to low cost, minimum board space, less power expenditure, minimum outer bus passage and lower interfacing expenses. Everything can be united into a single build process and binary and no need to do repair on many processors from various vendors. Keeping everything on one processor simplifies the structure, cost of construction and selection of ARM as the processor is a clear one. As we have complete help from all the assets on the back of ARM, including forums, libraries, development tools, and we may employ a hardware structure that has turned into a customary in the Embedded Systems society which results in optimized performance in the realized Digital filter.

In particular, the outbreak of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus this year has caused serious losses to the global economy. On this basis, this article attempts to use modern advanced artificial intelligence technology and modern social science and technology to provide technical assistance and support for the prevention and control of major public health incidents, in order to improve the Chinese government's public relations capabilities and response to public health emergencies. Ability and level. This article attempts to use 3S technology closely related to artificial intelligence technology to design and establish a public health emergency response system, so as to improve the government's response and decision making ability to respond to and deal with public health emergencies, and reduce the occurrence of emergencies. The results showed that among the 298 respondents, 145 believed that public health emergencies depend on human-to-human transmission. Most event information is acceptable, while 169 people who rely on mobile phones for information think that most of them are acceptable, and 89 people who rely on TV media for information think that most of them are acceptable. It shows that the use of artificial intelligence technology can effectively solve and prevent the further development of the situation, and at the same time improve the government's ability and level to respond to major public health emergencies, and increase the government's prestige in the eyes of the public.

The scale of their impact is also far-reaching. Technologies such as artificial intelligence, data analytics, robotics, digital platforms, social media, blockchain, and 3-D printing affect many parts of the organization simultaneously, enabling new interdependencies within and between units and with actors that many organizations have typically considered to be outside their boundaries. Consequently, today's emerging technologies have the potential to fundamentally shape all aspects of organizing. This article introduces the special issue "Emerging Technologies and Organizing." We treat these new technologies as "emerging" because their uses and effects are still varied and have yet to stabilize around a recognizable set of patterns and because the technologies themselves are, by design, always changing and adapting. To theorize the relationship between emerging technologies and organizing, we draw on relational thinking in philosophy and sociology to develop a relational perspective on emerging technologies. Our goal in doing so is to create a new way for organizational scholars to incorporate the ever-increasing role of technology in their theorizing of key organizational processes and phenomena. By developing a relational perspective that treats emerging technologies not as stable entities, but as a set of evolving relations, we provide a novel way for organizational scholars to account for the role of technology in their topics of interest. We sketch the outlines of this relational perspective on emerging technologies and discuss the implications it has for what organizational scholars study and how we study it.

However, delays in intensification are common, and may be partially due to unrealistic patient expectations. To explore whether patient expectations regarding their diabetes and hypertension are congruent with the natural history of these conditions. Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews. Sixty adults from an urban academic primary care clinic taking oral medications for both diabetes (duration < 10 years) and hypertension (any duration) (1) Expectations for their a) current diabetes and hypertension medications, b) need for additional medications, c) likelihood of cure (not requiring medications); (2) preferences for receiving information on expected duration of treatments The average patient age was 60 years, and 65 % were women. Nearly half (48 %) of participants expected to discontinue current diabetes medications in 6 years or less, whereas only one-fifth (22 %) expected to take medications for life. For blood pressure medications, one-third (37 %) expected to stop medicines in 6 years or less, and one-third expected to take medicines for life. The vast majority did not expect that they would need additional medications in the future (oral diabetes medications: 85 %; insulin: 87 %; hypertension medications: 93 %). A majority expected that their diabetes (65 %) and hypertension (58 %) would be cured. Most participants believed that intensifying lifestyle changes would allow them to discontinue medications, avoid additional medications, or cure their diabetes and hypertension. Nearly all participants (97 %) wanted to hear information on the expected duration of their diabetes and hypertension treatments from their healthcare provider. Providers should educate patients on the natural history of diabetes and hypertension in order to manage patient expectations for current and future medications. Future research should assess whether education can increase the adoption of and adherence to medications, without diminishing enthusiasm for lifestyle changes.

J	Roos, AK; Burgos, E; Ericsson, DJ; Salmon, L; Mowbray, SL				Roos, AK; Burgos, E; Ericsson, DJ; Salmon, L; Mowbray, SL			Competitive inhibitors of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> ribose-5-phosphate isomerase B reveal new information about the reaction mechanism	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PENTOSE-PHOSPHATE PATHWAY; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; PHOSPHOGLUCOSE ISOMERASE; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; SPINACH; SUGARS	Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (Rpi), an important enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, catalyzes the interconversion of ribulose 5-phosphate and ribose 5-phosphate. Two unrelated isomerases have been identified, RpiA and RpiB, with different structures and active site residues. The reaction catalyzed by both enzymes is thought to proceed via a high energy enediolate intermediate, by analogy to other carbohydrate isomerases. Here we present studies of RpiB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis together with small molecules designed to resemble the enediolate intermediate. The relative affinities of these inhibitors for RpiB have a different pattern than that observed previously for the RpiA from spinach. X-ray structures of RpiB in complex with the inhibitors 4-phospho-D-erythronohydroxamic acid (K-m 57 mum) and 4-phospho-D-erythronate (K-i 1.7 mm) refined to resolutions of 2.1 and 2.2 Angstrom, respectively, allowed us to assign roles for most active site residues. These results, combined with docking of the substrates in the position of the most effective inhibitor, now allow us to outline the reaction mechanism for RpiBs. Both enzymes have residues that can catalyze opening of the furanose ring of the ribose 5-phosphate and so can improve the efficiency of the reaction. Both enzymes also have an acidic residue that acts as a base in the isomerization step. A lysine residue in RpiAs provides for more efficient stabilization of the intermediate than the corresponding uncharged groups of RpiBs; this same feature lies behind the more efficient binding of RpiA to 4-phospho-D-erythronate.

We may invoke an analogy simply to express an idea, but analogy use may also constitute a key part of a theoretical explanation and an argument. In this latter-explanatory-use, we not only think but also reason by analogy. But if analogy use constitutes reasoning, it must also be critically evaluated as such. In this article we first combine ideas from the literature on argumentation and cognitive science to examine how analogies are used in organization theory. We then construct a framework to guide the evaluation of reasoning by analogy. Finally, we show that by understanding how analogies are used and evaluated, we can also gain an understanding of how theories progress.

Design and Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted 142 patients with schizophrenia. The data were collected using the Personal Information Form, Negative Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (NATQ) and Social Functioning Assessment Scale (SFAS). Findings There was a strong negative correlation between the mean scores obtained from the overall NATQ and SFAS. In addition, negative automatic thoughts of the patients with schizophrenia had a negative effect of 47.2% on their social functionality. Practice Implications It was found that the patients had moderate levels negative automatic thoughts and social functionality; and that their negative automatic thoughts affected their social functionality negatively.

J	Wood, B; Kallestrup, P				Wood, Benjamin; Kallestrup, Per			Benefits and Challenges of Using a Participatory Approach with Community-based Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Interventions in Displaced Populations	TRANSCULTURAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						community-based; displaced populations; mental health; participatory approach; psychosocial		The mental health burden of displaced communities is enormous and ever-increasing. Community-based Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (CB-MHPSS) interventions are seen as vital in addressing this challenge, and they have been lauded as being integral in the overall multi-level Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Intervention approach in humanitarian settings. This article assumes that CB-MHPSS innately require a participatory approach to truly benefit the targeted population. It explores important benefits and challenges of using a participatory approach with CB-MHPSS interventions, as well as identifying key considerations in their design and implementation. A literature review of the PubMed database, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, and defined 'grey literature' identified 42 relevant articles. Thematic analysis identified dilemmas raised by many of the authors, including: the disconnect between using a participatory community-based approach and evidence-based medicine; using locally derived versus standardised measures; incorporating local mental health expressions and idioms into the intervention versus using standardised diagnostic classifications; empowering communities versus falling into the hands of local power dynamics and agendas; and trying to allow for sufficient time to develop relationships and build trust with the targeted community. The findings can serve to encourage reflexivity and critical thinking in the design and implementation of future CB-MHPSS interventions, which will be required to develop robust evidence that supports CB-MHPSS interventions in displaced communities.

To monitor the spread of the epidemic, studies discussing the design of related healthcare information systems have been increasing recently. However, these studies might not consider the aspect of user-centric design when developing healthcare information systems. This study examined these innovative technology applications and rapidly built prototype systems for smart healthcare through a systematic literature review and a study of patient innovation. The design guidelines for the Smart Healthcare System (SHS) were then compiled through an expert review process. This will provide a reference for future research and similar healthcare information system development.

J	Tisza, G; Markopoulos, P; King, H				Tisza, Gabriella; Markopoulos, Panos; King, Heather			Socioeconomic background influences children's attitudes and learning in creative programming workshop	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						SES; Programming; Attitudes; Learning outcomes; Fun	SCHOOL; ACHIEVEMENT	Programming and creative thinking are important skills for the twenty-first century. A large body of evidence suggests that a playful approach to learning helps children engage deeply with programming, improves their creative thinking skills, and shapes a positive attitude towards programming. However, such research has rarely considered how differences in socioeconomic background impact the way children experience such programming activities. The theoretical perspective of science capital suggests that children from high income families will hold more positive attitudes towards science and technology and will perform better in programming than children from lower income families based on their generally higher exposure to experiences involving computing technology. To examine this assumption, we designed and implemented single-occasion programming workshops lasting two hours that followed the Lifelong Kindergarten Approach and investigated differences in children's attitudes, their learning outcomes (measured by a pre-post-test, perceived learning, and task-based performance), and the fun they experienced during the workshops. We collected data from three primary schools in three distinct socioeconomic neighborhoods (i.e., high-, middle-, and low-income areas), involving, in total, 138 children. Findings indicate that the workshops had a positive effect on the children's attitude towards programming in the middle- and low-income schools only. The self-reported learning was similar in the three schools, but children from the low-income school significantly outperformed children from the high-income school in their task-based performance. Children from the middle-income school had the most fun, however, the experience of fun only significantly affected the low-income school children's perceived learning scores. We conclude that children from the middle- and low-income schools profited the most from the playful programming workshop and call on future research to investigate further underlying factors of perception, acceptance, and enjoyment of out-of-school programming activities in relation to participants' socioeconomic background when studying children's participation of programming in school.

J	Verleysen, FT; Engels, TCE				Verleysen, Frederik T.; Engels, Tim C. E.			How arbitrary are the weights assigned to books in performance-based research funding? An empirical assessment of the weight and size of monographs in Flanders	ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Social sciences and humanities; Monograph; Performance-based research funding model; Publication size; Publication type weights; VABB-SHW	SOCIAL-SCIENCES; PUBLICATION PATTERNS; HUMANITIES; SYSTEMS	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present an empirical assessment of the weight assigned to monographs in the publication indicator of the performance-based research funding system (PRFS) in Flanders, Belgium. By relating publication weight to publication size the authors offer an alternative perspective on the production of scholars who publish monographs. This perspective on weights is linked to the aggregation level at which PRFS indicators are used: the national/regional one as opposed to the local one. In Flanders as elsewhere the publication indicator designed for funding distribution between universities has sometimes trickled down to institutions, their faculties and departments. Design/methodology/approach As an alternative indicator of scholarly production the authors propose the median number of pages of a publication type. Measuring the size of publications allows to compare the weight ratio between monographs and journal articles in the publication indicator to their size ratio in the VABB-SHW database. The authors compare two levels, one of four universities and one of 16 disciplines. Findings Median publication size differences between disciplines are much larger than those between universities. This indicates that an increase of monographs' weight in the publication indicator would hardly affect funding distribution at the regional level. Disciplines with a relatively large share of monographs, however, would contribute more to the publication indicator. Hence an increase of monographs' weight might provide a better balance between fields and between publication types. Originality/value This paper presents a thought experiment regarding the weight assigned to different publication types in the publication indicator of the Flemish PRFS: what would happen if this weight were replaced by the median number of pages of a publication type? In doing so, we highlight that such weighting schemes play an important role in finding a balance between fields of research. The sizeable differences between weight and size ratios offer a new and critical perspective on the weighting schemes currently used in PRFS, also in other countries.

In experiments mirror neurons showed activity both when a subject performed an action and when it observed the same action performed by self or another (possibly conspecific) subject. We formulate and study possible computational consequences of the hypothesis in which the experimentally observed properties of mirror neurons are generalized to other perceptive modalities and the underlying mechanism for coupling sensory and motor information is extended by an associative mechanism serving for completion of cross-modal information composed of perception and motor information. Depending on of what kind of information is completed, the hypothesis opens the door for understanding the mechanisms for sensorimotor coordination, imitation learning, and thinking and is inspiring for the design of such mechanisms in the case of artificial agents. Our results justify the hopes generally related to the discovery of mirror neurons.

This study assesses learning with these technologies in K-12 makerspaces and FabLabs. Purpose Our study describes the iterative process of developing an assessment instrument for this new technological literacy, the Exploration and Fabrication Technologies Instrument, and presents findings from implementations at five schools in three countries. Our index is generalizable and psychometrically sound, and permits comparison between student confidence and performance. Design/Method Our evaluation of distinct technology skills separates general computing, information and communication technology (ICT), and exploration and fabrication technologies (EFTs) into nonoverlapping areas of technological expertise required to perform their respective sets of tasks. The instrument also tracks student confidence in EFT skills and assesses how that confidence relates to actual task performance. Results Exploration and fabrication technologies constitute a new and distinct set of technology literacies arising from fabrication settings. The EFT instrument compares students' self-reported confidence with their performance on complex design tasks and demonstrates that, for students, exposure to general computing and ICT tools differs from exposure to EFT tools. Conclusion The EFT instrument captures a new and distinct set of technology literacies that arise within fabrication settings and are independent of both general computing and digital content production skills.

The program was developed by a multidisciplinary group and designed with large, clear illustrations and buttons. A total of 42 patients aged 51-92 years tested the program and completed afterwards a questionnaire. Three heart failure nurses evaluated how the patients used the program and their attitudes towards the computer. All patients could use the program, despite the fact that only six had used a computer before. The patients were satisfied with the computer-based information and appreciated that the program was interactive, flexible and contained a self-test. They thought it was a better way of receiving information than reading a booklet or watching a video about heart failure. The nurses reported that the patients were positive towards the computer and seemed to understand the information and that the patient education was less time-consuming, when the patients could seek knowledge on their own.

The course of neuroaesthetics was first opened in the college of life science at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), attracting 99 graduate students from 34 different majors. Students majoring in neuroscience or psychology accounted for 26.5%, those majoring in life sciences but with a relatively weak knowledge base of neuroscience accounted for 63.5%, and those majoring in science and engineering with no experience in neuroscience or psychology accounted for 10%. Therefore, in the teaching process, we should not only teach basic knowledge of neuroscience and other basic aspects to beginners, in order to better understand neuroaesthetics, but also constantly attract the interest of graduate students majoring in neuroscience. To this end, we designed a set of targeted teaching program, that is, the basic knowledge of related neuroscience is taught together with the professional content of neuroaesthetics. When introducing cutting-edge research results, pay attention to interaction and discussion with students, and then summarize for interesting viewpoints. For example, when teaching Freud's "psychological structure of personality", we introduce Maclean's "triune of brain" theory and also introduce the "diffuse regulatory system of the brain". Then "Id" is discussed corresponding to paleocortex and archicortex, "superego" to neocortex. The relation of "ego" with Id and superego is also discussed in order to stimulate students' interest in and comparative thinking of the two theories of "personality structure" and "triune of brain". Then, the visual information processing network is introduced. Finally, the creation characteristics of classic paintings are introduced, and the generation of aesthetic feeling is discussed. The content of the course analyzes aesthetic experience from the four levels of personality psychology, brain structure, neuron and molecule (neurotransmitter), and constructs a relatively broad thinking space for students. According to the learning experience submitted by students after the course, this teaching not only stimulates their interest and enthusiasm for learning neuroaesthetics, but also improves students' awareness of thinking from the perspective of aesthetics and the pursuit of beauty.

Creative ideas are not just new and unexpected, but are also successful in providing solutions that are useful, efficient and valuable. Thus, creativity optimizes the use of available resources and increases wealth. The origin of human creativity, however, is poorly understood, and semantic measures that could predict the success of generated ideas are currently unknown. Here, we analyze a dataset of design problem-solving conversations in real-world settings by using 49 semantic measures based on WordNet 3.1 and demonstrate that a divergence of semantic similarity, an increased information content, and a decreased polysemy predict the success of generated ideas. The first feedback from clients also enhances information content and leads to a divergence of successful ideas in creative problem solving. These results advance cognitive science by identifying real-world processes in human problem solving that are relevant to the success of produced solutions and provide tools for real-time monitoring of problem solving, student training and skill acquisition. A selected subset of information content (IC Sanchez-Batet) and semantic similarity (Lin/Sanchez-Batet) measures, which are both statistically powerful and computationally fast, could support the development of technologies for computer-assisted enhancements of human creativity or for the implementation of creativity in machines endowed with general artificial intelligence.

However, the spatial distribution and abundance of cats and their risk to our protected areas remains unknown. We worked with citizen scientists to survey the mammals at 2,117 sites in 32 protected areas and one urban area across 6 states in the eastern United States using camera traps. We found that most protected areas had high levels of coyote (Canis latrans) activity, but few or no domestic cats. The relative abundance of domestic cats in residential yards, where coyotes were rare, was 300 times higher than in the protected areas. Our spatial models of cat distribution show the amount of coyote activity and housing density are the best predictors of cat activity, and that coyotes and cats overlap the most in small urban forests. Coyotes were nocturnal at all sites, while cats were nocturnal in protected areas, but significantly more diurnal in urban sites. We suggest that the ecological impact of free-ranging cats in the region is concentrated in urban areas or other sites, such as islands, with few coyotes. Our study also shows the value of citizen science for conducting broadscale mammal surveys using photo-vouchered locations that ensure high data quality.

Objective: To report the design and baseline results of a quality improvement project designed to increase the use of hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with CHD in a network-model managed care setting. Methods: Patients with CHD were identified by searching a claims database. Use of-therapies was assessed by linkage with a pharmacy benefits database'. A survey was mailed to primary care physicians to collect information related to attitudes and behavioral intentions regarding aggressive management of CHD. An intervention, consisting of a guideline summary, performance feedback, and medical chart reminders, was evaluated in a randomized, practice-based trial. Results: Among 1189 patients with CHID, the median prevalence of receipt of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and ACE inhibitors across practices at baseline (the first 3 months of 1999) was 50.0%, 35.0%, and 18.8%, respectively. Reported barriers included a perception that aggressive management of CHD is thought to be unimportant by support staff yet to require significant staff time. Aggressive management of CHD was perceived to incur nonreimbursable costs, to be unimportant in their patient population, to require a great deal of patient education and self-management, and to be limited because many patients do not adhere to therapy. Conclusions: Opportunities exist for enhancing the quality of care provided to patients with CHD. Our experience to date supports the logistical feasibility of implementing network-level quality enhancement efforts in managed care networks.

Kier: A Bibliometric Exploration of his Scientific Production and its Use	CURRENT COMPUTER-AIDED DRUG DESIGN			English	Article						Bibliometrics; discourse community; drug design; Lemont B. Kier; topological descriptors; scientific community	MOLECULAR CONNECTIVITY; CHEMISTRY	We thought an appropriate way to celebrate the seminal contribution of Kier is to explore his influence on science, looking for the impact of his research through the citation of his scientific production. From a bibliometric approach the impact of Kier's work is addressed as an individual within a community. Reviewing data from his curriculum vitae, as well as from the ISI Web of Knowledge (ISI), his role within the scientific community is established and the way his scientific results circulate is studied. His curriculum vitae is explored emphasising the approaches he used in his research activities and the social ties with other actors of the community. The circulation of Kier's publications in the ISI is studied as a means for spreading and installing his discourse within the community. The citation patterns found not only show the usage of Kier's scientific results, but also open the possibility to identify some characteristics of this discursive community, such as a common vocabulary and common research goals. The results show an interdisciplinary research work that consolidates a scientific community on the topic of drug discovery.

In this paper, the author presents an empirical model that shows minimal pixel requirements for computer users to recognize things from digital photos under different contextual conditions. It is found that face recognition alone needs far fewer pixels than people normally thought. However, more pixels are needed for users to recognize objects within outdoor scenes and paintings. Color and age have effect on object recognition but the differences are not significant. The results can be applied to adaptive display design, computer vision, adaptive human-computer interaction and telecommunication system design.

To further progress our designs in fungal electronics we need to evaluate how electrical signals can be propagated through mycelium networks. We investigate the ability of mycelium-bound composites to convey electrical signals, thereby enabling the transmission of frequency-modulated information. Mycelium networks were found to reliably transfer signals with a recoverable frequency comparable to the input, in the 100 Hz to 10000 Hz frequency range. Mycelial adaptive responses, such as tissue repair, may result in fragile connections, however. While the mean amplitude of output signals was not reproducible among replicate experiments exposed to the same input frequency, the variance across groups was highly consistent. Our work is supported by NARX modelling through which an approximate transfer function was derived. These findings advance the state of the art of using mycelium-bound composites in analogue electronics and unconventional computing.

Methods: We developed an electronic questionnaire on a tablet computer incorporating prefilled answers and skip patterns. Using a randomized controlled study design, we tested the survey in a mammography clinic that administers a paper risk-factor questionnaire to every woman at her screening mammogram. We randomized 160 women to use the electronic survey (experimental group, n = 86) or paper survey (control group, n = 74). We evaluated patient acceptance and data completeness. Results: Overall, 70.4% of the experimental group women thought the survey was very easy to use, compared to 55.6% of women in the control group. Ninety percent of experimental group women preferred using the tablet, compared to the paper questionnaire. Preference for the tablet did not differ by age; however, women >= 60 years did not find the tablet as easy to use as did women < 60 years. The proportion of missing data was significantly lower on the tablet compared to the paper questionnaire (4.6% vs. 6.2%, P = .04). Conclusion: Electronic questionnaires are feasible to use in a mammography setting, can improve data quality, and are preferred by women regardless of age. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Guilbeault, D				Guilbeault, Douglas			Growing Bot Security: An Ecological View of Bot Agency	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Internet security; social bots; agency; ecology; algorithms; philosophy of information; ethics; power	SOCIAL NETWORKS; FACEBOOK; COMMUNICATION; CREDIBILITY; INFORMATION	Political actors are now deploying software programs called social bots that use social networking services such as Facebook or Twitter to communicate with users and manipulate their behavior, creating profound issues for Internet security. Current approaches in bot control continue to fail because social media platforms supply communication resources that allow bots to escape detection and enact influence. Bots become agents by harnessing profile settings, popularity measures, and automated conversation tools, along with vast amounts of user data that social media platforms make available. This article develops an ecological approach to thinking about bots that focuses on how social media environments propel bots into agency. This habitat-based model uses bots to expose ripe targets of intervention and innovation at the level of interface design. It also situates bots in the context of platform providers with a vested interest in interface design, revealing a range of new political problems. Most important, it invites a hybrid ethics, wherein humans and bots act together to solve problems in bot security and Internet ethics more broadly.

This paper firstly points out the problem that engineer thinks that Ubiquitous computing connected to network have become more complexes and distributed, but most system-related research is still focused on the 'performance' or 'efficiency'. And that most studied papers in privacy have been focused on encryption technology and protocols for securing the personal information data transaction. This paper secondly points out the problem that law-related researcher thinks that law can controller technology beyond human control. Today, due to the complexity of the problem, new privacy-related research based on total solution is integrative needed to consider laws, technology, economy, norms and so on. This paper will focus on analysis about Privacy in Ubiquitous computing Environment and total protection considerations on privacy. We present new privacy-related considerations in UC (Ubiquitous computing) Environment, point out the mechanism which new re-design privacy concept (protection scope) is affected from the UC (Ubiquitous computing) Environment and provide the total considerations for Privacy protection especially personal information protection by improve the intelligent technology applied in context aware technology.

Lorraine			Cannabis Enthusiasts' Knowledge of Medical Treatment Effectiveness and Increased Risks From Cannabis Use	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH PROMOTION			English	Article						cannabis; marijuana; education; communications; effectiveness; risk factor	MARIJUANA; LAWS	Purpose: To compare cannabis enthusiasts' knowledge about cannabis risks and effectiveness in treating medical conditions with existing empirical evidence. Design: A brief survey assessed cannabis use, information sources, and knowledge about risks and effectiveness. Setting: A cannabis advocacy event in April 2019 in a state with legal medical and recreational cannabis. Participants: Demographically diverse adults (N = 472) who frequently used cannabis; 85% used cannabis for health or medical purposes. Measures: Participants reported the sources of their cannabis information, health conditions they thought cannabis was effective in treating (n = 10), and health risks increased by cannabis (n = 6). Conditions and risks were based on ratings of evidence (ie, from substantial to insufficient) for therapeutic effects and risks identified in a review by The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM, 2017). Analyses: Chi-square tests examined the correspondence between participants' knowledge and NASEM conclusions. Results: Most participants' (95% confidence interval [CI]: 74%-81%) knowledge of cannabis was from their own experiences; 18% (95% CI: 14%-21%) received information from primary care providers. On average, participants' beliefs matched NASEM conclusions for half of effectiveness (95% CI: 50%-53%) and risk items (95% CI: 55%-57%). Many (95% CI: 38%-42%) thought that cannabis use did not increase any risk. Contrary to NASEM conclusions, many thought cannabis was effective in treating cancer (76%), depressive symptoms (72%), and epilepsy (68%). Those who received cannabis information from their primary care providers had better knowledge of medical effectiveness. Medicinal cannabis use frequency inversely predicted knowledge of medical effectiveness and increased risks of adverse events. Conclusion: There were considerable discrepancies between cannabis users' knowledge and available evidence, highlighting the need for more research and education (by physicians, caregivers, and dispensaries) on effectiveness and health risks, especially for users with specific health issues such as pregnant women and people with depression.

The techniques that allow machines to learn and get better at tasks such as recognition and prediction, which form the basis of clinical practice, are referred to as machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. The number of artificial intelligence -and machine learnings-related publications in clinical journals has grown exponentially, driven by recent developments in computation and the accessibility of simple tools. However, clinicians are often not included in data science teams, which may limit the clinical relevance, explanability, workflow compatibility, and quality improvement of artificial intelligence solutions. Thus, this results in the language barrier between clinicians and artificial intelligence developers. Healthcare practitioners sometimes lack a basic understanding of artificial intelligence research because the approach is difficult for non-specialists to understand. Furthermore, many editors and reviewers of medical publications might not be familiar with the fundamental ideas behind these technologies, which may prevent journals from publishing high-quality artificial intelligence studies or, worse still, could allow for the publication of low-quality works. In this review, we aim to improve readers' artificial intelligence literacy and critical thinking. As a result, we concentrated on what we consider the 10 most important qualities of artificial intelligence research: valid scientific purpose, high-quality data set, robust reference standard, robust input, no information leakage, optimal bias-variance tradeoff, proper model evaluation, proven clinical utility, transparent reporting, and open science. Before designing a study, one should have defined a sound scientific purpose. Then, it should be backed by a high-quality data set, robust input, and a solid reference standard. The artificial intelligence development pipeline should prevent information leakage. For the models, optimal bias-variance tradeoff should be achieved, and generalizability assessment must be adequately performed. The clinical value of the final models must also be established. After the study, thought should be given to transparency in publishing the process and results as well as open science for sharing data, code, and models. We hope this work may improve the artificial intelligence literacy and mindset of the readers.

We used a design-based research approach in which we, together with the teachers, created a maker space for explorative science learning and organised teaching interventions wherein the pupils met online three hours a week for 16 weeks for an entire school year. Due to COVID-19, data were collected through Zoom, with collaborative learning situations captured through screen sharing and online communication using webcams. We employed three data analysis techniques: interaction analysis, visual artifact analysis, and thematic analysis. We developed an analytical framework for integration using thematic coding that combined concepts from computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) and domai-oriented design environments. We report the following findings: 1) Three types of rules between design units were identified with visual artifact analysis: latent, generic, and domai-specific rules; 2) two types of CSCL artifacts (technology and discussions) were intertwined and developed in parallel, along with a computer-based scaffolding scenario that offloads domai-specific scaffolding from humans to computers.

Previous research has shown disparities in COVID-19 vaccination uptake among HCWs based on ethnicity, job role, sex, age, and deprivation. However, vaccine attitudes underpinning these variations and factors influencing these attitudes are yet to be fully explored. Methods We conducted a qualitative study with 164 HCWs from different ethnicities, sexes, job roles, migration statuses, and regions in the United Kingdom (UK). Interviews and focus groups were conducted online or telephonically, and recorded with participants' permission. Recordings were transcribed and a two-pronged analytical approach was adopted: content analysis for categorising vaccine attitudes and thematic analysis for identifying factors influencing vaccine attitudes. Findings We identified four different COVID-19 vaccine attitudes among HCWs: Active Acceptance, Passive Acceptance, Passive Decline, and Active Decline. Content analysis of the transcripts showed that HCWs from ethnic minority communities and female HCWs were more likely to either decline (actively/passively) or passively accept vaccination-reflecting hesitancy. Factors influencing these attitudes included: trust; risk perception; social influences; access and equity; considerations about the future. Interpretation Our data show that attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine are diverse, and elements of hesitancy may persist even after uptake. This has implications for the sustainability of the COVID-19 vaccine programme, particularly as new components (for example boosters) are being offered. We also found that vaccine attitudes differed by ethnicity, sex and job role, which calls for an intersectional and dynamic approach for improving vaccine uptake among HCWs. Trust, risk perception, social influences, access and equity and future considerations all influence vaccine attitudes and have a bearing on HCWs' decision about accepting or declining the COVID-19 vaccine. Based on our findings, we recommend building trust, addressing structural inequities and, designing inclusive and accessible information to address hesitancy.

J	Zhang, TD; Dai, JG; Li, Y; Zhang, YL				Zhang, Tengda; Dai, Jiguang; Li, Yan; Zhang, Yilei			Vector data partition correction method supported by deep learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Zoning thought; vector correction; deep learning; urban road; rural road	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; ROAD CENTERLINE EXTRACTION; SEGMENTATION; CONFLATION; IMAGERY; UPDATE; MAPS	Road vector data are an important part of geographic information databases and play a leading role in social and economic development. Among them, the accuracy and current situation of vector data are the key values of their application. In recent years, with the development of remote sensing technology, remote sensing images contain increasingly more road information, which provides a large number of available features for the establishment of vector correction models. Therefore, the vector-to-image vector correction method based on remote sensing images has become an important means to ensure the accuracy and current situation of vector data. However, in actual scenes, there are great differences in the design structure and design index between urban roads and rural roads, which is reflected in the serious spatial heterogeneity between them in the remote sensing images. Therefore, when the existing methods use remote sensing images for vector correction, the universality is limited by the change of regional scenes, so it is difficult to realize the simultaneous correction of urban road and rural road vectors, with poor applicability and low compatibility. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a vector data partition correction method supported by deep learning. First, the U-2-net model and line segment sequence method are used to generate the feature set. Second, according to the characteristics of the poor quality of urban road extraction results, the regular geometric form of vector data and the poor structural information of road images, the methods of vector line decomposition, subvector line correction, subvector line centralization and vector line synthesis are proposed to correct the vector lines of urban roads. Finally, according to the characteristics of high-quality rural road extraction, the irregular geometric form of vector data and the strong information of road image structures, this paper proposes road edge extraction, a road centreline reasoning model and a vector line connection method to complete the correction of rural vector road data. The quantitative analysis of the experimental results shows that compared with other methods, the urban road vector correction method in this paper is much better than the comparison methods and has achieved better correction results in rural areas. This method has the advantages of compatibility and better accuracy for roads in different areas.

J	Wang, ZY; Wang, L				Wang, Ziyuan; Wang, Li			An Attention Approach for Dimensionality Reduction That Can Correct Feature Collection Skewness	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Feature extraction; Dimensionality reduction; Tensors; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Three-dimensional displays; Convolutional neural network; attention mechanism; feature extraction network		It has been demonstrated that adding an attention mechanism to a convolutional neural network enhances network performance. However, in practice, the skewness error during the extraction process affects the feature information owing to the implementation of the global average pooling operation, which eventually lowers the performance of the network design. We think that when the weight is activated, the spatial information is effectively captured while the extraction range of the channel information is narrowed. We also think that because the weight is activated using multiple local extraction substitutions, the influence of skewness error can be effectively reduced. As a result, we suggest dimensionality reduction attention(RA) in this study as a new type of attention mechanism. Dimensionality reduction attention is a method of combining spatial information and channel information into a new feature distribution by aggregating dimensionality reduction of feature information, in contrast to other attentions that act on distinct feature tensors in space and channel. Under the premise of capturing long-distance context information and guaranteeing feature coordinates, it may realize the locality of spatial information through this operation and identify the local information of each channel. To completely display the important feature information, the produced feature maps are then encoded into two complimentary attention maps along the spatial and channel directions, respectively. Our dimension reduction focus is a straightforward and all-encompassing module. We run tests on various datasets using various deep architectures and various class designs. The outcomes of the trial demonstrate that our attention-based approach has clear benefits.

Quantum communication-the ability to transmit quantum information-is a primitive necessary for any quantum internet. At its core, quantum communication generally requires the formation of entangled links between remote locations. The performance of these links is limited by the classical signalling time between such locations, necessitating the need for long-lived quantum memories. Here, we present the design of a communications network that neither requires the establishment of entanglement between remote locations nor the use of long-lived quantum memories. The rate at which quantum data can be transmitted along the network is only limited by the time required to perform efficient local gate operations.

Considering the role of nurses in healthcare, it is shocking that there is a lack of evaluations of nursing information systems in the literature. Here we report on how a human factors approach can be used to address barriers and facilitators to use of the nursing information system (NIS). Human factors engineering (HFE) approaches provide the theoretical and methodological underpinning to address these socio-technical issues. Methods: This study investigated the use of an NIS, a module of the electronic health record (EHR) previously implemented throughout the hospital system. The study took place in two hospitals (760 beds and 300 beds) within a three-hospital health system. Earlier in the year, the NIS was implemented throughout the health system. We applied a scenario-based evaluation technique in order to understand the barriers and facilitators to nurse use of the NIS as part of improving the healthcare delivery system. The scenarios were designed to have the nurses interact with the major components of the NIS. The research team developed the standardized scenarios to cover the major functions of the system. Results: Twelve nurses completed the study and results show that documentation within the NIS was hindered by several aspects of the interface. This paper discusses the themes associated with the usability of the NIS interface analyzing them using usability heuristics. The team also identified facilitators to use and proposed avenues to support or enhance these facilitators. Conclusions: This study examined the use of an NIS to standardize care and documentation in nursing. It used scenario-based usability testing, applying the "think-aloud" protocol technique to assess the use of the NIS in documenting patient care. This method of usability evaluation exposed an understanding of how nurses use the NIS and their perspective on the system. We hypothesize that this method will offer key insights into how the usability of the NIS not only impacts use but also informs redesign opportunities. In addition, this is one of the few rigorous studies of NIS and provides direction and recommendations for informaticians, developers and nurse decision makers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Educators have to evolve innovative pedagogy to help prepare this generation for future challenges as the training periods are getting relatively shorter. Flipped classroom or Inverted classroom is one such innovation that can empower a learner to develop critical thinking skills and master ways to imbibe vast information by engaging students in active learning process. Reading and understanding are carried at home, and the class-time is utilized for higher levels of learning like analyzing, evaluating, and application of the basic information. This review article is aimed to guide the educators in applying the concept of flipped classroom in their teaching learning armamentarium.

Inspired by the thought of granular computing, this article proposes a new hesitant fuzzy linguistic method to deal with issues when a lot of decision makers provide hesitant and uncertain preference information in the decision-making process. First, we design a multiplicative consistency index and calculate its thresholds corresponding to different dimensions of preference matrix by the Monte Carlo experiment. Then, we construct a hesitant fuzzy linguistic model with granularity level, so as to recharacterize original assessment information and improve the consistency of preference matrices as far as possible. Considering the features of some large-scale group decision-making situation, where the decision makers have little opportunity to take part in multiple consensus reaching processes, hesitant fuzzy linguistic fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm is developed to integrate the assessment information given by decision makers. Finally, the final decision-making results are derived. An illustrative example of assessing psychological situation of some COVID-19 infected persons clarifies the reasonability of the proposed method. Finally, we complete some comparative studies and simulation experiments to demonstrate the method's validity and advantages.

Coupled with academic skills challenges, these difficulties can lead to decreased academic performance, low levels of study satisfaction, and eventually drop out. Student support services are facing budget cuts and can only attend to limited numbers of students, usually the ones who present with more severe mental health problems. Moreover, face-to-face contact may not appeal to those students who feel embarrassed by their problems or are afraid of being stigmatised. To address this important problem, an online psychological wellbeing and study skills support system called MePlusMe, has been developed to provide personalised support to its users. In the present study we investigated the feasibility and acceptability of the contents, design, and functionalities of the system.MethodsAn offline version of the system was introduced to 13 postgraduate and undergraduate students (mean age=31.3 years, SD=10.25 years; 4 males) in a UK HE Institution, who presented with mild or moderate mental health difficulties. The participants evaluated the design of the system, its functionalities, and contents at Baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, and 8.ResultsParticipants found the system easy to use, professional, and efficient and its contents non-judgemental and informative. Participants stated that engaging with and practicing the techniques targeted at mental health difficulties led to improvements in positive thinking and self-confidence, while the study skills techniques were practical. Suggestions for further improvement included the development of an app and an option for direct engagement with professionals.ConclusionsThe findings confirmed the acceptability of the contents, design and functionalities of the system, while providing useful information to inform its further development. Next steps include a feasibility study, which will test and quantify the effects on everyday functioning, mood, mental wellbeing, and academic self-efficacy after using the system, and subsequently a randomized controlled trial, which will evaluate its effectiveness.

J	EAGAN, PD; VENTURA, SJ				EAGAN, PD; VENTURA, SJ			ENHANCING VALUE OF ENVIRONMENTAL DATA - DATA LINEAGE REPORTING	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article								Concerns about environmental data quality and the need for data documentation are increasing due to increased accessibility to and demand for environmental data. Local, state, and federal agencies as well as consultants, researchers, and the public are interested in current, reliable, accessible, and understandable data. It is often necessary to rely on data obtained from secondary sources, originally collected for purposes other than present applications. Information describing form, specificity, and processing are needed, in addition to assessment of data quality, to make informed decisions about the usefulness of secondhand data. This paper merges the thinking of environmental sciences and spatial information systems, and presents an initial proposal tor an environmental data lineage report. The proposal describes two kinds of information needed in a lineage report-an overview of the data collection process, and an overview of relevant legal and organizational factors driving the data collection. rhe process description includes information about sample design, site conditions. instrument calibration, data recording and processing, and so forth. Description of legal and organizational factors such as laws, decision criteria, and existing standardS explain the original purpose for data collection.

Participants were presented with word pairs, consisting of everyday objects and uses for these objects, which had to be judged based on the two defining criteria of creative products: unusualness and appropriateness. Three subject-determined trial types resulted from this judgement: high unusual and low appropriate (nonsensical uses), low unusual and high appropriate (common uses), and high unusual and high appropriate (creative uses). Word pairs of the creative uses type are held to passively induce conceptual expansion. The N400 component was not specifically modulated by conceptual expansion but was, instead, generally responsive as a function of unusualness or novelty of the stimuli (nonsense=creative>common). Explorative analyses in a later time window (500-900 ms) revealed that ERP activity in this phase indexes appropriateness (nonsense>creative=common). In the discussion of these findings with reference to the literature on semantic cognition, both components are proposed as indexing processes relevant to conceptual expansion as they are selectively involved in the encoding and integration of a newly established semantic connection between two previously unrelated concepts.

J	Yang, LH				Yang, Lihua			Developing collaboration between research-oriented and practice-oriented experts in public administration: How does expert participation make a difference in public policy making and governance practice?	PUBLIC POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						Collaboration; institutional design principles; practice; practice-oriented experts; research-oriented experts	SOCIAL-SCIENCE; THINK TANKS; DESERTIFICATION CONTROL; KNOWLEDGE; MANAGEMENT; GOVERNMENT; FRAMEWORK; TYPOLOGY; CHINA	The contradiction between experts' research (or theory) and practitioners' practice has plagued public administration for over a century. However, this study emphasizes that experts themselves are not exactly the same. To address the contradiction between research and practice and to improve the role of experts, we need not only to improve the collaboration between experts and practitioners but also to strengthen the collaboration between research-oriented and practice-oriented experts. Using desertification control experiences in 12 counties in northern China as policy examples and through case studies and analysis of a survey of more than 4000 individuals, the study finds that the collaboration with high participation of both research-oriented and practice-oriented experts had the highest governance performance, due to reducing information and knowledge asymmetry, enhancing trust, and strengthening expert participation in public governance. The study also reveals that there are eight institutional design principles that are important for the success of experts' participation. These principles emphasized knowledge and experts themselves, experts' relationship with other social actors, and external support (support from laws and regulations and financial support). The study is enlightening to policy makers and public administrators in their endeavor to integrate research (theory) and practice, design public policy, and maximize the use of their knowledge and expertise to advance the cause of public administration.

J	van de Ven, I				van de Ven, Inge			Attentional modulation in literary reading: A theoretical-empirical framework	ORBIS LITTERARUM			English	Article; Early Access						attention; close reading; hyperreading; mind-wandering; modulation	INFORMATION; TIME; DIGITIZATION; READERS; TEXTS	When we think of a person engaged in the act of reading literary fiction, the mental image that readily comes to mind is one of focused concentration. In our current information age, such a form of reading seems especially necessary, and often lacking. This causes a change in how we read, often described in terms of close reading versus hyperreading. Literary reading is typically associated with the former; screen-based reading of information texts with the latter. Accounts of attention and distraction in reading research are often informed by a binary way of thinking. Literary reading, while often aligned with close reading, also involves selection, strategic allocation of attention informed by textual cues, condensation, and mind-wandering. It never occurs in a state of continuous attention: we combine different modes, triggered by both textual and readerly characteristics. A challenge for literary studies in the present media landscape is to determine more precisely when readers read with close attention and when they skim, or what they skip. This article presents a theoretical contribution to studies of literary reading in the form of a literature review and a framework for attentional modulation. Education might benefit from a more sophisticated concept of such attentional modulations.

J	Rundgren, CJ; Eriksson, M; Rundgren, SNC				Rundgren, Carl-Johan; Eriksson, Martin; Rundgren, Shu-Nu Chang			Investigating the Intertwinement of Knowledge, Value, and Experience of Upper Secondary Students' Argumentation Concerning Socioscientific Issues	SCIENCE & EDUCATION			English	Article							SCIENCE; PATTERNS; FRAMEWORK; THINKING; REASONS	This study aims to explore students' argumentation and decision-making relating to an authentic socioscientific issue (SSI)-the problem of environmental toxins in fish from the Baltic Sea. A multi-disciplinary instructional module, designed in order to develop students' skills to argue about complex SSI, was successfully tested. Seven science majors in the final year of their upper secondary studies participated in this study. Their argumentation and decision-making processes were followed closely, and data were collected during multiple stages of the instructional module: group discussions were audio recorded, the participants wrote reports on their decision making, and postexercise interviews were conducted with individual students. The analysis focused on the skill of evaluation demonstrated by the students during the exercise and the relationships between the knowledge, values, and experiences that they used in their argumentation. Even though all of the students had access to the same information and agreed on the factual aspects of the issue, they came to different decisions. All of the students took counter-arguments and the limitations of their claims into account and were able to extend their claims where appropriate. However, their decisions differed depending on their background knowledge, values, and experiences (i.e., their intellectual baggage). The implication to SSI teaching and learning is discussed.

J	Butcher, KR; Sumner, T				Butcher, Kirsten R.; Sumner, Tamara			Self-Directed Learning and the Sensemaking Paradox	HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION			English	Article							COGNITIVE TUTORS; KNOWLEDGE; COMPREHENSION; MODEL; TEXT; HYPERMEDIA; RECALL; SENSE	Educative sensemaking focuses on the needs of self-directed learners, a nonexpert population of thinkers who must locate relevant information sources, evaluate the applicability and accuracy of digital resources for learning, and determine how and when to use these resources to complete educational tasks. Self-directed learners face a sensemaking paradox: They must employ deep-level thinking skills to process information sources meaningfully, but they often lack the requisite domain knowledge needed to deeply analyze information sources and to successfully integrate incoming information with their own existing knowledge. In this article, we focus on the needs of college-aged students engaged in learning about natural sciences using web-based learning resources. We explored the impact of cognitive personalization technologies on students' sensemaking processes using a controlled study in which students' cognitive and metacognitive processes were analyzed as they completed a common educational task: writing an essay. We coded students' observable on-screen behaviors, self-reported processes, final essays, and responses to domain assessments to assess benefits of personalization technologies on students' educative sensemaking. Results show that personalization supported students' analysis of knowledge representations, helped students work with their representations in meaningful ways, and supported effective encoding of new knowledge. We discuss implications for new technologies to help students overcome the educative sensemaking paradox.

J	Kranz, J; Baur, A; Möller, A				Kranz, Johanna; Baur, Armin; Moeller, Andrea			Learners' challenges in understanding and performing experiments: a systematic review of the literature	STUDIES IN SCIENCE EDUCATION			English	Review						Challenges; experiment; inquiry-based learning; learners; literature review	SCIENCE-EDUCATION; RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS; SCIENTIFIC THINKING; STUDENTS ABILITY; PRIOR KNOWLEDGE; GUIDED INQUIRY; ELEMENTARY; DISCOVERY; SKILLS; STRATEGIES	In today's world shaped by technology and the natural sciences, knowledge and skills related to experimentation are crucial, especially given growing public debates about science-related topics. Despite a strong emphasis on experimentation in science curricula worldwide, learners still encounter diverse challenges when experimenting. This paper provides a systematic review of empirical research on learners' challenges during the following inquiry phases: stating research questions, generating hypotheses, planning and conducting an experiment, analysing data and drawing conclusions. A database search and an analysis of two prior narrative literature reviews identified 368 studies, of which 66 were used for further analyses after screening for eligibility using specific inclusion criteria. The analyses revealed 43 challenges at the conceptual, procedural and epistemic level that not only elementary but even university students face during experimentation. Additionally, cognitive biases and preconceptions are identified as a source of such challenges. Overall, the findings demonstrate a lack of in-depth research on stating research questions despite its importance for experimentation, whilst learners' abilities in the other inquiry phases have been intensively investigated. The results offer valuable information for science education research and provide a basis for tailored scaffolding in the science classroom or the design of effective instructional interventions.

Brian			A Survey of Applications Research on Content-Centric Networking	CHINA COMMUNICATIONS			English	Review						Content-centric networking (CCN); named-data networking (NDN); applications; information-centric networking; future Internet	SERVICES; DESIGN	As a named data-based clean-slate future Internet architecture, Content-Centric Networking (CCN) uses entirely different protocols and communication patterns from the host-to-host IP network. In CCN, communication is wholly driven by the data consumer. Consumers must send Interest packets with the content name and not by the host's network address. Its nature of in-network caching, Interest packets aggregation and hop-by-hop communication poses unique challenges to provision of Internet applications, where traditional IP network no long works well. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art application research activities related to CCN architecture. Our main aims in this survey are (a) to identify the advantages and drawbacks of CCN architectures for application provisioning; (b) to discuss the challenges and opportunities regarding service provisioning in CCN architectures; and (c) to further encourage deeper thinking about design principles for future Internet architectures from the perspective of upper-layer applications.

J	Gorichanaz, T				Gorichanaz, Tim			Virtuous search: A framework for intellectual virtue in online search	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access							INFORMATION LITERACY; HIGHER-EDUCATION; SEEKING; GOOGLE; SKILLS	This paper presents a conceptual framework for the intellectual virtues in the context of online search. Intellectual virtues are dispositions and skills that enable good thinking and wise reasoning, such as intellectual humility and attentiveness. Despite their importance, today the intellectual virtues tend to be underdeveloped across society. In light of the institutional role that online search plays in life today, there is an opportunity (perhaps an obligation) for online search to facilitate the development of intellectual virtue. The framework presented in this paper locates this development in three areas: the Searcher, the System, and Society. Major issues in information ethics and virtue epistemology are discussed for each of these areas, leading to recommendations for education, design, and research. This paper provides specific suggestions in this regard along with an agenda for future research at the intersection of ethics, epistemology, and online search.

J	Lukacevic, F; Becattini, N; Perisic, MM; Skec, S				Lukacevic, Fanika; Becattini, Niccolo; Perisic, Marija Majda; Skec, Stanko			Differences in engineers' brain activity when CAD modelling from isometric and orthographic projections	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EEG; TASKS	A way of presenting information in visual representations of technical systems influences the progress and the outcome of the engineering design process. Consequently, improving the means by and through which information is utilised during the process is one suggested approach to advancing engineering design. Engineers' interaction with visual representations of technical systems is mainly visual and virtual. Although such interactions are cognitively complex, little is known about cognition (mental information processing) underlying the utilisation of design information during engineering design. To narrow the research gap, this study explores how visual representations of technical systems affect engineers' brain activity while generating computer-aided design (CAD) models based on them. More precisely, the brain activity of 20 engineers is captured and analysed using electroencephalography (EEG) during the visuospatially-intensive design tasks of CAD modelling in two conditions; when technical systems are presented with orthographic and isometric projections in technical drawings. The results imply the sensitivity of engineers' brain activity in CAD modelling to the visual representation from which a technical system is interpreted. In particular, significant differences are found in theta, alpha, and beta task-related power (TRP) over the cortex when interpreting the technical drawings and CAD modelling from them. Furthermore, the results reveal significant differences in theta and alpha TRP when considering the individual electrodes, the cortical hemispheres, and the cortical areas. In particular, theta TRP over the right hemisphere and the frontal area seems essential in distinguishing neurocognitive responses to the orthographic and isometric projections. As such, the conducted exploratory study sets the foundations for exploring engineers' brain activity while performing visuospatially-intensive design tasks, whose segments are relatable to the aspects of visuospatial thinking. Future work will explore brain activity in other design activities that are highly visuospatial, with a larger sample size and an EEG device of a higher spatial resolution.

This paper examines patient and public views about the security and privacy of EHRs used for health provision, research and policy in the UK. Methods: Sequential mixed methods study with a cross-sectional survey (in 2011) followed by focus group discussions (in 2012-2013). Survey participants (N = 5331) were recruited from primary and secondary care settings in West London (UK). Complete data for 2761 (51.8 %) participants were included in the final analysis for this paper. The survey results were discussed in 13 focus groups with people living with a range of different health conditions, and in 4 mixed focus groups with patients, health professionals and researchers (total N = 120). Qualitative data were analysed thematically. Results: In the survey, 79 % of participants reported that they would worry about the security of their record if this was part of a national EHR system and 71 % thought the National Health Service (NHS) was unable to guarantee EHR safety at the time this work was carried out. Almost half (47 %) responded that EHRs would be less secure compared with the way their health record was held at the time of the survey. Of those who reported being worried about EHR security, many would nevertheless support their development (55 %), while 12 % would not support national EHRs and a sizeable proportion (33 %) were undecided. There were also variations by age, ethnicity and education. In focus group discussions participants weighed up perceived benefits against potential security and privacy threats from wider sharing of information, as well as discussing other perceived risks: commercial exploitation, lack of accountability, data inaccuracies, prejudice and inequalities in health provision. Conclusions: Patient and public worries about the security risks associated with integrated EHRs highlight the need for intensive public awareness and engagement initiatives, together with the establishment of trustworthy security and privacy mechanisms for health information sharing.

Powerful visualization systems may be inflexible or impose abstractions foreign to visual thinking, while graphical systems such as rendering APIs and vector-based drawing programs are tedious for complex work. We argue that an easy-to-use graphical system tailored for visualization is needed. In response, we contribute Protovis, an extensible toolkit for constructing visualizations by composing simple graphical primitives. In Protovis, designers specify visualizations as a hierarchy of marks with visual properties defined as functions of data. This representation achieves a level of expressiveness comparable to low-level graphics systems, while improving efficiency-the effort required to specify a visualization-and accessibility-the effort required to learn and modify the representation. We substantiate this claim through a diverse collection of examples and comparative analysis with popular visualization tools.

J	Pereno, A; Eriksson, D				Pereno, Amina; Eriksson, Daniel			A multi-stakeholder perspective on sustainable healthcare: From 2030 onwards	FUTURES			English	Article						Sustainable healthcare; Collaborative foresight; Systemic design; Multi-stakeholder systems; Socio-technical transitions	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DESIGN THINKING; FORESIGHT; PATIENT; TRANSITION; INSIGHTS; SYSTEMS; DOCTOR; MODEL; CHAIN	Over the past years, the interest in sustainable healthcare has been growing globally and the transition toward environmentally, economically and socially viable health systems is perceived as inevitable and necessary. All the approaches to this emerging field are mainly focusing on short-term specific issues and involving a limited number of stakeholders. This study aimed to address the topic of the possible futures of sustainable healthcare from a multi-stakeholder perspective, in order to define a long-term scenario and the key strategies to enhance this transition. A series of workshops have involved a representative selection of stakeholders based in Nordic countries and concerned with sustainable healthcare (health industries, health providers, managing authorities, universities and research centres, clusters, NGOs and healthcare networks, professional consortia) through a collaborative foresight process. A design-based approach has been adopted to investigate the current scenario and deepen foresight outcomes. The results highlighted three different horizons and the drivers to reshape the roles of individual stakeholders, enhancing the socio-technical transition towards a desirable scenario based on collaboration between distributed dynamic networks. The identified transition strategies move from the local to the international level, focusing on innovation, information and collaboration between stakeholders. This study provides the framework for future studies to deepen the transition process towards sustainable healthcare and its implications at Nordics, European and international levels.

An enactive approach to the virtual memory palace	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Article						Method of loci; Enactivism; Functionalism; Extended mind; Virtual reality; Embodied cognition; Anti-representationalism	CONTEXT-DEPENDENT MEMORY; ENVIRONMENTS; PERFORMANCE; REALITY; BRAIN; FLESH; MIND	In this paper, we evaluate the pragmatic turn towards embodied, enactive thinking in cognitive science, in the context of recent empirical research on the memory palace technique. The memory palace is a powerful method for remembering yet it faces two problems. First, cognitive scientists are currently unable to clarify its efficacy. Second, the technique faces significant practical challenges to its users. Virtual reality devices are sometimes presented as a way to solve these practical challenges, but currently fall short of delivering on that promise. We address both issues in this paper. First, we argue that an embodied, enactive approach to memory can better help us understand the effectiveness of the memory palace. Second, we present design recommendations for a virtual memory palace. Our theoretical proposal and design recommendations contribute to solving both problems and provide reasons for preferring an embodied, enactive account over an information-processing treatment of the memory palace.

Some medications are imbued with social and cultural meaning, such as stigmatized medications for opioid use disorders. Such perceptions surrounding substance use treatments can extend to the research context and shape RCT participants' experiences with and adherence to study medications. Methods: Considering these complexities in substance use research, we conducted a nested qualitative study within a multi-site, pragmatic RCT in Canada testing two treatments (methadone versus buprenorphine/ naloxone) for opioid use disorder. Between 2017 and 2020, we conducted 115 interviews with 75 RCT participants across five trial sites in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec. Results: Using an abductive coding approach, we characterized participants by their previous experience with medication for opioid use disorder and by their exposure to drug culture and drug scenes. Across these experience types, we identified systematic differences around participants' perceptions of the study medications, sources of information and expertise, and medication stigma. Conclusion: Our findings illustrate the critical importance of social context in shaping medication beliefs and study experiences among people who use drugs, with implications for the conduct of future RCTs in substance use.

One system, P123-g-PEI(2K), a cationic graft block copolymer, is of particular interest as it has been demonstrated to successfully deliver genetic material to murine liver following systemic delivery [Nguyen, H. K., Lemieux, P., Vinogradov, S. V., Gebhart, C. L., Guerin, N., Paradis, G., Bronich, T. K., Alakhov, V.Y., and Kabanov, A. V. (2000) Evaluation of Polyether-Polyethyleneimine Graft Copolymers as Gene Transfer Agents. Gene Ther. 7, 126-138 (1)]. The P123-g-PEI(2K) system requires nonmodified Pluronic P123 as an excipient to stabilize the dispersion. The purpose of the current work was to more closely characterize this system, to assess the role of each component of the system to the overall transfection process. We evaluated particle size, stability, and resistance to nuclease degradation. In addition, cellular uptake and localization of plasmid, as well as transgene expression, were evaluated following in vitro transfection of prostate cancer cells (PC-3) with various individual components of the system. Nonmodified Pluronic alone did not significantly enhance DNA uptake, transgene expression, or DNase protection. Therefore, we conclude that nonmodified Pluronic acted primarily by optimizing the size of the polyplex. Furthermore, though this system displays several characteristics thought desirable of a nonviral gene delivery system, these studies did discriminate a potential limitation of this system for in vivo applications, namely, the insufficient level of protection of plasmid DNA from nuclease degradation. This may limit the effective dose delivered, as well as limiting the effective circulation time. These studies provide vital information that will guide modification of this system to enhance the current in vivo profile.

Resampling reduces bias amplification in experimental social networks	NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR			English	Article; Early Access							FACT-CHECKING; NEWS; INFORMATION; MEDIA; DIFFUSION; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS; PARADOX; SCIENCE	Large-scale social networks are thought to contribute to polarization by amplifying people's biases. However, the complexity of these technologies makes it difficult to identify the mechanisms responsible and evaluate mitigation strategies. Here we show under controlled laboratory conditions that transmission through social networks amplifies motivational biases on a simple artificial decision-making task. Participants in a large behavioural experiment showed increased rates of biased decision-making when part of a social network relative to asocial participants in 40 independently evolving populations. Drawing on ideas from Bayesian statistics, we identify a simple adjustment to content-selection algorithms that is predicted to mitigate bias amplification by generating samples of perspectives from within an individual's network that are more representative of the wider population. In two large experiments, this strategy was effective at reducing bias amplification while maintaining the benefits of information sharing. Simulations show that this algorithm can also be effective in more complex networks. Hardy and co-authors present a resampling strategy in social networks that is effective at reducing bias amplification while maintaining the benefits of information sharing.

Thirty-seven participants between the ages of 19 and 35years were recruited. Each participant was scanned and a virtual model was made from the scan. Participants completed a questionnaire and were interviewed after completing a simulated online shopping experience that used 3D virtual simulation technology. Participants thought the visual information from the virtual model was a good starting point for judging fit. However, participants also found some inaccuracies in what they viewed on the screen. Despite the fact that the technology was not yet perfectly accurate, many participants thought the virtual model was impressive and they were likely to use it in the future. Some concerns about using the technology were raised including privacy issues, availability of technology, and discomfort of viewing one's own body scan.

This library has the potential to target and cleave any possible RNA substrate. Mouse fibroblasts transduced with this ribozyme gene vector library were selected in a focus formation assay to isolate in vivo functional ribozymes that promote cell transformation in tissue culture. After two successive rounds of selection by focus formation assay, a transforming ribozyme (Rz007) was identified. The sequence of this ribozyme was used to identify the putative target genes responsible for the transformation, A candidate gene target for Rz007 encodes telomerase reverse transcriptase (mTERT), Both mRNA level and enzymatic activity of mTERT were down-regulated in Rz007-transformed cells. Furthermore, newly designed ribozymes, recognizing other potential ribozyme cleavage sites unique to the mTERT mRNA, also cause cell transformation, thus validating the role of mTERT in suppressing the transformation phenotype. These surprising results suggest that the commonly accepted role of telomerase in maintaining cellular immortalization is more complicated than previously thought. These studies also demonstrate the utility of this novel 'reverse' functional genomics approach, enabling the targeted discovery of genes, whether previously known or not, that are Involved in any selectable phenotype.

Physicians and drug representatives: Exploring the dynamics of the relationship	JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						physician behavior; professionalism; social science; qualitative research; health policy	CONFLICTS-OF-INTEREST; PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY; MEDICINE RESIDENTS; GIFTS; ATTITUDES; FACULTY; COMPANIES	BACKGROUND: Interactions between physicians and drug representatives are common, even though research shows that physicians understand the conflict of interest between marketing and patient care. Little is known about how physicians resolve this contradiction. OBJECTIVE: To determine physicians' techniques for managing cognitive inconsistencies within their relationships with drug representatives. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Six focus groups were conducted with 32 academic and community physicians in San Diego, Atlanta, and Chicago. MEASUREMENTS: Qualitative analysis of focus group transcripts to determine physicians' attitudes towards conflict of interest and detailing, their beliefs about the quality of information conveyed and the impact on prescribing, and their resolution of the conflict between detailers' desire to sell product and patient care. RESULTS: Physicians understood the concept of conflict of interest and applied it to relationships with detailers. However, they maintained favorable views of physician-detailer exchanges. Holding these mutually contradictory attitudes, physicians were in a position of cognitive dissonance. To resolve the dissonance, they used a variety of denials and rationalizations: They avoided thinking about the conflict of interest, they disagreed that industry relationships affected physician behavior, they denied responsibility for the problem, they enumerated techniques for remaining impartial, and they reasoned that meetings with detailers were educational and benefited patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although physicians understood the concept of conflict of interest, relationships with detailers set up psychological dynamics that influenced their reasoning. Our findings suggest that voluntary guidelines, like those proposed by most major medical societies, are inadequate. It may be that only the prohibition of physician-detailer interactions will be effective.

Although approximately 80% of adults are optimistic, childhood optimism is understudied. A racially and socioeconomically diverse community sample of 152 three- to six-year-old children participated in two experiments (one story-based, one numeric probability-based) that assessed expectations of event outcomes when the likelihood of the outcome occurring either matched or conflicted with the most desirable outcome. The results systematically demonstrate that children are optimistic, even more optimistic for themselves than others, and increasingly integrate probabilistic information into their predictions with age. Differences in optimism were found in children from different socioeconomic backgrounds and those with different levels of depressive symptoms. These findings provide insight into how children reason about the future and elucidate key factors that impact optimistic predictions in childhood.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a rational delegation machine learning pattern. In the proposed pattern, we firstly construct a reliable game model, and then build a formal model of delegation machine learning by delegation computation thought. Finally, we design a rational delegation learning scheme (RDLS) for decision tree model. The feasibility and reliability of the scheme are guaranteed by the incentive and constraint mechanism of game model. Moreover, we analyze the security and performance of the proposed scheme, the results show that the scheme reduces the client's computing costs and can not disclose any useful information. Last but not least, the experimental result demonstrates that the scheme can obtain a decision tree model with high accuracy in the case of ensuring the security of data.

This tradeoff is known as the explore-exploit dilemma. To better understand the neural mechanisms underlying how humans and animals address the explore-exploit dilemma, a good animal behavioral model is critical. Most previous rodents explore-exploit studies used ethologically unrealistic operant boxes and reversal learning paradigms in which the decision to abandon a bad option is confounded by the need for exploring a novel option for information collection, making it difficult to separate different drives and heuristics for exploration. In this study, we investigated how rodents make explore-exploit decisions using a spatial navigation horizon task (Wilson et al., 2014) adapted to rats to address the above limitations. We compared the rats' performance to that of humans using identical measures. We showed that rats use prior information to effectively guide exploration. In addition, rats use information-driven directed exploration like humans, but the extent to which they explore has the opposite dependance on time horizon than humans. Moreover, we found that free choices and guided choices have different influences on exploration in rodents, a finding that has not yet been tested in humans. This study reveals that the explore-exploit spatial behavior of rats is more complex than previously thought.

Energy Analysis of Hardware and Software Range Partitioning	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS			English	Article						Design; Measurement; Performance; Accelerator; specialized functional unit; streaming data; microarchitecture; data partitioning	MEMORY	Data partitioning is a critical operation for manipulating large datasets because it subdivides tasks into pieces that are more amenable to efficient processing. It is often the limiting factor in database performance and represents a significant fraction of the overall runtime of large data queries. This article measures the performance and energy of state-of-the-art software partitioners, and describes and evaluates a hardware range partitioner that further improves efficiency. The software implementation is broken into two phases, allowing separate analysis of the partition function computation and data shuffling costs. Although range partitioning is commonly thought to be more expensive than simpler strategies such as hash partitioning, our measurements indicate that careful data movement and optimization of the partition function can allow it to approach the throughput and energy consumption of hash or radix partitioning. For further acceleration, we describe a hardware range partitioner, or HARP, a streaming framework that offers a seamless execution environment for this and other streaming accelerators, and a detailed analysis of a 32nm physical design that matches the throughput of four to eight software threads while consuming just 6.9% of the area and 4.3% of the power of a Xeon core in the same technology generation.

Another line of research suggests that people make less biased decisions (e.g., are less affected by the framing of a gamble) when using a foreign language. In the current study, we investigated whether using a foreign language (as opposed to one's native language) reduced the biasing effects of unclaimed prize information and consequently led to more optimal scratch card preferences. Across three experiments (N = 409), we found that people were equally biased by unclaimed prize information regardless of whether they completed our scratch card gambling task in their native (Polish) or foreign (English) language. In conclusion, it appears that using a foreign language does not help people be less biased in utilizing gambling-related information, and consequently does not lead to more optimal scratch card preferences.

In addition, the authors examine municipal webpage rankings in search engines and the factors explaining them. Design/methodology/approach The empirical study, conducted through a sample of Spanish city councils, contrasted if the information that can be found on a municipal website fits with citizens' demands. This has been done by comparing the most-searched keywords with the contents of municipal websites. Findings A positive relationship between the supply and demand of municipal information on the internet has been found, but much can still be improved. Analysed administrations rank the basic data of the organisation, as well as some of the fundamental competences thereof, at the top in search engines, but the results are not entirely effective with some keywords still highly demanded by citizens, such as those related to employment or tourism. Factors explaining internet ranking include the number of pages of the municipal website, its presence in social networks and an indicator designed to measure the difficulty of ranking the municipal place-name. Originality/value The results obtained from this study provide valuable information for municipal managers. Municipal websites should not only include information in which citizens are interested, but achieve accessibility standards, have a responsive web design, and follow the rules of web usability. Additionally, they should be findable, which also requires improvement in terms of the design of the municipal website thinking in search engines, particularly in terms of certain technical characteristics that improve findability. A municipal website that wants to have a good positioning should increase its contents and attain the maximum degree possible of visibility in social networks.

This review examines the health effects of household water quantity using studies that directly measured water quantity. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and article reference lists. Eligible studies included experimental and observational studies that measured a difference in water quantity and quantified an association between water quantity and health outcomes. 21 studies, divided into six of the many possible water-quantity associated outcomes, met the eligibility criteria. Due to heterogeneity in designs, settings, methods, and outcomes, a meta-analysis was inappropriate. Overall results showed a positive association between water quantity and health outcomes, but the effect depended on how the water was used. Increased water usage for personal hygiene was generally associated with improved trachoma outcomes, while increased water consumption was generally associated with reduced gastrointestinal infection and diarrheal disease and improved growth outcomes. In high-income countries, increased water consumption was associated with higher rates of renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer but not associated with type II diabetes, cardiac-related mortality, or all-cause mortality.

Classifying emerging knowledge sharing practices and some insights into antecedents to social networking: a case in insurance	JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Knowledge sharing; Insurance supply chain; Social networking tools; Supply chain dominance and influence	ONLINE; INFORMATION; DETERMINANTS; COMMUNITIES; ACCEPTANCE; INTENTION; MEDIA; USAGE; MODEL	Purpose - The paper aims to explore a case of early adoption of the use of social media tools for the purposes of knowledge and information sharing across a supply chain in the UK home insurance market. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology used includes genre and content analysis to analyze empirical data from blogs and posts via a customized social extranet [Engaging in Knowledge Networking via an interactive 3D Social Supplier Network (KNOWLEDGE NETWORK)] involving 130 users over a 13-month period. Findings - The results uncover a set of emerging practices which support both information and knowledge exchange, but which are mainly driven by organizational factors such as buyer power and supplier competitive influencing. Research limitations/implications - This study has contributed an overall conceptual understanding of reasons behind social media adoption by identifying organizational attributes of buyer power and supplier influence as key antecedents to knowledge sharing within a supply chain. Originality/value - This paper builds on current thinking in social media theory by providing a window into organizational and supply chain attributes that can explain social media adoption within the context of knowledge sharing supply chains. A systematic classification of user posts over an extended period enabled this work to illuminate not only emerging knowledge sharing practices across a buyer-led supply chain but also the effects of buyer power on users in an online community.

To achieve a fair comparison between the different types of groups, we developed an ad-hoc arithmetic library, designed to remove most of the overheads that penalize implementations of curve-based cryptography over prime fields. These overheads get worse for smaller fields, and thus for larger genera for a fixed group size. We also use techniques for delaying modular reductions to reduce the amount of modular reductions in the formulae for the group operations. The result is that the performance of hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 over prime fields is much closer to the performance of elliptic curves than previously thought. For groups of 192 and 256 bits the difference is about 14% and 15% respectively.

J	Dündar-Coecke, S; Tolmie, A; Schlottmann, A				Dundar-Coecke, Selma; Tolmie, Andrew; Schlottmann, Anne			The role of spatial and spatial-temporal analysis in children's causal cognition of continuous processes	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MENTAL ROTATION; PERCEPTUAL CAUSALITY; PERSPECTIVE-TAKING; DUAL-TASK; INFORMATION; CONTIGUITY; SKILLS; TIME	Past research has largely ignored children's ability to conjointly manipulate spatial and temporal information, but there are indications that the capacity to do so may provide important support for reasoning about causal processes. We hypothesised that spatial-temporal thinking is central to children's ability to identify the invisible mechanisms that tie cause and effect together in continuous casual processes, which are focal in primary school science and crucial to understanding of the natural world. We investigated this in two studies (N = 107, N = 124), employing two methodologies, one shorter, the other more in depth. Further tasks assessed spatial-temporal (flow of liquid, extrapolation of relative speed, distance-time-velocity), spatial (two mental rotation, paper folding), verbal (expressive vocabulary), and nonverbal (block design) ability. Age dependent patterns were detected for both causal and predictor tasks. Two spatial-temporal tasks were unique and central predictors of children's causal reasoning, especially inference of mechanism. Nonverbal ability predicted the simpler components of causal reasoning. One mental rotation task predicted only young children's causal thinking. Verbal ability became significant when the sample included children from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds. Causal reasoning about continuous processes, including inferences of causal mechanism, appears to be within the reach of children from school entry age, but mechanism inference is uncommon. Analytic forms of spatial-temporal capacity seem to be important requirements for children to progress to this rather than merely perceptual forms.

Feasibility of a RCT of techniques for managing an impacted fetal head during emergency caesarean section: the MIDAS scoping study	HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT			English	Article							FULL CERVICAL DILATATION; DELIVERY	Background: Second-stage caesarean sections, of which there are around 34,000 per year in the United Kingdom, have greater maternal and perinatal morbidity than those in the first stage. The fetal head is often deeply impacted in the maternal pelvis, and extraction can be difficult. Numerous techniques are reported, but the superiority of one over another is contentious and there is no national guidance.Objective: To determine the feasibility of a randomised trial of different techniques for managing an impacted fetal head during emergency caesarean.Design: A scoping study with five work packages: (1) national surveys to determine current practice and acceptability of research in this area, and a qualitative study to determine acceptability to women who have experienced a second-stage caesarean; (2) a national prospective observational study to determine incidence and rate of complications; (3) a Delphi survey and consensus meeting on choice of techniques and outcomes for a trial; (4) the design of a trial; and (5) a national survey and qualitative study to determine acceptability of the proposed trial.Setting: Secondary care.Participants: Health-care professionals, pregnant women, women who have had a second-stage caesarean, and parents.Results: Most (244/279, 87%) health-care professionals believe that a trial in this area would help guide their practice, and 90% (252/279) would be willing to participate in such a trial. Thirty-eight per cent (98/259) of parents reported that they would take part. Women varied in which technique they thought was most acceptable. Our observational study found that impacted head is common (occurring in 16% of second-stage caesareans) and leads to both maternal (41%) and neonatal (3.5%) complications. It is most often treated by an assistant pushing the head up vaginally. We designed a randomised clinical trial comparing the fetal pillow with the vaginal push technique. The vast majority of health-care professionals, 83% of midwives and 88% of obstetricians, would be willing to participate in the trial proposed, and 37% of parents reported that they would take part. Our qualitative study found that most participants thought the trial would be feasible and acceptable.Limitations: Our survey is subject to the limitation that, although responses refer to contemporaneous real cases, they are self-reported by the surgeon and collected after the event. Willingness to participate in a hypothetical trial may not translate into recruitment to a real trial.Conclusions: We proposed a trial to compare a new device, the fetal pillow, with a long-established procedure, the vaginal push technique. Such a trial would be widely supported by health-care professionals. We recommend that it be powered to test an effect on important short term maternal and baby outcomes which would require 754 participants per group. Despite the well-known difference between intent and action, this would be feasible within the United Kingdom.Future work: We recommend a randomised controlled trial of two techniques for managing an impacted fetal head with an in-built internal pilot phase and alongside economic and qualitative substudies.Study registration: This study is registered as Research Registry 4942.

What can violations of good practices tell about the relationship between GoF patterns and run-time quality attributes?	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Software architecture; GoF patterns; Design; Quality analysis; Evaluation	OF-THE-ART; DESIGN PATTERNS; STATIC ANALYSIS; ROLES	Context: GoF patterns have been extensively studied with respect to the benefit they provide as problem-solving, communication and quality improvement mechanisms. The latter has been mostly investigated through empirical studies, but some aspects of quality (esp. run-time ones) are still under-investigated. Objective: In this paper, we study if the presence of patterns enforces the conformance to good coding practices. To achieve this goal, we explore the relationship between the presence of GoF design patterns and violations of good practices related to source code correctness, performance and security, via static analysis. Method: Specifically, we exploit static analysis so as to investigate whether the number of violations of good coding practices identified on classes is related to: (a) their participation in pattern occurrences, (b) the pattern category, (c) the pattern in which they participate, and (d) their role within the pattern occurrence. To answer these questions, we performed a case study on approximately 13,000 classes retrieved from five open-source projects. Results: The obtained results suggest that classes not participating in patterns are more probable to violate good coding practices for correctness, performance and security. In a more fine-grained level of analysis, by focusing on specific patterns, we observed that patterns with more complex structure (e.g., Decorator) and pattern roles that are more change-prone (e.g., Subclasses) are more likely to be associated with a higher number of violations (up to 50 times more violations). Conclusion: This finding implies that investing in a well-thought architecture based on best practices, such as patterns, is often accompanied with cleaner code with fewer violations.

We designed this study to define the transcriptome of HGMEC and facilitate a better characterization of these endothelial cells with unique features. Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) was used for its unbiased approach to quantitative acquisition of transcripts. Results: We generated a HGMEC SAGE library consisting of 68,987 transcript tags. Then taking advantage of large public databases and advanced bioinformatics we compared the HGMEC SAGE library with a SAGE library of non-cultured ex vivo human glomeruli (44,334 tags) which contained endothelial cells. The 823 tags common to both which would have the potential to be expressed in vivo were subsequently checked against 822,008 tags from 16 non-glomerular endothelial SAGE libraries. This resulted in 268 transcript tags differentially overexpressed in HGMEC compared to non-glomerular endothelia. These tags were filtered using a set of criteria: never before shown in kidney or any type of endothelial cell, absent in all nephron regions except the glomerulus, more highly expressed than statistically expected in HGMEC. Neurogranin, a direct target of thyroid hormone action which had been thought to be brain specific and never shown in endothelial cells before, fulfilled these criteria. Its expression in glomerular endothelium in vitro and in vivo was then verified by real-time-PCR, sequencing and immunohistochemistry. Conclusions: Our results represent an extensive molecular characterization of HGMEC beyond a mere database, underline the endothelial heterogeneity, and propose neurogranin as a potential link in the kidney-thyroid axis.

Reasoning judgments have been shown to be influenced by prior knowledge, beliefs, and experience-that is, information stored in semantic memory. It was hypothesized that high schizotypes would exhibit a "jump to conclusions" style of reasoning as a result of not using implicit information concerned with cause-effect relationships. Research into human reasoning has traditionally adopted logic as a normative framework to assess human reasoning. Conditional inference tasks are direct tests of logical performance, and we employed an established design that depends upon the reasoner's ability to access and use implicit information. In an effort to negate some of the difficulties of research with schizophrenia patients, schizotypy measures were employed in a normal population. The results confirmed that high scorers on one dimension of schizotypy (Impulsive Nonconformity) failed to take account of the number of counterexamples that characterized the cause-effect conditional statement. These observations supported previous research demonstrating a jump to conclusions style of reasoning that it has been suggested plays a role in the formation and maintenance of delusions. Furthermore, these findings suggest a possible link between semantic memory and reasoning biases.

To this end, the case study design, one of the qualitative research methods was used in the study. The participants of the study are social studies teachers selected by using the criterion sampling method and participating in the project on a volunteer basis. The data of the study were collected through the pre-interview and post-interview forms qualitatively developed by the researchers and participant diaries. Moreover, in order to elicit more detailed information about environmental awareness and sensitivity, two quantitative scales were used as pre- and post-tests to measure the participants' motivation for taking part in activities and basic views of environment and environmental problems. As a result of the applied education program, the participants' motivation to take part in activities to be conducted in natural environment and their ecocentric mindset was strengthened. In addition, the participants think that at the end of the program, they better understood human-environment interaction and developed their awareness of sustainable environment. In addition, the participants stated that they received the information from its source and in an interdisciplinary manner, developed different perspectives, and developed scientific, social and entrepreneurial skills. Finally, it was determined that the participants thought that they gained experience and motivation in order to use the knowledge and skills they had gained through the activities within the context of the program in formal and informal educational settings.

SUSTAIN Consortium	Improving Person-Centredness in Integrated Care for Older People: Experiences from Thirteen Integrated Care Sites in Europe	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED CARE			English	Article						older people; integrated care; person-centredness; mixed methods; implementation science; European research	MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS; SHARED DECISION-MAKING; PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS; HEALTH-CARE; COMPREHENSIVE CARE; ADULTS; PROGRAMS; PARTICIPATION; INVOLVEMENT; INVENTORY	Introduction: Although person-centredness is a key principle of integrated care, successfully embedding and improving person-centred care for older people remains a challenge. In the context of a crossEuropean project on integrated care for older people living at home, the objective of this paper is to provide insight at an overarching level, into activities aimed at improving person-centredness within the participating integrated care sites. The paper describes experiences with these activities from the service providers' and service users' perspectives. Methods: A multiple embedded case study design was conducted that included thirteen integrated care sites for older people living at home. Results: Service providers were positive about the activities that aimed to promote person-centred care and thought that most activities (e.g. comprehensive needs assessment) positively influenced personcentredness. Experiences of service users were mixed. For some activities (e.g. enablement services), discrepancies were identified between the views of service providers and those of service users. Discussion and conclusion: Evaluating activities aimed at promoting person-centredness from both the service providers' and service users' perspectives showed that not all efforts were successful or had the intended consequences for older people. Involvement of older people in designing improvement activities could ensure that care and support reflect their needs and preferences, and build positive experiences of care and support.

J	Bender, J				Bender, J			The use of noncancer endpoints as a basis for establishing a reference concentration for formaldehyde	REGULATORY TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						formaldehyde; noncancer; reference concentration; sensory irritation; nasal mucosa; Integrated Risk Information System; IRIS	ACUTE PULMONARY RESPONSE; 2.0 PPM FORMALDEHYDE; NASAL-MUCOSA; OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; IRRITATION RESPONSE; HEALTHY NONSMOKERS; ASTHMATICS; LAVAGE; COUNT	Published studies involving formaldehyde were selected for quality and relevance for determining whether noncancer endpoints could be used to derive a reference concentration for formaldehyde. Chamber studies provided the highest quality data for determining the presence of eye, nose, or throat irritation at a known level of formaldehyde. Some individuals begin to sense irritation at about 0.5 ppm, 5-20% report eye irritation at 0.5 to 1 ppm, and greater certainty for sensory irritation appears at I ppm or greater. These levels of formaldehyde do not appear to impact asthmatics even though these individuals are thought to be more sensitive to irritants. Mild, reversible changes in pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume at 1 s and midexpiratory flow) can occur in sensitized individuals at levels approaching 2 ppm. Studies in the manufacturing setting, while confounded by multiple exposures, provide useful information for setting boundaries for sensory irritation or changes in pulmonary function. Community surveys do not provide the specificity nor sensitivity needed to establish a reference concentration. Histological studies of the nasal mucosa suffer significant methodological and technological shortcomings in addition to issues commonly associated with the design of residential and workplace studies. Based on the review of chamber, community, and workplace studies of human exposures to formaldehyde, it is not possible to identify a specific no observed adverse effect level or lowest observed adverse effect level for formaldehyde. Ranges of exposures associated with acute sensory irritation can be derived and do include sensitive subpopulations. However, given the quality and variability of the data, human studies alone, especially those involving sensory irritation, are not adequate to serve as a reference concentration for estimating risk, or lack thereof, for a lifetime of exposure to formaldehyde. Alternative approaches, such as modeling cellular changes observed in animal studies, may be more useful for quantitative risk assessment of noncancer endpoints and should be used as an adjunct to interpreting human sensory studies.

It has previously demonstrated strong concurrent validity with the Short-Form 36 health questionnaire and excellent test-retest reliability. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate its appropriateness, validity, acceptability, feasibility and interpretability. Design: A qualitative evaluation using semi-structured telephone interviews, incorporating a 'think aloud' exercise and additional prompts. Method: Adults with JHS (n = 11) were recruited through a patient organisation and physiotherapists with a professional interest in JHS (n = 9) were recruited through the same organisation and an online professional network. Interviews were transcribed and data synthesised using a framework matrix. Findings: Patients and physiotherapists commented positively on the appropriateness, validity, acceptability and feasibility of the BIoH questionnaire. Physiotherapists assessed the interpretability of the questionnaire and commented that, whilst further information might be captured, the value of that information might be limited. The questionnaire was considered comprehensive with only a very limited number of potential missing areas related to use of hand-held technology, hair washing/drying and intimacy. Interestingly, keyboard use and hair washing were excluded during initial questionnaire development as they were rated as relatively unimportant. Intimacy was not considered a comfortable addition for all participants. Conclusions: Patients and physiotherapists regarded the BIoH questionnaire as a welcome addition to the toolkit available to assess those with JHS. It was broadly accepted as reflecting the experience of people with JHS in sufficient detail to support management.

Acetate metabolism does not reflect astrocytic activity, contributes directly to GABA synthesis, and is increased by silent information regulator 1 activation	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						acetate metabolism; Acetylation; compartmentation; GABA synthesis	BRAIN IN-VIVO; TRICARBOXYLIC-ACID CYCLE; VERY-LOW CONCENTRATIONS; RAT-BRAIN; GLIAL METABOLISM; OXIDATIVE-METABOLISM; CEREBRAL METABOLISM; ACETYL-COA; C-13 NMR; EXTRACELLULAR POTASSIUM	[C-13]Acetate is known to label metabolites preferentially in astrocytes rather than neurons and it has consequently been used as a marker for astrocytic activity. Recent discoveries suggest that control of acetate metabolism and its contributions to the synthesis of metabolites in brain is not as simple as first thought. Here, using a Guinea pig brain cortical tissue slice model metabolizing [1-C-13]-glucose and [1,2-C-13]acetate, we investigated control of acetate metabolism and the degree to which it reflects astrocytic activity. Using a range of [1,2-C-13]acetate concentrations, we found that acetate is a poor substrate for metabolism and will inhibit metabolism of itself and of glucose at concentrations in excess of 2 mmol/L. By activating astrocytes using potassium depolarization, we found that use of [1,2-C-13]acetate to synthesize glutamine decreases significantly under these conditions showing that acetate metabolism does not necessarily reflect astrocytic activity. By blocking synthesis of glutamine using methionine sulfoximine, we found that significant amount of [1,2-C-13] acetate are still incorporated into GABA and its metabolic precursors in neurons, with around 30% of the GABA synthesized from [1,2-C-13]acetate likely to be made directly in neurons rather than from glutamine supplied by astrocytes. Finally, to test whether activity of the acetate metabolizing enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase is under acetylation control in the brain, we incubated slices with the AceCS1 deacetylase silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) activator SRT 1720 and showed consequential increased incorporation of [1,2-C-13] acetate into metabolites, Taken together, these data show that acetate metabolism is not directly nor exclusively related to astrocytic metabolic activity, that use of acetate is related to enzyme acetylation and that acetate is directly metabolized to a significant degree in GABAergic neurons. Changes in acetate metabolism should be interpreted as modulation of metabolism through changes in cellular energetic status via altered enzyme acetylation levels rather than simply as an adjustment of glial neuronal metabolic activity.

J	Sampaio, S; Wu, Q; Cormican, K; Varajao, J				Sampaio, Suzana; Wu, Qiong; Cormican, Kathryn; Varajao, Joao			Reach for the sky: analysis of behavioral competencies linked to project success	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGING PROJECTS IN BUSINESS			English	Article						Project manager; Project success; Competency; Information systems	MANAGEMENT KNOWLEDGE; CONSTRUCTION; LEADERSHIP; ORGANIZATIONS; PERSPECTIVE; SKILLS	Purpose The issue of project managers' competencies has gained much traction in practice and more recently in academic debate. However, they have become analogous to extensive wish lists where a project manager is expected to have an exhaustive list of aptitudes and capabilities. Therefore, identifying and defining the most critical competencies for project success is urgently needed. Moreover, although the vast number of studies emphasize the significance of behavioral competencies, there is a dearth of empirical research and studies within the context of information systems (IS) are scarce. Consequently, the present study aims to investigate the influence of project manager's behavioral competencies for the successful delivery of IS projects. Design/methodology/approach This research conducted a systematic literature review (2009-2019) of 27 relevant studies incorporating 179 competencies. The authors also collected data from 121 professional IS project managers and used regression analysis and dominance analysis to test the hypotheses proposed. Findings The results confirm that behavioral competencies (including leadership, communication, result orientation, emotional intelligence, ethics, creativity and motivation) are significantly and positively related to IS project success. Furthermore, the findings show that emotional intelligence (resilience, stress management and self-control), creativity (resourcefulness, creativity thinking and imagination) and ethics (transparency, honesty and integrity) are the most influential behavioral competencies for IS project success. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this research is among the first to use a quantitative analysis to empirically investigate project manager's behavioral competencies for project success in the IS discipline. It brings much-needed empirical evidence for the most important competencies for IS project managers.

J	Kuczenski, B; Davis, CB; Rivela, B; Janowicz, K				Kuczenski, Brandon; Davis, Christopher B.; Rivela, Beatriz; Janowicz, Krzysztof			Semantic catalogs for life cycle assessment data	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Life cycle assessment; Interoperability; Semantic web; Ontology design patterns; Data management; Linked data	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT; ONTOLOGIES; FRAMEWORK	Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a highly interdisciplinary field that requires knowledge from different domains to be gathered and interpreted together. Although there are relatively few major data sources for LCA, the data themselves are presented with highly heterogeneous formats, interfaces, and distribution mechanisms. The lack of agreement among data providers for descriptions of processes and flows creates substantial barriers for information sharing and reuse of practitioners' models. Nevertheless, the many data resources share a common logic. The use of Semantic Web technologies and text mining techniques can facilitate the interpretation of data from diverse sources. Numerous existing efforts have been made to articulate a knowledge model for LCA. In March of 2015 a joint workshop was held that brought together leading international domain experts with ontology engineers to develop a set of simple models called ontology design patterns (ODPs) for LCA information. In this paper we build on the outcomes of the workshop, as well as prior published works, to derive a minimal "consensus model" for LCA. We use the consensus model to derive a description of an LCA "catalog" that can be used to express the semantic content of a data resource. We generate catalogs of several prominent databases, and make those catalogs available to the public for independent use. Finally, we "link" those catalogs to existing knowledge models using JSON-LD, a linked data format that can expose the catalog contents to Semantic Web tools. We then show by example how the catalogs may be used to answer questions about the scope, coverage, and comparability of data, both within and across data sources, that are difficult to answer when the contents of the catalogs are provided independently and inconsistently. We discuss how the use of semantic catalogs can help address challenges that initiatives such as the "Global Network of Interoperable LCA Databases Global LCA Data Access" are facing today.

Teaching critical appraisal and statistics in anesthesia journal club	QJM-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							EDUCATION; KNOWLEDGE; MEDICINE; TRIAL	Background: This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of a series of journal clubs held for anesthesiology residents in promoting their awareness of research methods and statistical analysis, as well as their skills in critical thinking and appraisal. Material and methods: Twenty-four journal club sessions were held between September 2006 and August 2007 for 16 residents of anesthesiology. A 31 multiple-choice question (MCQ) was taken as pretest and posttest to evaluate the participants level of awareness in research methodology and statistical analysis. Their competence in critical thinking and appraisal was also evaluated by evaluating a randomized controlled trial paper using the CONSORT checklist before and after the course. Results: Residents awareness in the application of information improved (P 0.012), as well as research methodology (combined study design and application of information, P 0.017). Their ability in critical appraisal did also significantly rise at the end of the course (P 0.001). Conclusion: Journal clubs can enable residents to develop the knowledge, expertise and enthusiasm needed to undertake research plans and can also enhance their ability in critical thinking and scientific reading.

J	Wu, XN; Zhang, Q				Wu, Xinning; Zhang, Qian			Remote Human-Computer Interaction and STEM Teacher Online Training Based on Embedded Internet of Things	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								In order to expand the concept and form of teacher training, a remote human-computer interaction and STEM teacher online training platform based on the embedded Internet of Things is proposed. Based on the content analysis method, this article sorts out the development status of the current online teacher training platform and points out the shortcomings of the platform in information aggregation, resource construction, content setting, presentation, learning support services, and other aspects. Based on the combination of new concepts and new technologies, an online training platform for STEM teachers is proposed for the construction of the platform from four perspectives: innovative design concepts, enriching platform promotion ideas, developing educational makers, and improving support services, and the results of the use are investigated. The results show that the subjects believe that the STEM teacher online training system has clarified the STEM curriculum design steps, standardized STEM design methods, improved their cooperative learning ability, and cultivated design thinking. Among them, 13 people think that the training system has made STEM design steps clearer, "the design process is clearer," "it makes me clearer about the whole design process," and "the course design and development process is clearer." Conclusion. This platform can provide a reference for online training and professional development of Chinese teachers.

Collectivistic health promotion tools: Accounting for the relationship between culture, food and nutrition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article						Community computing; Collectivism; Culture; Health; Nutrition	ONLINE SUPPORT GROUPS; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; VERTICAL INDIVIDUALISM; SOCIAL SUPPORT; EMPOWERING PROCESSES; PEOPLE; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; ATTITUDES; OUTCOMES	Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers are increasingly examining how Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can help people eat more healthfully. However, within HCI, there has been little examination of the way that cultural values influence how people think about food and wellness, and how sociocultural context supports or impedes attempts to eat healthfully. Our work focuses on the diet-related health challenges of African Americans within low-income neighborhoods. This population disproportionately experiences diet-related disease, and as such, researchers have consistently advocated research that examines the way in which food practices are culturally situated. Through formative focus groups with 46 participants we identified several design implications for tools that promote healthy eating while accounting for collectivism, a cultural value often ascribed to the African American population. Based on our design implications we developed, deployed and evaluated two systems that supported the sharing of community-held knowledge about making healthy eating decisions. In our discussion, we present implications for the design of collectivistic systems that address food practices. We conclude with recommendations for HCI research that investigates the relationship between culture and food more broadly. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A review was undertaken of the published literature about mumps or mumps vaccine and diabetes mellitus in childhood. There has been considerable speculation about the role of wild mumps virus and mumps vaccine in the onset of childhood diabetes. Available data about this is incomplete and difficult to interpret partly as several factors are thought to be involved in the development of childhood diabetes. Well-designed and long-term studies about the use of mumps vaccine and incidence of childhood diabetes could be done. The general approach used in this paper could be applied to study the health effects of other vaccines. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

They both need to question common thinking and evaluate whether reality is not as we always thought. Based on this, we need to design hypotheses, experiments, and analyses to prove our alternative vision. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly moving from an "assistant" into a proper "colleague" for literature mining, data analysis and interpretation, and literally having (almost) real scientific conversations. However, being AI based on existing information, if we rely on it excessively will we still be able to question the status quo? In this article, we are particularly interested in discussing the future of proteomics and mass spectrometry with our new electronic collaborator. We leave to the reader the judgement whether the answers we received are satisfactory or superficial. What we were mostly interested in was laying down what we think are critical questions that the proteomics community should occasionally ask to itself. Proteomics has been around for more than 30 years, but it is still missing a few critical steps to fully address its promises as being the new genomics for clinical diagnostics and fundamental science, while becoming a user-friendly tool for every lab. Will we get there with the help of AI? And will these answers change in a short period, as AI continues to advance?

J	Çetinkaya, Ç				Cetinkaya, Caglar			The Effect of Differentiated Social Studies Curriculum on Secondary School Gifted Students' Verbal Creativity in Istanbul	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						giftedness; gifted children; curriculum differentiation in social studies; curriculum differentiation; social studies; verbal creativity	TORRANCE TESTS; THINKING	The principal aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a differentiated social studies course curriculum on gifted students' verbal creativity. This study is important in terms of developing verbal creativity in gifted students through the social sciences curriculum. It is important in terms of being the first study to develop verbal creativity through a differentiation study in the field of social studies for gifted students. Differentiation in social studies was carried out by considering the Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM). For this, the study was conducted using a quasi-experimental design with pretest-post-test experimental and control groups. The sample consisted of 24 gifted students, 12 in the experimental group and 12 in the control group, selected from secondary schools in Istanbul. While the experimental group received this curriculum-oriented training to develop their verbal creativity skills, the control group received a standard social studies curriculum. In the study, the verbal creativity skills of gifted students were tested using the "Torrance Test of Creative Thinking-Verbal" (TTCT-V) before and after the interventions. In addition, a demographic information form was used to describe the demographic characteristics of the participants. Then, the data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. The findings showed that differentiated activities and instructions showed a significant positive effect on the gifted students' verbal creativity skills. Therefore, it was concluded that the differentiated social studies curriculum developed for gifted students contributed to students' verbal creativity skills.

J	Dali, K; Vannier, C; Douglass, L				Dali, Keren; Vannier, Clarissa; Douglass, Lindsay			Reading experience librarianship: working with readers in the 21st century	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Community engagement; Readers' advisory; Reading experience librarianship; Outreach; Whole person librarianship		Purpose Addressed to the audience of LIS educators at all levels, from full-time and adjunct faculty teaching in LIS programs, to librarians and library consultants delivering professional development training, to practitioners who work with readers in all types of libraries, this article makes a case for replacing the term "readers' advisory" with the term "Reading Experience (RE) librarianship" as a designator of the current professional practice. Design/methodology/approach Using historical and discursive analysis based on the extensive literature review, this article argues that a number of factors call for the change in terminology: changes in the human factor (i.e., changes in readers and reading behavior; and changes in relationships between readers and librarians) and changes in the library environment (the rise of "experience" in libraries; a greater commitment to outreach and community engagement; and the fact that librarians are already practicing RE librarianship without recognizing it as such). It also examines the role of LIS educators in fostering and supporting RE librarianship. Findings On the one hand, the new terminology will be more reflective of the work that reader service librarians currently do, thus doing justice to a wide range of activities and expanded roles of librarians; on the other hand, it will serve as an imperative and a motivator to further transform reader services from in-house interactions with and programs for avid readers into a true community engagement, with much broader goals, scope and reach. Originality/value The article stands to coin a new professional term for the transformed library practice, thus recording a radical change in longstanding professional activities and encouraging new community-oriented thinking about the expanded role of librarians in promoting reading in diverse social environments.

Here we present a review of Iterative Peptide In Situ Click Chemistry (IPISC), a novel screening technology for designing peptide multiligands with high affinity and specificity. This technology builds upon in situ click chemistry, a kinetic target-guided synthesis approach where the protein target catalyzes the conjugation of two small molecules, typically through the azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition. Integrating this methodology with solid phase peptide libraries enables the assembly of linear and branched peptide multiligands we refer to as Protein Catalyzed Capture Agents (PCC Agents). The resulting structures can be thought of as analogous to the antigen recognition site of antibodies and serve as antibody replacements in biochemical and cell-based applications. In this review, we discuss the recent progress in ligand design through IPISC and related approaches, focusing on the improvements in affinity and specificity as multiligands are assembled by target-catalyzed peptide conjugation. We compare the IPISC process to small molecule in situ click chemistry with particular emphasis on the advantages and technical challenges of constructing antibody-like PCC Agents.

J	Park, M; Gu, M; Sok, S				Park, Minsook; Gu, Minkyung; Sok, Sohyune			Path model on decision-making ability of clinical nurses	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						decision-making ability; nurse; path analysis	CRITICAL THINKING ABILITY; KOREAN VERSION; SATISFACTION; RELIABILITY; INTUITION; VALIDITY; SUPPORT; IMPACT	Aims and objectives To identify and examine the relationship between the factors influencing the decision-making ability of clinical nurses in hospitals, South Korea, and to establish a model, to verify the fit and the effect. Background Clinical nurses are exposed to environments and situations where they make continuous decisions according to the need of direct treatment and nursing. Design This study used a cross-sectional descriptive design, relation prediction modelling and adheres to the STROBE guidelines. Methods The model construction was based on the information processing theory by Hansen and Thomas (Nursing Research, 17, 436, 1968). The model consists of 5 exogenous variables (expertise, critical thinking disposition, knowledge-sharing behaviour, nursing work environment, and decision-making stress) and 3 endogenous variables (analytic-systematic decision-making type, intuitive-interpretive decision-making type and decision-making ability). Participants were 274 clinical nurses, who were working at two hospitals in Seoul, South Korea. The data was analysed using SPSS WIN 18.0 and AMOS 20.0 program. Path analysis to verify the hypothetical model was used, and the fit was evaluated by chi(2)/df, GFI, AGFI, NFI, CFI and RMSEA. Data were collected from March to May 2017. Results The fit index of the modified path model was chi(2)/df = 2.25, GFI = .972, AGFI = .929, NFI = .967, CFI = .981 and RMSEA = .068. The analytic-systematic decision-making type had the greatest direct effect on the clinical nurses' decision-making ability, which is the final outcome variable, followed by significant direct and indirect effects on critical thinking disposition. Conclusion This study suggests that the clinical nurses' decision-making ability in hospitals were leadingly influenced by analytic-systematic decision-making type and critical thinking disposition. Relevance to clinical practice In the nursing practice, nurses need to pay attention the analytic-systematic decision-making type and critical thinking disposition for improving decision-making ability of clinical nurses in hospitals.

J	Thompson, AR; Giffin, BF				Thompson, Andrew R.; Giffin, Bruce F.			Higher-Order Assessment in Gross Anatomy: A Comparison of Performance on Higher- Versus Lower-Order Anatomy Questions between Undergraduate and First-Year Medical Students	ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION			English	Article						gross anatomy education; medical education; undergraduate education; evaluation; Bloom&apos; s taxonomy; psychometric data; blueprinting	BLOOMS TAXONOMY; TEST EXPECTANCY; SKILLS; EXAMS; COURSEWORK; KNOWLEDGE; HISTOLOGY; THINKING	Gross anatomy is considered by many the backbone of medical education. While learning anatomy has a reputation of requiring mainly rote memorization, modern day anatomy education often involves instruction and assessment at cognitive levels that foster higher-order thinking. In many instances, these higher-order anatomical concepts are taught to graduate students in healthcare-related fields, such as medicine. At this level, students are expected to apply and analyze anatomical information since that is what will ultimately be expected of them as professionals. In contrast, undergraduate anatomy education is typically more introductory in nature and often takes place in the setting of a large-enrollment course that serves as a prerequisite for many health sciences degree programs. In this study, variables related to the assessment of higher-order concepts in clinical anatomy were compared between first-year medical students and undergraduate students enrolled in an upper-level human gross anatomy course. Results demonstrate that undergraduate students perform lower than medical students overall, but the degree of difference in how they perform on higher- versus lower-order questions is comparable. The most notable exception is on practical examinations, where undergraduate students tend to struggle more with applying and analyzing information. Exploration of additional variables provides insight into how the cognitive level being assessed affects the time it takes to answer a question and how different practical examination question types and formats influence student performance. Findings presented in this study have implications for designing anatomy courses and underscore the importance of blueprinting assessments.

The retrieved results are expected to conform to both explicit visual attributes (e.g., chart type, colormap) and implicit user intents (e.g., design style, context information) that vary upon application scenarios. However, existing example-based chart retrieval methods are built upon non-decoupled and low-level visual features that are hard to interpret, while definition-based ones are constrained to pre-defined attributes that are hard to extend. In this work, we propose a new framework, namely WYTIWYR (What-You-Think-Is-What-You-Retrieve), that integrates user intents into the chart retrieval process. The framework consists of two stages: first, the Annotation stage disentangles the visual attributes within the query chart; and second, the Retrieval stage embeds the user's intent with customized text prompt as well as bitmap query chart, to recall targeted retrieval result. We develop aprototype WYTIWYR system leveraging a contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model to achieve zero-shot classification as well as multi-modal input encoding, and test the prototype on a large corpus with charts crawled from the Internet. Quantitative experiments, case studies, and qualitative interviews are conducted. The results demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Hemanth			Artificial Intelligence in Pharmaceutical Field-A Critical Review	CURRENT DRUG DELIVERY			English	Review						Artificial intelligence; pharmaceutical sciences; drug development; data management; machine learning; comput-er-aided system	NEURAL-NETWORKS; IN-SILICO; PREDICTION; DESIGN	Artificial intelligence is an emerging sector in almost all fields. It is not confined only to a particular category and can be used in various fields like research, technology, and health. AI mainly concentrates on how computers analyze data and mimic the human thought process. As drug development involves high R & D costs and uncertainty in time consumption, artificial intelligence can serve as one of the promising solutions to overcome all these demerits. Due to the availability of enormous data, there are chances of missing out on some crucial details. To solve these issues, algorithms like machine learning, deep learning, and other expert systems are being used. On successful implementation of AI in the pharmaceutical field, the delays in drug development, failure at the clinical and marketing level can be reduced. This review comprises information regarding the development of AI, its subfields, its overall implementation, and its application in the pharmaceutical sector and provides insights on challenges and limitations concerning AI.

Furthermore, individual differences (i.e., art expertise, openness to experience, holistic thinking), and the complexity of the stimuli are known to moderate the effect. We extended the study of individual differences to 2 theoretically relevant groups. Study 1 compared liking for curvature in individuals with autism and a matched neurotypical control group (for age, gender, and IQ). Because preference for curvature depends on both sensory (visuospatial) and affective input, for which individuals with autism exhibit anomalies, we hypothesized a difference in preference for curved stimuli between the 2 groups. Study 2 examined preference for curvature in a group of quasi-expert students of design. Because working architects and designers tend to regard curved interior spaces as beautiful, we hypothesized to replicate this effect within quasi-experts as well, thereby extending the effect across levels of expertise. Using an identical methodology across both studies, we administered abstract stimuli consisting of irregular polygons (angular vs. curved) and patterns of colored lines (angular vs. curved), as well as concrete stimuli consisting of images of interior spaces. Preference for curvature was confirmed with abstract stimuli in all 3 groups. For interior design, the curvature effect diminished in magnitude, and this was especially evident in individuals with autism. Interestingly, quasi-experts preferred rectilinear over curvilinear interiors. We discuss the results in relation to the impact of individual differences and expertise on preference for curvature, and their implication for design studies in ecologically valid settings.

The synthetic methods, relied on the versatilities of the maleimide moieties as a latent monomer which leads to an efficient alternative in various innovative applications, especially in self-healing material, self-reporting materials for real-time monitoring, and also in data storage and anticounterfeiting technologies. The core of the content in this review is focused on the up-to-data advances and publications on the major of maleimide chemistry in our research group. What is the most favorite and original chemistry developed in your research group? Maleimide chemistry in precision polymer synthesis. How do you get into this specific field? Could you please share some experiences with our readers? When I was a junior high school student, the chemistry attracted me very much. Chemistry is an extraordinary magic, which virtually generates molecules, basic units and everything on earth. I selected the polymer chemistry area when I pursuit my MSc and PhD in Soochow University. The polymer chemistry is the basic and originality of polymer science, which has created tremendous useful materials and greatly benefited humanity in the past century. Engaging in chemistry research is tedious and hard most of the time, but I like the joy and accomplishment at the moment when the experiment succeeds. It's like tea tasting, the kind of fleeting back sweetness makes me yearn and intoxicated. How do you supervise your students? I always encourage students to believe themselves, however don't always believe what others have said. The students should have their own judgments based on broad literature survey, comprehensive learning and deep thinking. The students should not take the publications but the improvements of research capability as the only target when pursuing the academic degree. What is the most important personality for scientific research? Be joyful, enthusiastic, persistent and careful. How do you keep balance between research and family? I like cooking for my family. Cooking is similar with chemical experiments. I think that cooking is a good balance between research and family.

Emotional Objectivity: Neural Representations of Emotions and Their Interaction with Cognition	ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY, VOL 71	Annual Review of Psychology		English	Review; Book Chapter						emotion; cognition; cognitive neuroscience; affective neuroscience; decoding emotion	VISUAL-CORTEX; MNEMONIC DISCRIMINATION; PATTERN SEPARATION; DELETION VARIANT; NEGATIVE EMOTION; MEMORY TRACES; HEART-RATE; AMYGDALA; BRAIN; ATTENTION	Recent advances in our understanding of information states in the human brain have opened a new window into the brain's representation of emotion. While emotion was once thought to constitute a separate domain from cognition, current evidence suggests that all events are filtered through the lens of whether they are good or bad for us. Focusing on new methods of decoding information states from brain activation, we review growing evidence that emotion is represented at multiple levels of our sensory systems and infuses perception, attention, learning, and memory. We provide evidence that the primary function of emotional representations is to produce unified emotion, perception, and thought (e.g., "That is a good thing") rather than discrete and isolated psychological events (e.g., "That is a thing. I feel good"). The emergent view suggests ways in which emotion operates as a fundamental feature of cognition, by design ensuring that emotional outcomes are the central object of perception, thought, and action.

A qualitative study	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article							PARTICIPATION	BackgroundRisk-stratified screening is being considered for national breast screening programmes. It is unclear how women experience risk-stratified screening and receipt of breast cancer risk information in real time. This study aimed to explore the psychological impact of undergoing risk-stratified screening within England's NHS Breast Screening Programme.MethodsIndividual telephone interviews were conducted with 40 women who participated in the BC-Predict study and received a letter indicating their estimated breast cancer risk as one of four risk categories: low (<2% 10-year risk), average (2-4.99%), above average (moderate; 5-7.99%) or high (>= 8%). Audio-recorded interview transcriptions were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.ResultsTwo themes were produced: 'From risk expectations to what's my future health story?' highlights that women overall valued the opportunity to receive risk estimates; however, when these were discordant with perceived risk, this causes temporary distress or rejection of the information. 'Being a good (woman) citizen' where women felt positive contributing to society but may feel judged if they then cannot exert agency over the management of their risk or access follow-up supportConclusionsRisk-stratified breast screening was generally accepted without causing long-lasting distress; however, issues related to risk communication and access to care pathways need to be considered for implementation.

This research area has developed an identity through a series of successful international conferences and the establishment of a journal. It has also been complemented through community activities such as international standardization efforts and GIS interoperability. Historically, much of the advancement in computational methods has occurred at-or close to-the implementation level, as exemplified by attention to the development of spatial access methods. :Significant progress has been made at the levels of spatial data models and spatial query languages, although we note the lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework comparable to the relational data model in database management systems. The difficult problems that need future research efforts are at the highly abstract level of capturing semantics of geographical information. A cognitive motivation is most promising as it shapes the focus on the users' needs and points of view, rather than on efficiency as in the case of a bottom-up system design. We also identify the need for new research in fields, models of qualitative spatial information, temporal aspects, knowledge discovery, and the integration of GIS with database management systems.

Personal mobile agents can help those people to search, to filter, to analyze, or to translate the large amount of Internet information. Since the context of a user may vary frequently, the way a personal mobile agent process the Internet information must adapt to the context change. However, we think that the current mainstream mobile agent platforms, such as the IBM Aglet and the IKV++ Grasshopper, are not good enough for developing context-aware applications. Hence, we propose a Component-based, Reconfigurable Mobile Agent (CRMA) system, which is designed for context-aware computing. It offers downloadable user-interface modules on terminal devices for application to adapt the characteristics of various terminal devices. In addition, on agent side, CRMA provides a reconfigurable agent-programming framework, which uses component-based pipelines to perform context-aware data-processing operations. This not only simplifies the programming task for dynamically reconfiguring an agent's behavior to adapt the context change, but also improves the reusability of agent software. In the end of this paper, we will propose a context-aware meta-search service to demonstrate how to use CRMA to develop a context-aware application.

This is largely due to its promise to propel biotechnology beyond its traditional realms in medicine, agriculture, and environment toward new territories historically dominated by the chemical and manufacturing industries-but now claimed to be amenable to complete biologization. For this to happen, it is crucial for the field to remain true to its foundational engineering drive, which relies on mathematics and quantitative tools to construct practical solutions to real-world problems. This article highlights several SynBio themes that, in our view, come with somewhat precarious promises that need to be tackled. First, SynBio must critically examine whether enough basic information is available to enable the design or redesign of life processes and turn biology from a descriptive science into a prescriptive one. Second, unlike circuit boards, cells are built with soft matter and possess inherent abilities to mutate and evolve, even without external cues. Third, the field cannot be presented as the one technical solution to many grave world problems and so must avoid exaggerated claims and hype. Finally, SynBio should pay heed to public sensitivities and involve social science in its development and growth, and thus change the technology narrative from sheer domination of the living world to conversation and win-win partnership.

This is a widely used tool to assess scientific production in several areas of knowledge. Such methodology analyzes publication trends, author networks, structures of co-citation, journals and even the scientific contribution of renowned scholars in science. The precursor of bibliometrics, Eugene Garfield, who proposes the retrieval of information from the indexing of citations, was the object of a scientometric review aimed at assessing his impact on science. Given such relevance, this article presents the academic contribution of Jurgen Habermas based on a preliminary scientometric review of his studies. Jurgen Habermas is regarded not only as an active scholar in the social and political process, but also as a productive, controversial and influential contemporary author. The correct understanding of his works is a great challenge, as the bases of his thinking are so broad that they allow an interface between different approaches. We elaborated a design of his scientific work with the advancement to a connection between his main ideas through the use of bibliometric software. Bibliometrics, of the scientometric type, allows the understanding of how recognized patterns in citations can develop information relevant to the scientific field. The results confirm the multidisciplinary contribution of Habermas's studies and highlight his main fields of research and works, which serve as a foundation for clearly understanding and applying his concepts.

Improving Efficiency and Effectiveness of Robotic Process Automation in Human Resource Management	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						robotic process automation; human resource management system; information technology	HRMS	Automation technology is changing and transforming innovation into the industrial landscape and Human Resources (HR) should ensure to adapt and practice its deployment to realise its benefits in time and for cost savings. The implementation of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in HR can help to offer better service to ensure compliance of the processes with standards and regulations. RPA is a software technology that manages software robots to emulate human actions when interacting with digital platforms. RPA is a solution that could perform repetitions to take over activities carried out by humans. However, a robot is not thought to be able to replace the HR but is, instead, useful to support driven processes. The purpose of the study is to prove the efficiency and effectiveness of RPA in the Human Resource Management System (HRMS) compared to the manual process performed by a human. Different types of components and characteristics were identified to adopt RPA in HRMS based on the data measurement in the implementation process. This study designs and develops an HRMS model using RPA tools to achieve the target process. The model was developed based on a case study of an existing model of RPA in HRMS from an IT consultancy industry. In the HR process, the project uses an application focusing on the parameters of gathering, storing and accessing employees' information from other modules. Lastly, the gaps in the HRMS to improve productivity are evaluated and explained.

J	Tan, KM; Ning, Y; Witten, DM; Liu, H				Tan, Kean Ming; Ning, Yang; Witten, Daniela M.; Liu, Han			Replicates in high dimensions, with applications to latent variable graphical models	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						Experimental design; Nuisance parameter; Pairwise decorrelated score test; Semiparametric exponential family graphical model	COVARIANCE ESTIMATION; DANTZIG SELECTOR; HUMAN BRAIN; LASSO; REGRESSION; DISCRETE	In classical statistics, much thought has been put into experimental design and data collection. In the high-dimensional setting, however, experimental design has been less of a focus. In this paper, we stress the importance of collecting multiple replicates for each subject in the high-dimensional setting. We consider learning the structure of a graphical model with latent variables, under the assumption that these variables take a constant value across replicates within each subject. By collecting multiple replicates for each subject, we can estimate the conditional dependence relationships among the observed variables given the latent variables. To test the hypothesis of conditional independence between two observed variables, we propose a pairwise decorrelated score test. Theoretical guarantees are established for parameter estimation and for this test. We show that our method is able to estimate latent variable graphical models more accurately than some existing methods, and we apply it to a brain imaging dataset.					ning, yang/JDW-5468-2023; Liu, Hanlong/JPE-5810-2023; Liu, Han/HMD-9231-2023	Liu, Han/0000-0002-5269-8477	NIH HHS [DP5 OD009145] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH102339] Funding Source: Medline; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1252624, 1454377] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1546462] Funding Source: National Science Foundation	NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)); Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE))			28	8	8	0	12	OXFORD UNIV PRESS	OXFORD	GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND	0006-3444	1464-3510		BIOMETRIKA	Biometrika	DEC	2016	103	4					761	+		10.1093/biomet/asw050	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asw050			34	Biology; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Statistics & Probability	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Mathematics	EI9FM	28736452	Green Accepted			2024-01-21	WOS:000392813200002

Student peer reviewers' views on teaching innovations and imaginative learning	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Article						Nursing student; Peer review; Imaginative learning; Problem-based learning; Focus group	MUSIC-THERAPY; HEALTH; THINKING; COMMUNITIES; PERCEPTIONS; FRAMEWORK; EDUCATION; TEACHERS; SCIENCE; POETRY	Background: Various teaching innovations have been proven effective in promoting students' critical thinking, creativity, problem solving and active learning. However, little attention has been paid to the possibility of including students as peer reviewers to evaluate these innovations in light of imaginative learning. Aim: This study explored the perspective of senior students who played the role of the student peer reviewer on three teaching innovations, namely writing poetry, composing songs and creating role-plays in problem-based learning (PBL), specifically in relation to imaginative learning. Design: A focus group interview. Methods: Ten senior nursing students who had experienced the conventional PBL approach but not the mentioned teaching innovations were invited to participate in reviewing a video recording of a PBL class using the above teaching innovations with a total of 18 junior year students. Results: Five themes were identified using content analysis: (i) motivation to learn, (ii) increased empathy, (iii) information retention, (iv) development of critical thinking and creativity, and (v) drawbacks of teaching innovations. Conclusions: It is suggested that student peer reviewers should be considered, as they can bring an outsider learner's views on understanding the impacts of teaching innovations on imaginative learning. A call should be made to invite student peer reviewers on teaching and learning approaches, and more effort should be devoted to promoting an understanding of how imaginative learning can be achieved via teaching innovations.

From lumping to splitting and back again: Atypical social and language development in individuals with clinical-high-risk for psychosis, first episode schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Language; Social; Neurodevelopment; Schizophrenia; Autism; Thought disorder	FORMAL THOUGHT-DISORDER; IMPAIRMENT; INTERVIEW; SYMPTOMS; PATHWAYS; DEFICITS; CHILDREN; MIND	Objective: Individuals with autism and schizophrenia exhibit atypical language and social symptoms. The extent to which these symptoms are evident during development and in current functioning is unclear. Method: Three groups of patients aged 11-20 diagnosed as clinical-high-risk for psychosis (CHR; n = 15), first episode psychosis (FEP; n = 16), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD; n = 20), plus typically developing individuals (TYP; n = 20) were compared on common autism parent-report questionnaires assessing social and language development and current functioning including the Social Communication Questionnaire, the Children's Communication Checklist, and the Social Reciprocity Scale. Results: All clinical groups demonstrated atypical social and language development, with social impairment highest in ASD. Twenty percent of participants with CHR and FEP met diagnostic criteria for ASD as assessed by parent-report. ASD exhibited greater current syntactic, and pragmatic language symptoms including delayed echolalia, pedantic speech, and deficits in appreciating irony and sarcasm. All clinical groups exhibited current deficits in social functioning. CHR and FE had similar and intermediate levels of functioning relative to ASD and TYP, with CHR generally scoring closer to TYP, providing construct validity for the CHR diagnostic label. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that ASDs, CHR, and FEP share common features of atypical neurodevelopment of language and social function. Evidence of impaired social reciprocity across both disorders and distinct language symptoms in ASDs provides important information for differential diagnosis and psychosis prevention, as well as leads for future investigations of comparative genetics and pathophysiology.

J	Busse, R; Warner, M; Zhao, SM				Busse, Ronald; Warner, Malcolm; Zhao, Shuming			In search of the roots of HRM in the Chinese workplace	CHINESE MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Review						China; Human relations	HAWTHORNE; PSYCHOLOGY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to trace back the roots of US-driven "Human Resource Management" (HRM) school of thought which now become widely institutionalized in China, up to the present day. Design/methodology/approach - It looks at the diffusion of management knowledge over the period to Chinese business, which involved in turn scientific management (SM), human relations (HR) and HRM, respectively, from the interwar years onwards, by using a bibliometric analysis of Chinese language sources, searching a number of databases now available. Findings - The authors scanned the international, as well as Chinese, literature to support a conjecture of a HR route towards China and how it morphed into HRM and went on to conclude that there was by the end of the year 2015 still a significant output of academic publications with references to both HR and HRM, respectively, but that we must be cautious in asserting a firm conclusion. Originality/value - This paper traces back the roots of Chinese HRM back to the US-driven HR school of thought.

However, the great diversity of the initiatives composing City Region Food Systems in Europe poses barriers to the assessment of their integrated sustainability. Hence, the present work is developed within the EU-H2020 project Food System in European Cities (FoodE), to build a consistent sustainability scoring system that allows comparative evaluation of City Region Food System Initiatives. Adopting a Life Cycle Thinking approach, it advances on existing knowledge and past projects, taking advantage of a participatory process, with stakeholders from multidisciplinary expertise. As a result, the research designs, and tests on 100 case studies a simplified and ready-to-use scoring mechanism based on a quali-quantitative appraisal survey tool, delivering a final sustainability score on a 1-5 points scale, to get insights on the social, economic, and environmental im-pacts.

J	Arnold, MG				Arnold, Marlen Gabriele			Combining conscious and unconscious knowledge within human-machine-interfaces to foster sustainability with decision-making concerning production processes	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Exploratory design; Structural systemic constellations; Cognitive human biases; HMI; Sustainable production contexts	CIRCULAR ECONOMY; SYSTEMS; BIAS; MANAGEMENT; COMPLEXITY; EDUCATION; DESIGN; MEMORY; TIME	At present, sustainability science is mainly based on conscious information and strongly focused on analytical tools or strategies. Neuroscience has made obvious that human decisions are prepared by the unconsciousness. Intuition plays an important role in early and late stages of learning processes and has a crucial impact on decision-making. Thus, intuitive and unconscious thinking is crucial for management processes in general and production planning processes in the main. However, unconscious knowledge and human behaviour is predominantly neglected in production research. Especially the addressing of human machine interfaces (HMI), human cognitive biases have a crucial impact on decision making processes. Constellation work is based on unconscious knowledge and intuition. Thus, systemic structural constellations are an innovative tool to integrate unconscious knowledge in a research context. In systemic structural constellations specific foci of complex systems, such as a production system, can be simulated and represented through spatial arrangements of persons or symbols. So, the method was used to reveal relevant patterns of relationships, structures, interaction, implicit knowledge, including hidden or underlying dynamics and influences that are relevant to and within a production system to understand how the raised problems in HMI can be better solved. The guiding research question is: How can the use of structural systemic constellations improve decision-making processes in HMI contexts in production environments in order to increase sustainability? Results show sustainability seems to be a matter of consciousness and is closely linked to the bias group not enough meaning. Sustainability and complexity resemble more than being linked by trade-offs. The recognition of human biases can be trained to improve human-machine-interfaces and sustainability. Constellation work contributes to decision theory by supporting effectuation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A growing, diverse sustainability modelling literature, however, does not readily lend itself to standard validation procedures, which are typically rooted in the positivist principles of empirical verification and predictive success. Yet, to be useful to decision-makers, models, including their outputs and the processes through which they are established must be, and must be seen to be "valid." This study explores what model validity means in a problem space with increasingly interlinked and fast-moving challenges. We examine validation perspectives through ontological, epistemic, and methodological lenses, for a range of modelling approaches that can be considered as "complexity-compatible." The worldview taken in complexity-compatible modelling departs from the more standard modelling assumptions of complete objectivity and full predictability. Drawing on different insights from complexity science, systems thinking, economics, and mathematics, we suggest a ten-dimensional framework for progressing on model validity when investigating sustainability concerns. As such, we develop a widened view of the meaning of model validity for sustainability. It includes (i) acknowledging that several facets of validation are critical for the successful modelling of the sustainability of complex systems; (ii) tackling the thorny issues of uncertainty, subjectivity, and unpredictability; (iii) exploring the realism of model assumptions and mechanisms; (iv) embracing the role of stakeholder engagement and scrutiny throughout the modelling process; and (v) considering model purpose when assessing model validity. We wish to widen the debate on the meaning of model validity in a constructive way. We conclude that consideration of all these elements is necessary to enable sustainability models to support, more effectively, decision-making for complex interdependent systems.

Methods: Healthy women (18-35 y), without conditions that impair cognition, were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Participants completed anthropometric and validated computerized cognitive assessments (IntegNeuroT). Performance on 5 cognitive domains (impulsivity, attention, information processing, memory, and executive function) was reported as z scores. Sitting hours and weekly PA calculated from time in low-, moderate-, and high-intensity activity were obtained via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Analysis of variance/analysis of covariance, chisquare, and linear regression were used. Results: 299 (25.9 [5.1] y) women (low PA = 19%; moderate PA = 40%; high PA = 41%) participated. High PA women had lower body mass index (high PA = 26.1 [6.5]; moderate PA = 30.0 [8.7]; low PA = 31.0 [11.1] kg/m(2); P < .001) and less sitting time (high PA = 6.6 [3.1]; moderate PA = 7.7 [2.8]; low PA = 9.3 [3.6] hr/weekday; P < .0001). Cognitive function was within normal ranges and did not differ between any PA groups (P = .42). Adjusting for body mass index, C-reactive protein, or sitting hours did not alter results. Weak correlations were found between time in high-intensity activity and impulsivity (b = 0.12, r(2) = .015; P = .04), and between sitting hours and information processing efficiency (b = -0.18, r(2) = .03; P = .002). Valuesare presented as mean (SD). Conclusions: Cognitive function was within the normal range, regardless of PA or sitting time.

Insight into the structural requirements of pyrimidine-based phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitors by multiple validated 3D QSAR approaches	SAR AND QSAR IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; phosphodiesterase 10A; k-nearest neighbour molecular field analysis; CoMFA; Topomer CoMFA; Open3DQSAR	MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; REAL EXTERNAL PREDICTIVITY; TOPOMER COMFA; BIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITY; SIMILARITY INDEXES; KINASE INHIBITORS; ANTICANCER AGENTS; FIELD ANALYSIS; 3D-QSAR; DOCKING	Schizophrenia is a complex disorder of thinking and behaviour (0.3-0.7% of the population is affected). The over-expression of phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) enzyme may be a potential target for schizophrenia and Huntington's disease. Because 3D QSAR analysis is one of the most frequently used modelling techniques, in the present study, five different 3D QSAR tools, namely CoMFA, CoMSIA, kNN-MFA, Open3DQSAR and topomer CoMFA methods, were used on a dataset of pyrimidine-based PDE10A inhibitors. All developed models were validated internally and externally. The non-commercial Open3DQSAR produced the best statistical results amongst 3D QSAR tools. The structural interpretations obtained from different methods were thoroughly analysed and were justified on the basis of information obtained from the crystal structure. Information from one method was mostly validated by the results of other methods and vice versa. In the current work, the use of multiple tools in the same analysis revealed more complete information about the structural requirements of these compounds. On the basis of the observations of the 3D QSAR studies, 12 new compounds were designed for better PDE10A inhibitory activity. The current investigation may help in further designing new PDE10A inhibitors with promising activity.	[Halder, A. K.; Amin, S.

J	Du, JTN; Spink, A				Du, Jia Tina; Spink, Amanda			Toward a Web Search Model: Integrating Multitasking, Cognitive Coordination, and Cognitive Shifts	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							INFORMATION-SEEKING; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; STRATEGIES; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN	Limited research has investigated the role of multitasking, cognitive coordination, and cognitive shifts during web search. Understanding these three behaviors is crucial to web search model development. This study aims to explore characteristics of multitasking behavior, types of cognitive shifts, and levels of cognitive coordination as well as the relationship between them during web search. Data collection included pre- and postquestionnaires, think-aloud protocols, web search logs, observations, and interviews with 42 graduate students who conducted 315 web search sessions with 221 information problems. Results show that web search is a dynamic interaction including the ordering of multiple information problems and the generation of evolving information problems, including task switching, multitasking, explicit task and implicit mental coordination, and cognitive shifting. Findings show that explicit task-level coordination is closely linked to multitasking, and implicit cognitive-level coordination is related to the task-coordination process; including information problem development and task switching. Coordination mechanisms directly result in cognitive state shifts including strategy, evaluation, and view states that affect users' holistic shifts in information problem understanding and knowledge contribution. A web search model integrating multitasking, cognitive coordination, and cognitive shifts (MCC model) is presented. Implications and further research also are discussed.

The monsoon thus has the rapt attention of the public and science community, providing an opportunity to improve weather and climate literacy and public engagement in science. Engaging the public to forecast weather and climate phenomenon through contests offers an innovative way to reach diverse audiences and increase weather and climate literacy. We describe a "Monsoon Fantasy Forecasting" game conducted in 2021 with approximately 300 participants. The game that engaged the public in the forecasting of monthly rainfall at cities in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. We report on the game's interactive design, results, and feedback. We show that the game attracted a diverse audience who was not the typical weather and climate enthusiast, and we provide suggestive results that the game may have influenced the players information-seeking behaviors. We argue that activities that provoke people to observe and think routinely about climate can help educate and build awareness about weather and climate issues.

Patients with delirium have increased risk of long-term cognitive dysfunction and mortality. The cause is unknown, which limits our ability to design therapeutic interventions. In patients undergoing surgery, low regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2), as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), is associated with postoperative neurological dysfunction (eg delirium and long-term cognitive impairment). However, the relationship between NIRS-derived rSO2 and neurological outcomes in critically ill patients is unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the utilization of NIRS-derived rSO2 in critically ill patients outside the operating theater. We aimed to examine the relationship between rSO2 and neurological outcomes as well as to report rSO2 values in this population. Methods: The following databases were searched from inception to August 14, 2017: Ovid MedLine, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Results: Of 1410 articles identified by the search strategy, 8 were ultimately selected for final review. Most (7 of 8) were published since 2014. These studies included a total of 213 patients primarily with shock or respiratory failure. A variety of devices were used to measure rSO2, including INVOS and FORESIGHT. The duration of recording varied from 5 minutes to 72 hours. Four of the 8 studies reported on neurological outcomes. In all 4 studies, rSO2 was lower in critically ill patients who were delirious compared to controls, but this was only statistically significant in 2 of the studies. The heterogeneity in devices and duration of recording precluded meta-analysis. Conclusions: There is limited literature describing rSO2 in critically ill patients outside the operating room. Although there may be a slight signal of an association between low rSO2 and delirium, more study is needed to explore this relationship.	[Bendahan, Nathaniel; Boyd, J.

It has been successfully applied in many fields, such as online fraud identification, loan approval, and medical diagnosis. Multi-granularity thinking is an effective information fusion method for solving problems in a multi-granular environment, which allows people to understand and analyze problems from multiple perspectives. However, there are few studies on building anomaly detection models using the idea of multi-fuzzy granules. To this end, this paper constructs a multi-fuzzy granules anomaly detection method by using a fuzzy rough computing model. In this method, a hybrid metric is first used to calculate the fuzzy relations. Then, two ranking sequences are constructed based on the significance of attributes. Furthermore, forward and reverse multi-fuzzy granules are constructed to define anomaly scores based on the ranking sequences. Finally, a multi-fuzzy granules-based anomaly detection algorithm is designed to detect anomalies. The experimental results compared with existing algorithms show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

J	Ecker, UKH; Hogan, JL; Lewandowsky, S				Ecker, Ullrich K. H.; Hogan, Joshua L.; Lewandowsky, Stephan			Reminders and Repetition of Misinformation: Helping or Hindering Its Retraction?	JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN MEMORY AND COGNITION			English	Article						Continued-influence effect; Misinformation; Myth debunking; Familiarity	CONTINUED INFLUENCE; MEMORY; INFORMATION; SCIENCE; HEALTH; MYTHS; INFERENCES; KNOWLEDGE; WARNINGS; FORMAT	People frequently rely on information even after it has been retracted, a phenomenon known as the continued influence effect of misinformation. One factor proposed to explain the ineffectiveness of retractions is that repeating misinformation during a correction may inadvertently strengthen the misinformation by making it more familiar. Practitioners are therefore often encouraged to design corrections that avoid misinformation repetition. The current study tested this recommendation, investigating whether retractions become more or less effective when they include reminders or repetitions of the initial misinformation. Participants read fictional reports, some of which contained retractions of previous information, and inferential reasoning was measured via questionnaire. Retractions varied in the extent to which they served as misinformation reminders. Retractions that explicitly repeated the misinformation were more effective in reducing misinformation effects than retractions that avoided repetition, presumably because of enhanced salience. Recommendations for effective myth debunking may thus need to be revised. Information that is thought to be true but then turns out to be incorrect so-called misinformation can affect people's thinking and decision making even after it has been clearly corrected by a credible source, and even if people understand and later remember the correction. It has been proposed that one reason why corrections are so ineffective is that a myth is often repeated when it is corrected explaining that vaccines do not cause autism almost necessarily repeats the association between vaccines and autism. This repetition can make the myth more familiar such that it comes to mind more easily in the future. Based on this notion, one recommendation to "myth debunkers" has been to avoid myth repetition in a correction. The present study directly tested this recommendation. We presented participants with news reports that did or did not contain corrections; these corrections did or did not repeat the to-be-corrected misinformation explicitly. We found contrary to the popular recommendation that corrections were more effective when they explicitly repeated the myth. Thus, it seems "safe" and even beneficial to repeat the myth explicitly when debunking it.	[Ecker, Ullrich K.

J	Choi, JY; Lee, MJ				Choi, Jin-young; Lee, Myoung-jae			Score manipulation, density continuity and intent-to-treat effect for regression discontinuity	PACIFIC ECONOMIC REVIEW			English	Article							MAIMONIDES RULE; CLASS-SIZE; DESIGN; ELECTIONS	Regression discontinuity (RD) is widely used in many disciplines of science to find treatment effect when the treatment is determined by an underlying running variable ('score') S crossing a cutoff c or not. The main attraction of RD is local randomization around c, which is, however, often ruined by manipulation on S. To detect manipulation, the continuity of score density function fSs at c is routinely tested in practice. In this paper, we examine how informative fS is for RD, and show the following. First, for incumbency effect in election to which RD has been heavily applied, fS may have no information content. Second, for RD in general, the fS continuity is neither necessary nor sufficient for RD validity. Third, if the treatment cannot be implemented without manipulation of S, then the manipulation had better be considered as part of the treatment effect, much as in 'intent-to-treat effect' for clinical trials. These findings call for relying less on fS continuity tests and, instead, thinking more about how subjects react to the treatment to modify their S, how to design the treatment to lessen manipulation, and what to take as the desired treatment effect.

J	Chew, HSJ; Li, JY; Chng, S				Chew, Han Shi Jocelyn; Li, Jiayi; Chng, Samuel			Improving adult eating behaviours by manipulating time perspective: a systematic review and meta-analysis	PSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH			English	Review; Early Access						Consideration of future consequences; time perspective; eating behaviour; obesity; BMI; systematic review	TEMPORAL CONTEXT; FUTURE; INDIVIDUALS; INTENTIONS	There is a growing body of research on improving health behaviours through future thinking but that in improving eating behaviour remains unclear. Hence, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of time perspective manipulation in improving adult eating behaviours. Articles published from inception through 17 March 2022 were retrieved from eight databases (CINAHL, Embase, ProQuest, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, The Cochrane library, and Web of Science). Meta-analysis was conducted using random effects models with effect sizes reported in Hedges' g. Sixteen experimental studies were included, representing 1,914 participants with mean ages ranging from 20.5 to 44.1 years old and mean baseline BMI of 22.0 kg/m(2) to 37.2 kg/m(2). The interventions included were episodic future thinking (EFT; n = 12), message framing (n = 2), and varying inter-meal intervals (IMI; n = 2) in improving food choices, food intake and portion size. Two studies reported significant interventional effectiveness for domain-specific EFT while all studies on message framing and IMI reported significant interventional effectiveness. Message framing seemed to be more effective when both temporal distance and valence frames were manipulated. However, the pooled effect sizes of all the interventions did not result in a significant interventional effect (n = 5; g = -0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -1.44, 0.47; p = 0.23; I-2=87.2%). More rigorous research is needed to ascertain the effectiveness of manipulating time perspective in improving eating behaviours before such interventions are more widely used.

Previous research suggests that unsustainable land management practice is one of the factors exacerbating soil erosion, and that willingness to adjust this practice is closely linked to community land protection norms. The present research explores approaches to building stronger community norms and intentions linked to mitigating soil erosion among Maasai pastoralists in Northern Tanzania. In particular, we compare two impact approaches based on the information deficit model (exposure to scientific information) and the social identity framework (a group-based discussion). The results demonstrate that the information deficit approach results in stronger perceived land protection norms and, indirectly, stronger intentions, as compared to the discussion-based approach. We discuss contextual features that should be taken into account when interpreting these findings and suggest these may be key for impact approach choices.

A modular laboratory course using planarians to study genes involved in tissue regeneration	BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						Undergraduate; planarians; stem cells; course-based undergraduate research experience	RNA INTERFERENCE; BIOLOGY; SCIENCE; SUPPORT	Undergraduate research experiences are excellent opportunities to engage students in science alongside experienced scientists, but at large institutions, it is challenging to accommodate all students. To address and engage a larger number of students, we developed a modular laboratory course based on the course-based undergraduate research experiences model. This new course was integrated with the scientific aims of a research laboratory studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying tissue regeneration in planarians. In this course, students were asked to identify genes with roles in planarian biology. Students analyzed and cloned an assigned gene, determined its expression pattern in situ and examined its function in regeneration. Additionally, we developed critical thinking and scientific communication skills by incorporating activities focused on critical concepts. Students obtained high quality primary data and were successful in completing and mastering the course learning outcomes. They benefitted by developing basic research skills, learning to perform, trouble-shooting experiments, reading and critically analyzing primary literature, and using the information to defend and explain their experimental results. Through this course, students also increased their confidence and ability to perform independent scientific research. The course was designed to make it accessible to the community to implement and adapt as appropriate in diverse institutions.

In 3D DCMesh, each intellectual property (IP) core connects two optical routers (ORs) with perpendicular physical locations. Thus, every IP core has an additional path selection to play a certain role in redundant protection since it breaks the traditional thinking that each IP core connects only one OR. On the other hand, the previous fault-tolerant algorithm rudely treats the faulty ORs as invalid, resulting in low utilization of resources inside ORs. Hence, this paper proposes a fine-grained fault-tolerant algorithm based on microring resonator faults (FTM-MR), where some ORs along the transmission path can still work normally even if their internal MRs lose efficiency. The simulation results show that the solution in this study outperforms the previous related work by 10.86%-19.97%, 6.75%-8.83%, and 13.08%-18.8% for average insertion loss, crosstalk noise, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), respectively, under different topology sizes without OR-fault. It can improve the insertion loss performance, crosstalk noise, and the SNR by a maximum of 67.41%, 14.2%, and 187.63%, respectively, when the node failure rates are in the range of 50%.

Using the Technology Acceptance Model to explore community dwelling older adults' perceptions of a 3D interior design application to facilitate pre-discharge home adaptations	BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Occupational therapy; Pre-discharge home visits; Virtual reality; 3D; Collaboration; Engagement; Empowerment; Technology assisted care; Patient perceptions	HEALTH-CARE; SELF-MANAGEMENT; VIRTUAL-REALITY; PEOPLE; COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION; INVOLVEMENT; USABILITY; VISITS; AGE	Background: In the UK occupational therapy pre-discharge home visits are routinely carried out as a means of facilitating safe transfer from the hospital to home. Whilst they are an integral part of practice, there is little evidence to demonstrate they have a positive outcome on the discharge process. Current issues for patients are around the speed of home visits and the lack of shared decision making in the process, resulting in less than 50 % of the specialist equipment installed actually being used by patients on follow-up. To improve practice there is an urgent need to examine other ways of conducting home visits to facilitate safe discharge. We believe that Computerised 3D Interior Design Applications (CIDAs) could be a means to support more efficient, effective and collaborative practice. A previous study explored practitioners perceptions of using CIDAs; however it is important to ascertain older adult's views about the usability of technology and to compare findings. This study explores the perceptions of community dwelling older adults with regards to adopting and using CIDAs as an assistive tool for the home adaptations process. Methods: Ten community dwelling older adults participated in individual interactive task-focused usability sessions with a customised CIDA, utilising the think-aloud protocol and individual semi-structured interviews. Template analysis was used to carry out both deductive and inductive analysis of the think-aloud and interview data. Initially, a deductive stance was adopted, using the three pre-determined high-level themes of the technology acceptance model (TAM): Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), Actual Use (AU). Inductive template analysis was then carried out on the data within these themes, from which a number of sub-thmes emerged. Results: Regarding PU, participants believed CIDAs served as a useful visual tool and saw clear potential to facilitate shared understanding and partnership in care delivery. For PEOU, participants were able to create 3D home environments however a number of usability issues must still be addressed. The AU theme revealed the most likely usage scenario would be collaborative involving both patient and practitioner, as many participants did not feel confident or see sufficient value in using the application autonomously. Conclusions: This research found that older adults perceived that CIDAs were likely to serve as a valuable tool which facilitates and enhances levels of patient/practitioner collaboration and empowerment. Older adults also suggested a redesign of the interface so that less sophisticated dexterity and motor functions are required. However, older adults were not confident, or did not see sufficient value in using the application autonomously. Future research is needed to further customise the CIDA software, in line with the outcomes of this study, and to explore the potential of collaborative application patient/practitioner-based deployment.

The SBRs (called Q and T), operated under alternating anaerobic-aerobic conditions typical for EBPR, generated mixed microbial communities (sludges) demonstrating the GAO phenotype. Intracellular glycogen and poly-beta-hydroxyalkanoate (PHA) transformations typical of efficient EBPR occurred but polyphosphate was not bioaccumulated and the sludges contained 1.8% P (sludge Q) and 1.5% P (sludge T). 16S rDNA clone libraries were prepared from DNA extracted from the Q and T sludges. Clone inserts were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by restriction fragment length polymorphism banding profiles. OTU representatives were sequenced and phylogenetically analysed. The Q sludge library comprised four OTUs and all six determined sequences were 99.7% identical, forming a cluster in the gamma-Proteobacteria radiation. The T sludge library comprised eight OTUs and the majority of clones were Acidobacteria subphylum 4 (49% of the library) and candidate phylum OPU (39% of the library). One OTU (two clones, of which one was sequenced) was in the gamma-Proteobacteria radiation with 95% sequence identity to the Q sludge clones. Oligonucleotide probes (called GAOQ431 and GAOQ989) were designed from the gamma-Proteobacteria clone sequences for use in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH); 92 % of the Q sludge bacteria and 28 % of the T sludge bacteria bound these probes in FISH. FISH and post-FISH chemical staining for PHA were used to determine that bacteria from a novel gamma-Proteobacteria cluster were phenotypically GAOs in one laboratory-scale SBR and two fullscale wastewater treatment plants. It is suggested that the GAOs from the novel cluster in the gamma-Proteobacteria radiation be named 'Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis'.

It requires learners to be inquisitive and acquire skills to analyze problems to get to solutions critically. Unfortunately, students drop out of programming courses because students think that programming is difficult to understand. The student's understanding of the problem definition is one of the drawbacks that hinder them from accepting to solve problems. In addition to that, students also find the terminologies difficult to grasp. This study aims to determine whether visualization, interactivity, affective teaching, and the use of home language improve students' understanding. In this study, an application is designed to allow students to learn coding and their pre and the post-exam result was analyzed. The application incorporates animation, interaction, and examples in the home language. The result was tested at a 95% Confidence Level. It was found that the use of visualization and home language in teaching improves students' results and enhances their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

J	SCHAFFNER, KF				SCHAFFNER, KF			CLINICAL-TRIALS AND CAUSATION - BAYESIAN PERSPECTIVES	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							INFERENCE; STATISTICS; MODELS; LAWS	In addition to the safety, it is essential to establish the causal efficacy of extant and new treatments, and well-designed clinical trials are thought by most to be the 'gold standard' to accomplish this. Contrary to most statisticians' and regulators' views, however, I will argue that the concept of causation involved in clinical trials is not all that clear. I discuss the manipulability approach to causation, interpreted counterfactually, which seems to fit causation as it is found in such sciences as physiology, but it has unclear relations to a concept of causation proposed by a number of epidemiologists. I characterize 'epidemiological causation' as probabilistic and formulated at a population level, and dependent on certain general criteria for causation as well as study-design considerations. I then attempt to clarify the connections between these concepts of causation and Cartwright's views on complexity and causality, a 'Bayesian' framework proposed by Rubin and further elaborated by Holland, and Glymour and his colleagues' recent directed graphical causal modelling approach.

The Human Face as a Dynamic Tool for Social Communication	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Review							JAPANESE CULTURAL-DIFFERENCES; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; SEXUAL-DIMORPHISM; RECOGNIZE EMOTIONS; BASIC EMOTIONS; PERCEPTION; FEATURES; ATTRACTIVENESS; EVOLUTION; BRAIN	As a highly social species, humans frequently exchange social information to support almost all facets of life. One of the richest and most powerful tools in social communication is the face, from which observers can quickly and easily make a number of inferences about identity, gender, sex, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical health, attractiveness, emotional state, personality traits, pain or physical pleasure, deception, and even social status. With the advent of the digital economy, increasing globalization and cultural integration, understanding precisely which face information supports social communication and which produces misunderstanding is central to the evolving needs of modern society (for example, in the design of socially interactive digital avatars and companion robots). Doing so is challenging, however, because the face can be thought of as comprising a high-dimensional, dynamic information space, and this impacts cognitive science and neuroimaging, and their broader applications in the digital economy. New opportunities to address this challenge are arising from the development of new methods and technologies, coupled with the emergence of a modern scientific culture that embraces cross-disciplinary approaches. Here, we briefly review one such approach that combines state-of-the-art computer graphics, psychophysics and vision science, cultural psychology and social cognition, and highlight the main knowledge advances it has generated. In the light of current developments, we provide a vision of the future directions in the field of human facial communication within and across cultures.

Protein structure prediction is one of the most challenging problems in computational biology and chemistry, and has puzzled scientists for 50 years. The advent of AF2 presents an unprecedented progress in protein structure prediction and has attracted much attention. Subsequent release of structures of more than 200 million proteins predicted by AF2 further aroused great enthusiasm in the science community, especially in the fields of biology and medicine. AF2 is thought to have a significant impact on structural biology and research areas that need protein structure information, such as drug discovery, protein design, prediction of protein function, et al. Though the time is not long since AF2 was developed, there are already quite a few application studies of AF2 in the fields of biology and medicine, with many of them having preliminarily proved the potential of AF2. To better understand AF2 and promote its applications, we will in this article summarize the principle and system architecture of AF2 as well as the recipe of its success, and particularly focus on reviewing its applications in the fields of biology and medicine. Limitations of current AF2 prediction will also be discussed.

J	Chinn, D				Chinn, Deborah			Critical health literacy: A review and critical analysis	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Health literacy; Health inequalities; Health promotion; Concept definition; Health information; Social determinants; Empowerment; Review	PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY; CHRONIC DISEASE; EMPOWERMENT; KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION; INFORMATION; RECOMMENDATIONS; INEQUALITIES; PERCEPTIONS; PREVENTION	Though there has been a considerable expansion of interest in the health literacy concept worldwide, there has also been criticism that this concept has been poorly defined, that it stretches the idea of "literacy" to an indefensible extent and more specifically, that it adds little to the existing concerns and intervention approaches of the better established discipline of health promotion. This paper takes as a starting point the expanded model of health literacy advanced by Nutbeam (2000) and addresses these concerns by interrogating the concept of "critical health literacy" in order to draw conclusions about its utility for advancing the health of individuals and communities. The constituent domains of critical health literacy are identified; namely information appraisal, understanding the social determinants of health, and collective action, and as far as possible each are clearly delineated, with links to related concepts made explicit. The paper concludes that an appreciation of work undertaken in a range of different disciplines, such as media studies, medical sociology, and evidence-based medicine can enhance our understanding of the critical health literacy construct and help us understand its usefulness as a social asset which helps individuals towards a critical engagement with health information. There is some evidence that aspects of critical health literacy have indeed been found to be a resource for better health outcomes, but more research is needed in this area, both to develop quantitative and qualitative approaches to evaluating health literacy skills, and to offer convincing evidence that investment in programmes designed to enhance critical health literacy are worthwhile.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors deploy a conceptual approach developed with reference to a case study in order to explore the embedded logic of the current system of academic publishing. Findings - The analysis shows that rather than examining two seemingly different issues (predatory publishing vs established publishers) as conflictual dualism, it is more productive to conceive them in associative and mutually constitutive fashion. Research limitations/implications - A nuanced and multidimensional research approach is needed if we are to understand the dynamics of contemporary academic landscape. Originality/value - The originality of the contribution lies in its problematizing of three established approaches that feature debates on the transformation of the academy. It moves beyond a micro-level explanation by (the lack of) individual morality as well as a structural explanatory framework preoccupied with publishing infrastructure and culturalist approach based on ready-made dichotomies of west/north vs south/east. Instead, the analysis provides an account that engages both with morality and geopolitics whilst tackling them as dynamic processes in making.

J	Thiele, R; Wos, L				Thiele, R; Wos, L			Hilbert's twenty-fourth problem	JOURNAL OF AUTOMATED REASONING			English	Article						automated reasoning; proof refinement; Hilbert 24th problem		For almost a century, a treasure lay hidden in a library in Germany, hidden until a remarkable discovery was made. Indeed, for most of the twentieth century, all of science thought that Hilbert had posed twenty-three problems, and no others. In the mid-1990s, however, as a result of a thorough reading of Hilbert's files, a twenty-fourth problem was found (in a notebook, in file Cod. ms. D. Hilbert 600: 3), a problem that might have a profound effect on research. This newly discovered problem focuses on the finding of simpler proofs and criteria for measuring simplicity. A proof may be simpler than previously known in one or more ways that include length, size (measured in terms of the total symbol count), and term structure. A simpler proof not only is more appealing aesthetically (and has fascinated masters of logic including C. A. Meredith, A. Prior, and I. Thomas) but is relevant to practical applications such as circuit design and program synthesis. This article presents Hilbert's twenty-fourth problem, discusses its relation to certain studies in automated reasoning, and offers researchers with varying interests the challenge of addressing this newly discovered problem. In particular, we include open questions to be attacked, questions that (in different ways and with diverse proof refinements as the focus) may prove of substantial interest to mathematicians, to logicians, and (perhaps in a slightly different manner) to those researchers primarily concerned with automated reasoning.

For this purpose, articles and full-text papers in Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Eric databases between 2000-2021 were searched using the keywords "educational games", "serious games", "game-based learning", "adapt*", "player modeling", "user modeling". After applying the inclusion and exclusion procedures of studies accessed in the search, 26 studies were included in the study. The studies were analyzed in line with the themes determined for the components used in the adaptation of educational games. According to the results, adaptive educational game design was made for a wide variety of fields such as programming teaching, physics, mathematics, computational thinking, and logic. As for adaptive factors; It was determined that adaptations were made for the game, educational content, interface, and non-player character (NPC) behaviors. It is understood that pre-game adaptation and in-game adaptation methods are used as adaptation types. Finally, it is seen that Bayesian networks, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, deep learning, item response theory, and decision tree methods are preferred as decision systems in the adaptation process. The findings of this literature review can facilitate the design process by providing a roadmap for researchers interested in adaptive educational game design.

Agile methods are widely used and tested in Software Engineering (SE) to deal with problems of the characteristics above. Because of this, after establishing that both OR interventions, as well as SE developments, have common stages and information evolution, this proposal aims to pose the challenge of applying agility to manage OR projects. Guidelines to adapt Agile Methodologies to OR are proposed, and a case vignette is studied as an initial test. Finally, future lines of work are considered to define how the larger project in which this proposal is embedded will continue.

A multifaceted approach to neuroscience outreach: Meeting the challenges	NEUROSCIENTIST			English	Article						neurosciences; career choice; educational activities		UK government targets aim for 50% of 18- to 30-year-olds entering higher education; however, with the vast choice of subjects to study available at this level, it is important to help pupils make informed decisions. As part of this process, awareness of newer fields such as neuroscience, which is not on the syllabus for science at school, needs to be promoted. Various challenges face neuroscientists working with visiting school pupils, including the lack of appropriate teaching resources, the culture and language barrier, and the risk of misinterpretation through oversimplification. The authors have designed a workshop to promote neuroscience and related scientific issues with school pupils aged 16 to 18 years. Pupil feedback showed that awareness of options within science increased after the workshop. The workshop also used resources taken from an undergraduate course successfully, demonstrating that appropriate resources are already available. A practical session using human brains was most popular, with all pupils believing it to be thought provoking and interesting. The final session aimed to challenge stereotypes within science, and despite the lowest pupil ratings overall, the majority agreed this. aim was met. Pupils reported that the workshop was interesting and that the information about options within science useful. The most impressive outcome was that, although no pupil recorded less inclination to continue in science following the workshop, 46% said that they were more likely to do so. These data confirm the importance of outreach work for pupils' interest and career choice.

Debate is an active teaching strategy long recognised in many disciplines to promote student centred learning by enhancing the development of communication skills, collaboration, and critical thinking, all of which are essential skill for future nurses. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare in-class university structured debate implementation methods among undergraduate nursing students, and to identify the effect of such debate methods in the students' learning. Design: A systematic review of the literature. Data sources: Publications in English identified in multiple databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Medline and ERIC) from the launch of the database until 26th November 2019. Review method: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guided the review. Studies that investigated the use of in-class debate among undergraduate nursing students as a pedagogical tool were eligible. Information related to the study design, debate process characteristics, evaluation method of the teaching strategy and results were collected. Results: We identified 14 relevant studies describing structured implementation of debate, 11 of which were instructional design and 3 quasi-experimental studies. Heterogeneity was found across the papers regarding topics, timing schedules, group formation and positioning. Most of the studies evaluated implementation using satisfaction questionnaires or subjective observations. Three quasi-experimental studies reported that implementation of debating improved declarative capacity, argumentative capacity, idealistic moral judgment, and realistic moral judgment. Conclusions: Current studies do not provide enough evidence to understand the scope of structured debating as an instrument to develop personal competences needed in nursing. However, based on the evidence reviewed, we have identified elements to establish a debate-based learning format that might enhance student's learning and future studies.

In the FANFAR project, a pre-operational flood early warning system (FEWS) for western Africa was co-designed in workshops with 50-60 stakeholders from 17 countries, adopting multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). We aimed at (i) designing a FEWS with western African stakeholders using MCDA and (ii) evaluating participatory MCDA as a transdisciplinary process. To achieve the first aim (i), we used MCDA methods for problem structuring and preference elicitation in workshops. Problem structuring included stakeholder analysis, creating 10 objectives to be achieved by the FANFAR FEWS and designing 11 possible FEWS configurations. Experts predicted FEWS configuration performance, which we integrated with stakeholder preferences. We tested MCDA results in sensitivity analyses. Three FEWSs showed good performance, despite uncertainty, and were robust across different preferences. For stakeholders it was most important that the FEWS produces accurate, clear, timely, and accessible flood risk information. To achieve the second aim (ii), we clustered common characteristics of collaborative governance frameworks from the sustainability science and transdisciplinary literature. Our framework emphasizes issues crucial to the earth systems sciences, such as uncertainty and integrating interdisciplinary knowledge. MCDA can address both well. Other strengths of MCDA are co-producing knowledge with stakeholders and providing a consistent methodology with unambiguous, shared results. Participatory MCDA including problem structuring can contribute to co-designing a project but does not achieve later phases of transdisciplinary processes well, such as co-disseminating and evaluating results. We encourage colleagues to use MCDA and the proposed framework for evaluating transdisciplinary hydrology research that engages with stakeholders and society.

In particular, disinformation in the health care sector can lead to serious casualties, as the current COVID-19 crisis clearly shows. Objective: The main aim of this study was to experimentally examine the effects of information about the source and a protective warning message on users' critical evaluation of news items, as well as the perception of accuracy of the news item. Methods: A 3 (unreliable vs reliable vs no identified source) x 2 (with protective message vs without) between-subject design was conducted among 307 participants (mean age 29 (SD 10.9] years). Results: The results showed a significant effect of source information on critical evaluation. In addition, including a protective message did not significantly affect critical evaluation. The results showed no interaction between type of source and protective message on critical evaluation. Conclusions: Based on these results, it is questionable whether including protective messages to improve critical evaluation is a way to move forward and improve critical evaluation of health-related news items, although effective methodologies to tackle the spread of disinformation are highly needed.

In order to minimize its implementation complexity, the monitor provided by Java is quite primitive. This design decision prefers simple concurrent objects and single-thread programs. However, we think the Java monitor is over simplified for developing more elaborated concurrent objects. Besides, several features of the Java monitor will bring extra overhead when thread contention gets higher. Currently, we have identified five drawbacks of the Java monitor. In this paper, we will first analyze these drawbacks in depth, and then propose a new monitor-based synchronization mechanism called EMonior. It has better expressive power, and introduces fewer overheads than the Java monitor when contention occurs. EMonior uses a preprocessor to translate the Java programs containing EMonitor syntax to regular Java programs that invoke EMonitor class libraries. It is very suitable to replace the Java monitor with the EMonitor when developing elaborate concurrent objects or high-contention concurrent systems.

J	Clarke, C				Clarke, Christopher			Why Your Causal Intuitions are Corrupt: Intermediate and Enabling Variables	ERKENNTNIS			English	Article; Early Access							STRUCTURAL EQUATIONS; TRANSITIVITY; PREEMPTION	When evaluating theories of causation, intuitions should not play a decisive role, not even intuitions in flawlessly-designed thought experiments. Indeed, no coherent theory of causation can respect the typical person's intuitions in redundancy (pre-emption) thought experiments, without disrespecting their intuitions in threat-and-saviour (switching/short-circuit) thought experiments. I provide a deductively sound argument for these claims. Amazingly, this argument assumes absolutely nothing about the nature of causation. I also provide a second argument, whose conclusion is even stronger: the typical person's causal intuitions are thoroughly unreliable. This argument proceeds by raising the neglected question: in what respects is information about intermediate and enabling variables relevant to reliable causal judgment?

They are brainstorming method, brain-writing method, mind mapping, NM method, Equivalent Transformation method, KJ method, etc. Human thinking process for creative problem solving consists of four sub-processes. They are divergent thinking sub-process, convergent thinking sub-process, idea crystallization sub-process, and idea veri. cation sub-process. In accordance with this proposal, most Japanese research and development is centered on this four types of creative thinking manual methods and support systems. In this paper, we describe three types of Group Decision Support Systems (DSSs) for creative problem solving, similar to KJ method. All design philosophy depends on bottom-up decision-making. They are knowledge acquisition support groupware GRAPE, consensus-making support systems Group Coordinator (I) and Group Coordinator (II). The characteristic function of GRAPE is knowledge merging for GRAPE users, and that of Group-Coordinator (I) and Group-Coordinator (II) is tradeoff resolution by sensitivity analysis and adjusting of user requirements by the QDA method, respectively. The systems that we have developed are similar to the KJ method, which is the most popular methodology for creative problem solving in Japan. The essence of our developed methodology and tools is that it boosts intellectual productivity. GRAPE and its successors can speed-up the given group decision making problem by two to three times with respect to the idea crystallization (evaluation and judgment) sub-process.

J	Li, J; Yu, N				Li, Jing; Yu, Ning			Key Technology of Virtual Roaming System in the Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Paintings	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Solid modeling; Computational modeling; Painting; Three-dimensional displays; Data models; Cultural differences; Virtual reality; Virtual roaming; high-imitative calligraphy and painting; digital museum; digital system	DIGITAL MUSEUM	To show the traditional Chinese painting and the spiritual culture of universities, highlight the artistic accumulation and cultural heritage, analyze the value and significance of digitalizing the Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting, Qingdao Agricultural University (QAU) is regarded as the research object. The design principles of the digital museum are clarified by understanding the specific user needs, and the 3DS Max is utilized to develop a roaming system for the Museum of Ancient High-Imitative Calligraphy and Painting of QAU through Unity3d, a Virtual Reality (VR) software platform. Besides, the perspective control, collision detection of virtual characters and scenes, and control of pop-up information display windows are realized to achieve the interactive design of users and the QAU digital museum system. Finally, from the four aspects of resource content, information presentation, resource presentation, and learning effect, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted. The research results show that more than 80% of people think that the content satisfaction of virtual system resources is high, which is more scientific and accurate; more than 65% think that the information is presented better, and 87% think that the system is open enough; in addition, nearly one-third of the visitors believe that using the system can initiate their interest and motivation in learning. This shows that the learning and cultural communication effects of the virtual system are more obvious. This system realizes the objective of disseminating traditional classic art culture and values by new technical means, which has reference significance for research in other fields.

J	Zhang, F; Zhang, L; Guo, YL; Zhang, H				Zhang, Fan; Zhang, Lu; Guo, Yanlong; Zhang, Han			A Study on Female Consumers' Perceptions of the Health Value of Visual Elements of Weight Loss Health Product Packaging	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						female consumers; weight loss health product packaging; visual elements; health value perception	FOOD CHOICE; OBESITY; INFORMATION; DESIGN; CLAIMS; COLOR; TASTE; SIZE; CUES	The obesity epidemic has evolved into a significant problem globally and poses a serious threat to the health of society. Despite increasing international research on obesity food packaging, the health value of visual elements in weight loss supplement packaging varies according to regional cultures and consumer groups. The scope of this study is the health perceptions of obese urban Chinese women regarding the design of visual elements of weight loss health product packaging. This study constructed a visual element index system for weight loss health product packaging in order to design a related questionnaire. The research team administered the online questionnaire to 305 obese women (aged 18-45+) in urban China from 22 June to 2 July 2022. The factors influencing the perceived health value of weight loss supplement packaging in the female obese group were examined using SPSS 26.0. A t-test analysis was conducted to derive the difference in the correlation between purchase status and brand identity. Linear regression analysis showed that age groups differed in package color and package shape, respectively. The study concluded that, first, there were differences in the perceptions of weight loss health product packaging among respondents with different purchase statuses; second, the older the respondents were, the more they perceived white packaging as having health value (p < 0.05); third, the health marker's shape had little or no statistical significance on the individuals (p > 0.05); fourth, respondents who were older were more likely to think a cylindrical design has a benefit for their health than a square box shape (p < 0.05) and an anthropomorphic shape was more likely to produce a healthy weight loss effect than cylindrical packaging (p < 0.05); and younger people thought that an anthropomorphic shape was more likely to make them recognize the health effect than square box-shaped packaging (p < 0.05).

This spectrometer, named LUVIMS (Lunar UV and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer), is characterized by high performances-high spectral, high spatial resolution-being at the same time small, light weight and has a low power consumption. An imaging spectrometer, operating in the visible and infrared, is able to provide information about lunar mineralogical composition. By means of LUVIMS it will be possible to identify most of the mineralogical species and to relate their distribution with the surface morphology. LUVIMS scientific objectives concerned the geochemical characterization of the Moon's surface in terms of global mapping, identification of different material and their distribution, mineralogical analysis of different terrain observations with high spatial resolution added to high spectral resolution can be the most powerful technique to have information on the lunar material origin and evolution. The spectrometer has been designed in order to work properly on either a tri-axis stabilized or a spinning spacecraft. In fact MORO has being studied as a candidate mission for the third cycle of Medium size missions, M3, in the framework of ESA's Horizon 2000 scientific programme. During the assessment phase, parametric solutions have been evaluated, but it has been shown that LUVIMS can fulfil the scientific requirements in any of the proposed spacecraft configurations. During phase A of the MORO mission the three-axis stabilized option has been selected, however it is thought that the evaluation of the performance of LUVIMS for a spinning spacecraft can be relevant also for other small spinning satellites.

The disease is associated with an abnormally folded prion protein, PrP-res, which is thought to form due to interaction between normal prion PrPC and PrP-es. Small peptides were designed to prevent this interaction. A structure-activity relationship is described for a series of peptides which were synthesised and tested for their activity against two prion disease model assays, an in vitro cellular assay and an in vitro anti-aggregation polymerisation assay. A number of peptides were found to be active at levels of 100 mu M. New libraries were synthesised in order to concentrate on discovering new, shorter peptides which could be leads for developing peptidomimetics. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Non-pharmacological interventions for sleep promotion in hospitalized children	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; MULTICENTER POINT PREVALENCE; CRITICALLY-ILL CHILDREN; ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE; EARLY MOBILIZATION; IMPROVE SLEEP; DELIRIUM; LIGHT; EXPERIENCE; PICU	Background Healthy sleep is an important component of childhood development. Changes in sleep architecture, including sleep stage composition, quantity, and quality from infancy to adolescence are a reflection of neurologic maturation. Hospital admission for acute illness introduces modifiable risk factors for sleep disruption that may negatively affect active brain development during a period of illness and recovery. Thus, it is important to examine non-pharmacologic interventions for sleep promotion in the pediatric inpatient setting. Objectives To evaluate the effect of non-pharmacological sleep promotion interventions in hospitalized children and adolescents on sleep quality and sleep duration, child or parent satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, delirium incidence, length of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and mortality. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, three other databases, and three trials registers to December 2021. We searched Google Scholar, and two websites, handsearched conference abstracts, and checked reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs, including cross-over trials, investigating the effects of any non-pharmacological sleep promotion intervention on the sleep quality or sleep duration (or both) of children aged 1 month to 18 years in the pediatric inpatient setting (intensive care unit [ICU] or general ward setting). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, evaluated risk of bias, extracted and synthesized data, and used the GRADE approach to assess certainty of evidence. The primary outcomes were changes in both objective and subjective validated measures of sleep in children; secondary outcomes were child and parent satisfaction, cost-effectiveness ratios, delirium incidence or delirium-free days at time of hospital discharge, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and mortality. Main results We included 10 trials (528 participants; aged 3 to 22 years) in inpatient pediatric settings. Seven studies were conducted in the USA, two in Canada, and one in Brazil. Eight studies were funded by government, charity, or foundation grants. Two provided no information on funding. Eight studies investigated behavioral interventions (massage, touch therapy, and bedtime stories); two investigated physical activity interventions. Duration and timing of interventions varied widely. All studies were at high risk of performance bias due to the nature of the intervention, as participants, parents, and staff could not be masked to group assignment. We were unable to perform a quantitative synthesis due to substantial clinical heterogeneity. Behavioral interventions versus usual care Five studies (145 participants) provided low-certainty evidence of no clear difference between multicomponent relaxation interventions and usual care on objective sleep measures. Overall, evidence from single studies found no clear differences in daytime or nighttime sleep measures (33 participants); any sleep parameter (48 participants); or daytime or nighttime sleep or nighttime arousals (20 participants). One study (34 participants) reported no effect of massage on nighttime sleep, sleep efficiency (SE), wake after sleep onset (WASO), or total sleep time (TST) in adolescents with cancer. Evidence from a cross-over study in 10 children with burns suggested touch therapy may increase TST (391 minutes, interquartile range [IQR] 251 to 467 versus 331 minutes, IQR 268 to 373; P = 0.02); SE (76, IQR 53 to 90 versus 66, IQR 55 to 78; P = 0.04); and the number of rapid eye movement (REM) periods (4.5, IQR 2 to 5 versus 3.5, IQR 2 to 4; P = 0.03); but not WASO, sleep latency (SL), total duration of REM, or per cent of slow wave sleep. Four studies (232 participants) provided very low-certainty evidence on subjective measures of sleep. Evidence from single studies found that sleep efficiency may increase, and the percentage of nighttime wakefulness may decrease more over a five-day period following a massage than usual care (72 participants). One study (48 participants) reported an improvement in Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire scores after discharge in children who received a multicomponent relaxation intervention compared to usual care. In another study, mean sleep duration per sleep episode was longer (23 minutes versus 15 minutes), and time to fall asleep was shorter (22 minutes versus 27 minutes) following a bedtime story versus no story (18 participants); and children listening to a parent-recorded story had longer SL than when a parent was present (mean 57.5 versus 43.5 minutes); both groups reported longer SL than groups who had a stranger-recorded story, and those who had no story and absent parents (94 participants; P < 0.001). In one study (34 participants), 87% (13/15) of participants felt they slept better following massage, with most parents (92%; 11/12) reporting they wanted their child to receive a massage again. Another study (20 participants) reported that parents thought the music, touch, and reading components of the intervention were acceptable, feasible, and had positive effects on their children (very low-certainty evidence). Physical activity interventions versus usual care One study (29 participants) found that an enhanced physical activity intervention may result in little or no improvement in TST or SE compared to usual care (low-certainty evidence). Another study (139 participants), comparing play versus no play found inconsistent results on subjective measures of sleep across different ages (TST was 49% higher for the no play groups in 4- to 7-year olds, 10% higher in 7- to 11-year olds, and 22% higher in 11- to 14-year olds). This study also found inconsistent results between boys and girls (girls in the first two age groups in the play group slept more than the no play group). No study evaluated child or parent satisfaction for behavioral interventions, or cost-effectiveness, delirium incidence or delirium-free days at hospital discharge, length of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, or mortality for either behavioral or physical activity intervention. Authors' conclusions The included studies were heterogeneous, so we could not quantitatively synthesize the results. Our narrative summary found inconsistent, low to very low-certainty evidence. Therefore, we are unable to determine how non-pharmacologic sleep promotion interventions affect sleep quality or sleep duration compared with usual care or other interventions. The evidence base should be strengthened through design and conduct of randomized trials, which use validated and highly reliable sleep assessment tools, including objective measures, such as polysomnography and actigraphy.

Although steroids are widely thought to reduce the effect of surgical trauma, the observation index is not uniform, so the issue is still controversial. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of local epidural steroids application following PEID. Methods: We will search the following databases from their inception to August 2020, PubMed, Embase, Medline, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Web of Science, Wan Fang Database, Cochrane Library. The search strategy includes the MeSH terms. Meta-analysis will be performed using Rev Man V.5.3.5 statistical software. Results: This study will provide a high-quality synthesis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of local epidural steroids following PEID. Conclusion: This systematic review will provide evidence to judge whether local epidural steroids application following PEID is an effective and safe intervention for patients. It will provide reliable evidence for its extensive application.

Not only the Internet and airline routes can be thought of as networks: protein interactions are also networks. An economic network design problem can be discussed by assuming that a vertex is an economic player and that a link represents some connection between economic players. In this paper, the Airlines network is taken up as an example of an economic network design problem, and the Airlines network which the profit of the entire Airlines industry is maximized is clarified. The Airlines network is modeled based on connections models proposed by Jackson and Wolinsky, and the utility function of the network is defined. In addition, the optimization simulation using the evolutionary computation is shown for a domestic airline in Japan. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Huang, TC				Huang, Tien-Chi			Seeing creativity in an augmented experiential learning environment	UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY			English	Article						Augmented reality; Google Glass; Remote associates test; Creativity; Self-efficacy	SELF-EFFICACY; REALITY; PRODUCTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; INCUBATION; EDUCATION; DESIGN; MODEL	In recent years, augmented reality (AR) technology has opened up new opportunities for building more attractive and pedagogical learning settings and is regarded as a type of next-generation pedagogical media for promoting learning quality, especially for outdoor exploration activities. This study develops a new learning paradigm in outdoor co-space and implements a mobile AR system for a creative design course unit. Based on Kolb's experiential learning theory, we develop an innovative teaching scheme and implement a learning system consisting of a mobile app designed for use with Google Glass, an Android-based smartphone, and a web-based platform. The Remote Associates Test (RAT) is used to assess critical thinking skills for problem solving. The proposed system implements a game-based learning activity consisting of RAT question generation and answering. Experiments were conducted with 36 students to assess system usability and learning effectiveness. In post-activity interviews, the students suggested that the use of real stimuli in the authentic environment improved learning effectiveness. Results also indicated that the question generation process had a more significant impact than question answering. Moreover, more than 90% of participants indicated that they were more likely to employ associative strategies and expose themselves to novel experiences after engaging in the associative training. It is expected that the proposed system can provide improved accessibility to other subject domains, such as language learning, eco-education, and social science education.

However, it is unclear whether such eHealth usability evaluation methods are also applicable with elderly users. This study aims to examine the challenges in applying eHealth usability evaluation methods with elderly users and how these challenges can be overcome. We chose three established eHealth usability evaluation methods to evaluate an eHealth intervention: (1) Co-Discovery Evaluation, (2) Cooperative Usability Testing, and (3) Remote User Testing combined with Think Aloud. The case study was conducted with seven Austrian elderly users. We supplemented the case study (March, 2021) with a systematic review (March, 2022) to identify (1) applied eHealth usability evaluation methods to elderly and (2) challenges of eHealth usability evaluations with elderly. Our results showed that Remote User Testing combined with Think Aloud could successfully be applied to evaluate the eHealth intervention with elderly users. However, Cooperative Usability Testing and Co-Discovery Evaluation were not suitable. The results of the systematic review showed that user-based eHealth usability evaluation methods are mostly applied to conduct eHealth usability evaluations with elderly users. Overall, the results showed that not all established eHealth usability evaluation methods are applicable with elderly users. Based on the case study and the systematic review, we developed 24 recommendations on how to deal with challenges during eHealth usability evaluations. The recommendations contribute to improving the accessibility, acceptability, and usability of eHealth interventions by the elderly.

Here, we establish libraries of glioma-initiating cell (GIC) clones from patient samples and find extensive molecular and phenotypic variability among clones, including a range of responses to radiation and drugs. This widespread variability was observed as a continuumof multitherapy resistance phenotypes linked to a proneural-mesenchymal shift in the transcriptome. Multitherapy resistance was associated with a semi-stable cell state that was characterized by an altered DNA methylation pattern at promoter regions of mesenchymal master regulators and enhancers. The gradient of cell states within the GIC compartment constitutes a distinct form of heterogeneity. Our findings may open an avenue toward the development of new therapeutic rationales designed to reverse resistant cell states.

RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Sustainability Science and Estuarine Habitat Restoration held at the Biennial Estuarine Research Federation Conference	SEP 14-18, 2003	Washington, DC	Soc Ecol Restorat, Int Estuarine Res Federat		docks; eelgrass; nearshore; net ecosystem improvement; restoration; sustainability	RESTORATION PROJECTS; ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT	The global human population is growing exponentially, close to a majority lives and works near the coast, and coastal commerce and development are critical to the economies of many nations. Hence, coastal areas will continue to be a major focus of development and economic activity. People desire the economic advantages provided by coastal development along with the fisheries and social commodities supported by estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Because of these facts, we view the challenge of balancing coastal development with enhancing nearshore marine and estuarine ecosystems (i.e., net ecosystem improvement) as the top priority for coastal researchers in this century. Our restoration research in Pacific Northwest estuaries and participation in nearshore project design and impact mitigation has largely dealt with these competing goals. To this end, we have applied conceptual models, comprehensive assessment methods, and principles of restoration ecology, conservation biology, and adaptive management to incorporate science into decisions about uses of estuarine systems. Case studies of Bainbridge Island and the Columbia River demonstrate the use of objective, defensible methods to prioritize tidally influenced shorelines and habitats (i.e., riparian forests, marshes, unvegetated flats, rocky shores, seagrass meadows, kelp forests) for preservation, conservation, and restoration. Case studies of Clinton, Washington, and Port Townsend, Washington, demonstrate the incorporation of an ecological perspective and technological solutions into design of overwater structures to minimize impacts on nearshore ecosystems. Adaptive management has allowed coastal development and restoration uncertainties to be better evaluated, with the information used to improve management decisions. Although unproven on a large scale, we think these kinds of methods can contribute to the net improvement of already degraded ecosystems. The ingredients include applied science to understand the issues, education, incentives, empirical data, cumulative impact analysis, and an effective adaptive management program. Because the option of net ecosystem improvement is often more costly than alternatives such as no net loss, commitment by the local or regional community to this approach is essential.

A fault diagnosis and sliding mode fault-tolerant control algorithms are proposed for non-Gaussian uncertain stochastic distribution control systems with probability density function approximation error. The unknown input caused by model uncertainty can be considered as an exogenous disturbance, and the augmented observation error dynamic system is constructed using the thought of unknown input observer. Stability analysis is performed for the observation error dynamic system, and the H-infinity performance is guaranteed. Based on the information of fault estimation and the desired output probability density function, the sliding mode fault-tolerant controller is designed to make the post-fault output probability density function still track the desired distribution. This method avoids the difficulties of design of fault diagnosis observer caused by the uncertain input, and fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control are integrated. Two different illustrated examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Ruyobeza, B; Grobbelaar, SS; Botha, A				Ruyobeza, Barimwotubiri; Grobbelaar, Sara S.; Botha, Adele			Hurdles to developing and scaling remote patients' health management tools and systems: a scoping review	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						Remote patient management; Design framework; Accessibility; Versatility; Integration; Adoption and scalability	TECHNOLOGY; PROGRAM	Background: Despite all the excitement and hype generated regarding the expected transformative impact of digital technology on the healthcare industry, traditional healthcare systems around the world have largely remained unchanged and resultant improvements in developed countries are slower than anticipated. One area which was expected to significantly improve the quality of and access to primary healthcare services in particular is remote patient monitoring and management. Based on a combination of rapid advances in body sensors and information and communication technologies (ICT), it was hoped that remote patient management tools and systems (RPMTSs) would significantly reduce the care burden on traditional healthcare systems as well as health-related costs. However, the uptake or adoption of above systems has been extremely slow and their roll out has not yet properly taken off especially in developing countries where they ought to have made the greatest positive impact. Aim: The aim of the study was to assess whether or not recent, relevant literature would support the development of in-community, design, deployment and implementation framework based on three factors thought to be important drivers and levers of RPMTS's adoption and scalability. Methods: A rapid, scoping review conducted on relevant articles obtained from PubMed, MEDLINE, PMC and Cochrane databases and grey literature on Google and published between 2012 and May 2020, by combining a number of relevant search terms and phrases. Results: Most RPMTSs are targeted at and focused on a single disease, do not extensively involve patients and clinicians in their early planning and design phases, are not designed to best serve a specific catchment area and are mainly directed at post-hospital, disease management settings. This may be leading to a situation where patients, potential patients and clinicians simply do not make use of these tools, leading to low adoption and scalability thereof. Conclusion: The development of a user-centred, context-dependent, customizable design and deployment framework could potentially increase the adoption and scalability of RPMTSs, if such framework addressed a combination of diseases, prevalent in a given specific catchment area, especially in developing countries with limited financial resources.

However, social learning involves both a receiver (who learns), and a sender (who is learned from). Surprisingly, the joint evolution of traits for social learning has attracted little attention, even though learning by the receiver has consequences for the fitness of the sender. Accordingly, animals are observed to teach and mask, and thereby influence available information. Here, we provide a mathematical model to examine when reliable social learning emerges as a result of investment in traits for social and asocial learning, as well as teaching and masking. Our purpose is to provide a general framework for thinking about how social learning is impacted by sender-receiver joint evolution, so our model is heuristic; its aim is to delineate broad categories of direct and indirect selection on learning traits. Our findings lead us to theorise that social learning exists on a continuum. At one extreme, senders and receivers have strongly opposed interests, selecting for masking to combat informational parasitism; at the other extreme, strongly aligned interests lead to teaching to enhance social learning. Sophisticated, metabolically expensive traits for influencing social learning can evolve under either aligned or opposed interests, although the aim of their design differs. Furthermore, we find that traits for asocial learning should often be more sophisticated than traits for receiving, while receiving traits should often be more sophisticated than sender traits for teaching or masking.Significance statementLearning from group members is often crucial for survival, with social learning influencing the development of behaviours in domains as diverse as foraging, mate preference, and predator defence. Formal modelling has provided a good understanding of the conditions that favour social learning, given animals already have the ability to learn asocially. However, the success of social learning also depends on the behaviour of the group member who is learned from. For instance, group members may teach others how to hunt dangerous prey. Alternatively, knowledgeable individuals sometimes take actions to hinder learning, for instance, by disguising the location of a food cache. Here, we provide a unitary mathematical framework to study how behaviours of the group member who is learned from jointly evolve with those of the learner.

How African Pasts Can Inspire Alternative Responses to Climate Change: a Creative Writing Experiment	AFRICAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Sustainability; Climate change; Africanfuturism; Archaeology; Education; Ghana; Kenya		How can we use the past to help us solve today's urgent climate change concerns? Archaeology provides one way forward by providing a long-term view of what worked and what did not work in the past. Indigenous knowledge systems have long curated a range of survival strategies that provide powerful inspiration for thinking differently about sustainability. Inspired by Africanfuturism-or how writers of African descent have creatively reimagined Black futures-we explore how creative writing can mobilize the past to rethink climate change responses. We have designed this piece for use in middle and secondary school science, history, or literature classes. An introductory explanation and "what we know" sections provide teachers with the necessary framing and background knowledge. The two short stories could be assigned to 13-18-year-old students to illustrate the kind of reimagining they might pursue based on archaeological and oral historical information.

To describe how physicians and pharmacists respond to patients' information needs. To use patients', physicians',. and pharmacists' feedback to develop evidence-based treatment information sheets. DESIGN Qualitative study using focus groups and a grounded-theory approach. SETTING Three regions of Canada (British Columbia, Nova Scotia, and Ontario). PARTICIPANTS Eighty-eight patients, 27 physicians, and 35 pharmacists each took part in one of 19 focus groups. METHOD Purposeful and convenience sampling was used. A trained facilitator used a semistructured interview guide to conduct the focus groups. Analysis was completed by at least two research-team members. MAIN FINDINGS Patients wanted both general and specific information when considering medication treatments. They wanted basic information about the medical condition being treated and specific information about side effects, duration of treatment, and range of available treatment options. Physicians and pharmacists questioned the amount of side-effect and safety information patients wanted and thought that too much information might deter patients from taking their medications. Patients, physicians, and pharmacists supported the use of evidence-based treatment information sheets. CONCLUSION Patients and clinicians each appear to have a different understanding of what and how much information patients should receive about medications. Feedback from patients can be used to develop patient-oriented treatment information.

Effects of fear on donations to climate change mitigation	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Threat appeal; Pro-environmental behavior; Climate change	THREAT APPEALS; POLICY SUPPORT; IMPACT; METAANALYSIS; INFORMATION; DISSONANCE; PUNISHMENT; BEHAVIOR; EMOTION; SCIENCE	Despite 70 years of research, there is no consensus about the effects of threat messages on behavior, partly because of publication bias. The lack of consensus concerns situations such as climate change where people tend to believe that they cannot easily make a major difference. Using a 2 x 2, (threat, neutral) x (efficacy, no efficacy) between-subjects design, we tested four hypotheses: the effect of threat stimuli on (1) mitigation of climate change and (2) experienced fear depends on efficacy information, (3) threat stimuli increase monetary donations to mitigation regardless of efficacy information, and (4) the effect of the threat stimuli depends on political identity. The threat stimuli were climate change related pictures and a prompt to write either about one's knowledge of or about the threat of climate change. The efficacy stimuli were an efficacy related picture and written information about the efficacy of a climate change mitigating organization. We collected a representative online sample of 1517 U.S. citizens. The manipulations affected experienced fear and self-efficacy, but there was no statistically significant main effect of threat on donations nor a statistically significant interaction between threat and efficacy or between threat and political identity. It is concluded that threat appeals do not increase climate change mitigation behavior by more than a very small amount compared to making people think about the subject.

Design/methodology/approach To shed light on the relationship reputation-SED, two alternative models were tested, thought the use of structural equation model (SEM) and partial least squares (PLS), with longitudinal data. Findings Both models supported the hypotheses although the model linking reputation to SED was slightly better, questioning the use of SED by reputation leader companies. Research limitations/implications The paper study the linkage, sign and causality, between reputation and SED by introducing two alternative models. SED and reputation are receiving considerable attention into the business scope, although their relationship is not agreed by previous literature. There are contradictory evidences that lead us to question the sense of this relation. Practical implications The contribution will be of interest to managers in terms of the value of this type of reporting from a strategic point of view. If reputation favours this type of disclosures, these will be issues to be taken into account to obtain a better competitive advantage through market differentiation. Social implications The results will be of interest for future studies and actions aimed at regulating the improvement of this type of reporting not only in the hands of academics and practitioners but also investors and regulators. Originality/value This study is an advance in the description of the SED-reputation relationship and contributes to this new line of research with new insights. Another contribution is the way to understand sustainability reporting. This paper analyses SED from the twofold point of view of the quantity of information and, the existing references about its quality and adding the lag effect between both variables.

FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						prevention programs; child mental health; family context; depression; anxiety	PREVENTION PROGRAMS; YOUNG-PEOPLE; SYMPTOMS; ADOLESCENTS; METAANALYSIS; UNIVERSAL; INTERVENTION; PREDICTORS; EFFICACY; HEALTH	Parent mental illness and family living arrangement are associated with depression and anxiety in children, and may influence the effects of programs that aim to prevent these disorders. This study investigated whether these family context factors moderated the intervention effects of the enhanced Aussie Optimism Positive Thinking Skills program on depression and anxiety in primary school children. The intervention was a universal, cognitive-behavioral program, with a one hour session each week for 10 weeks, delivered by trained teachers. The participants were 502 children from 13 private schools, aged 9-11, with 347 in the intervention group and 155 in the control group. There were 267 females and 235 males. Data from 502 parents was also included. A cluster randomized controlled trial design was used, including eight intervention schools and five control schools. Depression and anxiety were assessed at pre-test, post-test, and 6-months follow-up. Information on parent mental illness and family living arrangement was collected through a parent questionnaire. The data was analyzed using covariance analysis with Generalized Linear Mixed Methods. At baseline, depressive and anxiety symptoms did not differ significantly based on parent mental illness. Symptoms of depression at baseline were significantly higher for children from a higher-risk family living arrangement, but anxiety symptoms were not. Parent mental illness and family living arrangement did not moderate the effects of the program on depression and anxiety at post-test or 6-months follow-up. Parent mental illness moderated the intervention effects on negative self-esteem, an aspect of depression, at post-test, with improvements seen only for children who did not have a parent with a mental illness. The findings indicate an association between family living arrangement and depressive symptoms in children. The findings suggest that the program is effective for children regardless of parent mental illness or family living arrangement, although parent mental illness has the capacity to influence the program's outcomes.

Design: A systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines. Methods: The databases that were searched included MEDLINE, Cinahl, Cochrane Library and Science Direct. The search was limited to available full text articles in English, published between 2003 and 2013. Results: After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, seven papers were included. The review indicated the availability of some highly reliable tools that enable assessment of clinical competences in nursing education. At the same time, however, it is still not clear as to what competences nursing students must achieve during their education. Conclusions: our review showed that various tools exist for assessing clinical nursing competences. In addition, for each country it is important to compose an assessment tool, which measures actual clinical nursing competences, and means customized for their needs and based on their national guidelines. Slovenia has three academic faculties and five colleges with a nursing education program. Common standards regarding assessment of nursing competences among them would definitely lead to better practices and success of graduates and subsequently for the professionals in nursing field. What emerges from the literature is the need to move forward, to foster creativity, freedom of thought and originality and for these reasons we have to consider the possibility of developing a model for obtaining universal clinical competencies.

Parkinson Nurses (PN) may be pivotal promoting tailored care offerings. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates PD care models and aims at furnishing current concepts of PN to offer personalized care. Objective: The purpose of this study is to identify the various roles and functions that PN may hold for personalized PD care. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review, utilizing: PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO. The review qualitatively evaluated articles, which described personalized care models involving PNs and was guided by the personalized care management model. A meta-analysis compared patient-reported QoL (quantified using the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire) between personalized care interventions involving PN versus standard care with. Results: Twenty-seven publications were identified, including six randomized, controlled trials ascertaining with health related QoL (n = 1830 PwPs). The qualitative evaluation revealed that PN contribute to all aspects of personalized care. The meta-analysis showed no improved QoL in personalized care models compared to standard care, thought a great heterogeneity among study design and interventions was outlined (Standardized Mean Difference = -0.8935; 95% Confidence Interval, -2.1177 to 0.3307; z = -1.43, p = 0.1526). Conclusion: PN fulfil important functions in personalized PD care. For the future, a clear role definition will be necessary to adjust training for PN across healthcare systems and care settings but especially to realize their full potential for PD care.

Fundamental Skills for Entering Neurosurgery Residents: Report of a Pacific Region "Boot Camp'' Pilot Course, 2009	NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Education; Intern; Neurosurgery; Practical; Skills	CONTINUING MEDICAL-EDUCATION; PHYSICIAN	BACKGROUND: Incorporation of the first postgraduate year of training into neurological surgery residencies in 2009 posed new challenges to neurosurgical educators. A "boot camp'' course was held in August 2009 to introduce first year neurosurgical trainees to various fundamental cognitive and practical skills. OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of this course was evaluated by electronic survey of all trainees and faculty members. METHODS: Eighteen trainees entering 5 western neurosurgical residencies (in either the first or second postgraduate year) participated in a course taught by 10 faculty members at a single host institution (Oregon Health & Science University) for 2 days. All trainees completed an online survey evaluating the relevance and quality of each didactic and hands-on course component and answered additional questions about the goals and design of the course. Faculty members were also surveyed. RESULTS: All trainees thought the course met its goals, provided relevant and useful information and experience, and was likely to improve patient care. In particular, hands-on procedural and operative course components were highly valued. CONCLUSION: A fundamental skills boot camp course for first year neurosurgical trainees seems valuable.

The primary literature provides a rich source of data and application problems to engage students in this practice within the context of chemistry content knowledge. However, most existing classroom activities based on the literature involve reading full articles. To offer students more frequent practice, we suggest that instructors prepare assignments based on data excerpted from articles. Herein, we demonstrate the pedagogical goals, design strategy, and implementation of such assignments, using over 40 examples from our own analytical chemistry courses.

J	Chang, YH; Yan, YC; Lu, YT				Chang, Yi-Hsing; Yan, Yin-Chen; Lu, You-Te			Effects of Combining Different Collaborative Learning Strategies with Problem-Based Learning in a Flipped Classroom on Program Language Learning	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						flipped classroom; problem-based learning; collaboration learning; programming language		This study proposed combining problem-based learning (PBL) with different collaboration learning strategies in flipped classrooms to improve learners' learning motivation and learning outcomes. The main idea was to design a teaching process based on the concept of flipped classrooms. The proposed method was adopted to design learning objectives, learning content, and group activities, thereby forming new teaching strategies for developing students' independent learning, logical thinking, problem-solving skills, learning outcomes, and learning motivation. We used the C# programming language as the learning target and recruited 96 students from a first-year class of the Department of Information Management of the Southern Taiwan university of Science and Technology as participants. During the experiment, the participants were divided into an experimental group with heterogeneous subgroups and a control group with random subgroups, and pretest and posttest data obtained during the programming course were used to evaluate the learning effects of the proposed teaching strategies. In addition, a questionnaire was used to explore learning motivation through three aspects: flipped classroom, PBL, and collaborative learning. The results of this study indicated that the proposed teaching strategies improved the participants' learning outcomes. The experimental group exhibited higher improvements in learning outcomes than did the control group. Significant results were obtained for all the items of the adopted questionnaire. Thus, the participants provided positive ratings to the flipped classroom model designed in this study.

In a sub-excitable light-sensitive chemical medium, an asymmetric disturbing or excitation, causes formation of localized travelling excitation wave-fragments. When two or more wave-fragments collide, they annihilate or merge into new wave-fragment. The wave-fragments can be thought as elementary units of information and their interaction sites as a logical gates. Size and life span of a wave-fragment depends on a level of medium's illumination. By encapsulating BZ reaction into a lipid vesicle, we can manipulate the BZ-derived logical gates. By interpreting wave-fragments as values of Boolean variables, we design a collision-based polymorphic logical gate in BZ vesicles. The gate implements operation xnor for low illumination, and it acts as nor gate for high illumination.

Efficient light harvesting and photon sensing via engineered cooperative effects	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						light harvesting; photon sensors; bio-mimetic devices	QUANTUM COHERENCE; ENERGY-TRANSFER; SUPERRADIANCE; ECHOES	Efficient devices for light harvesting and photon sensing are fundamental building blocks of basic energy science and many essential technologies. Recent efforts have turned to biomimicry to design the next generation of light-capturing devices, partially fueled by an appreciation of the fantastic efficiency of the initial stages of natural photosynthetic systems at capturing photons. In such systems extended excitonic states are thought to play a fundamental functional role, inducing cooperative coherent effects, such as superabsorption of light and supertransfer of photoexcitations. Inspired by this observation, we design an artificial light-harvesting and photodetection device that maximally harnesses cooperative effects to enhance efficiency. The design relies on separating absorption and transfer processes (energetically and spatially) in order to overcome the fundamental obstacle to exploiting cooperative effects to enhance light capture: the enhanced emission processes that accompany superabsorption. This engineered separation of processes greatly improves the efficiency and the scalability of the system.

Overlapping but distinct: a new model for G-quadruplex biochemical specificity	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							NMR-SPECTROSCOPY; LOOP-LENGTH; DNA; RECOGNITION; SEQUENCE; RNA; BINDING; FLUORESCENCE; PROMOTERS; MOTIFS	G-quadruplexes are noncanonical nucleic acid structures formed by stacked guanine tetrads. They are capable of a range of functions and thought to play widespread biological roles. This diversity raises an important question: what determines the biochemical specificity of G-quadruplex structures? The answer is particularly important from the perspective of biological regulation because genomes can contain hundreds of thousands of G-quadruplexes with a range of functions. Here we analyze the specificity of each sequence in a 496-member library of variants of a reference G-quadruplex with respect to five functions. Our analysis shows that the sequence requirements of G-quadruplexes with these functions are different from one another, with some mutations altering biochemical specificity by orders of magnitude. Mutations in tetrads have larger effects than mutations in loops, and changes in specificity are correlated with changes in multimeric state. To complement our biochemical data we determined the solution structure of a monomeric G-quadruplex from the library. The stacked and accessible tetrads rationalize why monomers tend to promote a model peroxidase reaction and generate fluorescence. Our experiments support a model in which the sequence requirements of G-quadruplexes with different functions are overlapping but distinct. This has implications for biological regulation, bioinformatics, and drug design.

In the molecular connectivity paradigm, molecular structure is represented directly. Kier and Hall developed the method by creating ways to encode electronic information based on the paradigm developed from the Randic branching index. The simple and valence delta values were created to encode atomic and valence-state electronic information through counts of sigma, pi, and lone pair electrons. A family of indices was created to provide a wide range of structure information. The key aspects of the development are presented and discussed in such a way as to reveal, at least in part, the imaginative thinking involved in the process. Possible future roles for molecular connectivity chi indices are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

In the history of mathematical notation, written notation is usually considered. However, to be an effective thinking tool, notation must be properly perceived. Blind and partially sighted people run into difficulty in making, exploring and understanding mathematical concepts conceived for being represented in multi-dimensional space. In this paper, we capitalize on the multifaceted nature of digital symbols to define multimodal digital notation for graph structures that allows blind and partially sighted people to represent graph structures, reason about them and communicate their reasoning with sighted people as well as each other. As support tool for notation proposed we have designed a multimodal interactive system, in which haptic signals play a crucial role. An evolutionary prototype of the system has been developed and evaluated according to the star life cycle model. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hofmann, M; Pierce, B; Wagner, D				Hofmann, Martin; Pierce, Benjamin; Wagner, Daniel			Symmetric Lenses	ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES			English	Article						Design; Languages; Theory; lens; view-update; algebra; category theory	TRANSFORMATIONS	Lenses-bidirectional transformations between pairs of connected structures-have been extensively studied and are beginning to find their way into industrial practice. However, some aspects of their foundations remain poorly understood. In particular, most previous work has focused on the special case of asymmetric lenses, where one of the structures is taken as primary and the other is thought of as a projection, or view. A few studies have considered symmetric variants, where each structure contains information not present in the other, but these all lack the basic operation of composition. Moreover, while many domain-specific languages based on lenses have been designed, lenses have not been thoroughly explored from an algebraic perspective. We offer two contributions to the theory of lenses. First, we present a new symmetric formulation, based on complements, an old idea from the database literature. This formulation generalizes the familiar structure of asymmetric lenses, and it admits a good notion of composition. Second, we explore the algebraic structure of the space of symmetric lenses. We present generalizations of a number of known constructions on asymmetric lenses and settle some longstanding questions about their properties-in particular, we prove the existence of (symmetric monoidal) tensor products and sums and the non-existence of full categorical products or sums in the category of symmetric lenses. We then show how the methods of universal algebra can be applied to build iterator lenses for structured data such as lists and trees, yielding lenses for operations like mapping, filtering, and concatenation from first principles. Finally, we investigate an even more general technique for constructing mapping combinators, based on the theory of containers.

In a fast changing knowledge economy, 21st-century digital skills drive organizations' competitiveness and innovation capacity. Although such skills are seen as crucial, the digital aspect integrated with 21st century skills is not yet sufficiently defined. The main objectives of this study were to (1) examine the relation between 21st-century skills and digital skills; and (2) provide a framework of 21st-century digital skills with conceptual dimensions and key operational components aimed at the knowledge worker. A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize the relevant academic literature concerned with 21st-century digital skills. In total, 1592 different articles were screened from which 75 articles met the predefined inclusion criteria. The results show that 21st-century skills are broader than digital skills the list of mentioned skills is far more extensive. In addition, in contrast to digital skills, 21st-century skills are not necessarily underpinned by ICT. Furthermore, we identified seven core skills: technical, information management, communication, collaboration, creativity, critical thinking and problem solving. Five contextual skills were also identified: ethical awareness, cultural awareness, flexibility, self direction and lifelong learning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It has the potential to enhance the production, accessibility and utilisation of routine health information for clinical and service management decision-making. It is important to understand the range of definitions and concepts of data harmonisation, as well as how its various social and technical components and processes are thought to lead to better health management decision-making. However, there is lack of agreement in the literature, and in practice, on definitions and conceptualisations of data harmonisation, making it difficult for health system decision-makers and researchers to design, implement, evaluate and compare data harmonisation interventions. This scoping review aims to synthesise (1) definitions and conceptualisations of data harmonisation as well as (2) explanations in the literature of the causal relationships between data harmonisation and health management decision-making.MethodsThis review follows recommended methodological stages for scoping studies. We will identify relevant studies (peer-reviewed and grey literature) from 2000 onwards, in English only, and with no methodological restriction, in various electronic databases, such as CINAHL, MEDLINE via PubMed and Global Health. Two reviewers will independently screen records for potential inclusion for the abstract and full-text screening stages. One reviewer will do the data extraction, analysis and synthesis, with built-in reliability checks from the rest of the team. We will use a combination of sampling techniques, including two types of purposeful sampling', a methodological approach that is particularly suitable for a scoping review with our objectives. We will provide (a) a numerical synthesis of characteristics of the included studies and (b) a narrative synthesis of definitions and explanations in the literature of the relationship between data harmonisation and health management decision-making.DiscussionWe list potential limitations of this scoping review. To our knowledge, this scoping review will be the first to synthesise definitions and conceptualisations of data harmonisation in the literature as well as the underlying explanations in the literature of the causal links between data harmonisation and health management decision-making.

By doing so, it contributes to the debate on rethinking traditional project management practices and accentuates the need for adjustments based on the project context. Design/methodology/approach This paper extends the project management theory by proposing a lean project planning (LPP) and control framework, developed and tested in collaboration with ten engineer-to-order (ETO) companies. By following a design science research approach, elements from lean thinking and current project planning and control practices are combined into a maturity model (MM). Findings ETO project characteristics are identified, and their implications for planning and control are discussed. Nine enablers that transform current project planning and control approaches into a lean approach are defined, allowing the analysis of the underlying complexity of planning and controlling ETO projects and thus facilitating the determination of the actions required to improve project performance. Originality/value To the authors' best knowledge, this paper is the first to empirically examine the journey toward LPP and control from a MM perspective. This research attempts to describe the enablers of LPP and control.

J	Dong, H				Dong, Hui			Teaching Design of "Three-Dimensional" Blended Ideological and Political Courses from the Perspective of Deep Learning	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article								Since the increasing development of information technology, its integration and curriculum resources have become a new point of view in education and teaching reform. As a result, educational concepts, teaching models, and learning methods have been changed. Moreover, new requirements for the teaching reform of ideological and political courses in colleges and universities have also been put forward. Aiming at the current educational mechanism of ideological education courses in colleges and universities, which has a single form, is not well targeted and lacks synergy. This paper studies and establishes a brand-new three-dimensional hybrid education concept. The characteristics of this concept include (1) timeliness; that is, the basic views of Marxism are unified with the characteristics of the times; (2) pertinence, that is, the combination of ideological education and the characteristics of the students' growth stage; (3) openness; that is, the new curriculum content and creative thinking are connected. Therefore, the three-dimensional hybrid teaching that combines networked teaching with the traditional teacher-centered teaching model has become an inevitable trend of classroom teaching reform at this stage. This paper develops a college ideological education course recommendation system based on deep learning, based on a hybrid collaborative filtering algorithm, and by introducing the effectiveness of the gradually forgetting curve based on changes in user feature, it better solves the shortcomings of traditional collaborative filtering algorithms, such as low efficiency and weak adaptability. Further, a corresponding recommendation system for ideological guidance courses in colleges and universities has been developed. The system runs stably and has strong practicability and robustness. It is of positive significance for creating an ideological and educational atmosphere with different forms and innovation for teachers and students.

This vection onset latency is thought to represent the time required to resolve sensory conflicts between the stationary observer's visual and nonvisual information about self-motion. In this study, we investigated whether manipulations designed to increase the weight-ings assigned to vision (compared to the nonvisual senses) might reduce vection onset latency. We presented two different types of visual priming displays directly before our main vection-inducing displays: (1) 'random motion' priming displays - designed to pre-activate general, as opposed to self-motion-specific, visual motion processing systems; and (2) 'dynamic no-motion' priming dis-plays - designed to stimulate vision, but not generate conscious motion perceptions. Prior exposure to both types of priming displays was found to significantly shorten vection onset latencies for the main self-motion display. These experiments show that vection onset latencies can be reduced by pre-activating the visual system with both types of priming display.

Narratives of creativity: How eight teachers on four school levels integrate creativity into teaching and learning	THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY			English	Article						Creativity; Teaching for creativity; Creative learning; Framing; Action research		Modern societies prioritise creative thinking and the capacity to actualize ideas. Creativity is one of six fundamental ideals' in the Icelandic curricula presented by educational authorities in Icelandic in 2011. These curricula were designed for the three first school levels preschool, compulsory school (6-16 years old), and upper secondary school (16-20 years old) -with the common aim of enhancing core competencies built on the six fundamental ideals for students (Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, 2011). This paper describes an action research project that ran from autumn 2013 until autumn 2015.1, the author of this article describe and anlayse our work on behalf of and in collaboration with the other participants. With it, we sought to understand how we as teachers could work to enhance student creativity. Participants included eight teachers at four school levels working in a research group led by the author. Data included journals, reflective notes, teaching plans, photographs, student information and research group meetings. Bernstein's (2000) concepts of framing and classification were used to locate teachers' work with students. Through the research process, we became more aware of their roles in nurturing student creativity. Constraints and supportive elements of creative work were identified. The main theme that emerged was: control in learning spaces. Other connected themes were: supporting student agency, experimenting with framing, engagement and personal interpretation, challenging ingrained patterns of learners as receivers, finding balance between freedom and control, and professional development through action research. Fostering creativity turned out to be a complex endeavor, characterized by several factors that can be adjusted and influenced. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Watt, SJ; Bradshaw, MF				Watt, SJ; Bradshaw, MF			Binocular cues are important in controlling the grasp but not the reach in natural prehension movements	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						binocular vision; monocular vision; stereopsis; reaching and grasping; prehension	VISUAL FORM AGNOSIA; KINEMATIC ANALYSIS; HAND ACTION; PERCEPTION; ACCURACY; TRANSPORT; DISTANCE; OBJECTS; CORTEX; VISION	Binocular cues are typically considered to be pre-eminent in the control of reaching and grasping behaviour. However, in the absence of such information prehension movements can still be accurate and reliable. The present study therefore was designed to assess further the contribution of binocular information in the control of human reaching and grasping movements. Participants reached for and picked up objects under binocular and monocular viewing, both in the absence of a visible scene around the target objects (complete darkness with 'self-illuminated' objects and hand), and under normal (fully illuminated) viewing. Analysis of kinematic parameters indicated that the removal of binocular information did not significantly affect the major indices of the transport component, although it did affect the grasp component. In contrast, the kinematic parameters in the unlit conditions revealed that both the transport component and the grasp component of the reach were severely disrupted whether binocular cues were available or not. Our results suggest that binocular information may be more important for the control of grasp formation than for the control of the transport component. Elimination of the surrounding scene and normal visual feedback affects both the transport and the grasp. It is concluded that in normal viewing conditions, reaching and grasping movements are less dependent on binocular information than has previously been thought. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Real-time data collection for pain: Appraisal and current status	PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article						real-time data capture; EMA; assessment	RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; ELECTRONIC DIARY; RECALL; EXPERIENCE; DURATION; MEMORY; IMPACT; MOOD	Objective. Real-time data capture (RTDC) techniques have rapidly developed with the advent of computer and information technology. We plan to discuss the use of RTDC in the assessment of pain, including issues pertaining to its rationale, sampling protocols, and our opinion on the current status of the methodology. Design. This is "thought" piece involving no systematic data collection methods. Results. We described the rationale for using RTDC, including issues in recall bias, the desire for detailed information about pain, and the ability to examine within-person associations between pain and other variables. The mechanics of RTDC implementations were discussed with a focus on sampling protocols and data collection methods. The final section concerned the status of RTDC. Current acceptance of RTDC is evaluated and three issues in the science of RTDC were discussed: the interpretation of differences between recall and the average of momentary assessments for the same period; if RTDC is advancing our understanding of pain; and, the issue of what consumers of pain assessments actually desire. RTDC extensions to feedback based on momentary assessments are also discussed. Conclusion. Real-time data collection can be a useful methodology for improving our understanding of pain and especially of its dynamic nature in real-world settings.

Studies have shown this is due to insufficient cognition of the structural relationship between data and events. Shili Theory is an attractive concept. To embed intelligent agricultural technology in events and the natural environment, especially to unify and standardize agricultural production data, firstly, this paper has defined the concept of Shili Theory which researches the natural regularity of the event by Shili Mirrored Structure. Secondly, this paper has proposed a Shili Mirrored Structure based on the technology development path (from the human brain memory mechanism to the information storage mechanism to intelligent technology). Finally, the structure has been applied to develop an intelligent system of agricultural production data management. In rice production of Jilin Province, it forms the event chain of the whole plant 5T (seed, seeding, paddy shoot, grain, product period operation) and grain period 5T (harvesting, field stacking, drying, warehousing, storing). The system application shows that this management structure can reduce data flow, improve data utilization, and enhance the correlation between data and events. It can realize the quality improvement of the agricultural production process, especially revealing the 8.83% significant latent loss in rice harvest.

Slipping through the net: the paradox of nursing's electronic theses and dissertations	INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW			English	Article						Dissemination; Electronic Theses and Dissertations; International Network; Nursing Research; Research Evidence; United Kingdom; United States		Aim: The study's main aim was to gain in-depth understanding of how nurse scholars engage with electronic theses and dissertations. Through elicitation of opinions about challenges and opportunities, and perceptions of future development, the study also aimed to influence the design of a new international web-based forum for learning and sharing information on this topic. Background: Electronic theses and dissertations provide an opportunity to radically change the way in which graduate student research is presented, disseminated and used internationally. However, as revealed by a multi-national survey in 2011, many nurse scholars in vanguard universities have little awareness of how to find and exploit this ever-expanding global knowledge resource that is increasingly available free in full text format. Within this context more detailed understandings of nurse scholars' thinking and actions are required. Methods: A qualitative approach using a semi-structured interview guide was utilized to elicit perceptions from 14 nurse scholars. Results: Thematic analysis of the interviewees' responses identified six major themes: initial exposure and effect; searching; accessing; handling; using; and evaluation. Insights were gained about the value of these resources and behaviours in using them as exemplars for structure, format and methodology. Conclusion and implications for nursing and nursing policy: Despite the small study size, the findings added valuable new insights to the overview gained from the 2011 survey. These have been used to inform development of a new global initiative: the International Network for Electronic Theses and Dissertations in Nursing. Featuring an educational website (www.inetdin.net), this initiative aims to support and challengenursing's policy makers, practitioners and especially educators to utilize this neglected but exponentially increasing wellspring of international nursing knowledge.

Laparoscopic adrenalectomy has become the standard operation for adrenal tumors at present. Aim: To assess whether laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) can be used for obese patients with adrenal tumor. Material and methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Science databases and Cochrane Library, and the search time is up to January 2022. We used STATA 16.0 and RevMan 5.4 software for data processing and statistical analysis. Results: Eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis results showed that compared with the nonobese group, the obese group had a significantly longer operation time (OT) (weighted mean difference (WMD): -10.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): -19.16 to 0.87, p = 0.03). It also had higher estimated blood loss (WMD: -13.15, 95% CI: -35.92 to 9.63, p = 0.26) and conversion rate (odds ratio (OR): 0.70, 95% CI: 1.31 to 1.60, p = 0.40), longer length of hospital stay (LOS) (WMD: -0.04, 95% CI: -0.47 to 0.39, p = 0.86), and a higher number of complications (odds ratio (OR) = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.02, p = 0.06), but these differences were not statistically significant. Additionally, in subgroup analysis longer OT (p = 0.0001) and LOS (p = 0.007) were associated with retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy for obesity. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that LA is feasible and effective in patients with obesity.
