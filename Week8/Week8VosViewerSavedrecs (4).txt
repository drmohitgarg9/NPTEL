A methodological example using the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit Comfort Questionnaire	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						cognitive interviewing; comfort questionnaire; epilepsy monitoring unit; face validity; instrument development; nursing; qualitative method; question-and-answer model; questionnaire design; questionnaire pre-testing	TASK-FORCE; CULTURAL-ADAPTATION; PRO INSTRUMENTS; TRANSLATION; GUIDELINES; SAFETY	Aims To identify problematic items, assess completeness and user-friendliness, and undertake modifications to enhance face validity of the newly developed Epilepsy Monitoring Unit Comfort Questionnaire. Design Qualitative-descriptive cross-sectional study. Methods Five iterative rounds of cognitive interviewing were conducted with members of the target population between July - November 2017. Think-aloud technique, verbal probing, and observation were used, to assess how respondents understood and answered questions. Data analysis was based on the framework method; an eight-column framework matrix was created for this purpose. Results In 25 interviews, problems regarding completeness of the item pool, comprehension of items, retrieval of information, judgment while finding answers and reporting the appropriate responses could be detected. According to the results, 27 items remained unchanged, 11 items were reworded, and six items were added. Instructions section of the questionnaire was reworked, too. Conclusion Although time-consuming, cognitive interviewing turned out to be a valuable approach for revealing problems in an instrument, which would, otherwise, remain undetected and threaten validity.

J	Persson, E; Andersson, D; Koppel, L; Västfjäll, D; Tinghög, G				Persson, Emil; Andersson, David; Koppel, Lina; Vastfjall, Daniel; Tinghog, Gustav			A preregistered replication of motivated numeracy	COGNITION			English	Article						Motivated numeracy; Motivated reasoning; Identity-protective cognition; Replication	SCIENCE LITERACY; COGNITION; BELIEFS	Motivated numeracy refers to the idea that people with high reasoning capacity will use that capacity selectively to process information in a manner that protects their own valued beliefs. This concept was introduced in a now classic article by Kahan, Peters, Dawson, & Slovic [2017, Behavioral Public Policy 1, 54-86], who used numeracy to index reasoning capacity, and demonstrated that the tendency to engage in ideologically congruent interpretation of facts increased substantially with people's numeracy. Despite the importance of this finding, both from a theoretical and practical point of view, there is yet no consensus in the literature about the factual strength of motivated numeracy. We therefore conducted a large-scale replication of Kahan, Peters, Dawson, and Slovic (2017), using a pre-specified analysis plan with strict evaluation criteria. We did not find good evidence for motivated numeracy; there are distinct patterns in our data at odds with the core predictions of the theory, most notably (i) there is ideologically congruent responding that is not moderated by numeracy, and (ii) when there is moderation, ideologically congruent responding occurs only at the highest levels of numeracy. Our findings suggest that the cumulative evidence for motivated numeracy is weaker than previously thought, and that caution is warranted when this feature of human cognition is leveraged to improve science communication on contested topics such as climate change or immigration.

The objective of this article is to review the literature on A.I.S.A. to identify its obstacles, challenges, and solution to close its gaps. The methodology identified the critical factors of system monitoring and defines search suitability to obtain 55 documents. With the results, a qualitative analysis is conducted on the mentioned axes, which is complemented with the text mining software Vantage Point V 15.1 to observe in graphical form the most relevant aspects. Within the conclusions is a constant demand from actors for access to information, and knowledge in the training processes, it is recommended in this regard the additional skills for innovation and participation in concerted practices. As regards the limitations of agricultural innovation processes, it suggests the involvement of cooperatives, technological platforms, and farmers' organizations as intermediaries relevant to closing gaps. With regard to sustainability, A.I.S. thinking is recommended for an inclusive dialogue among actors and to facilitate sustainability transitions. Finally, to address the socio-technical and ethical challenges of access to technologies and technological transition, it is recommended to design appropriate policies for access to resources and the development of markets that enhance business opportunities and the development of sustainable innovations.

J	Dransch, D				Dransch, D			The use of different media in visualizing spatial data	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						multimedia; visualization; media function; communication; cognition		Multimedia technology changes the visualization of spatial data. The map, the traditional presentation of spatial data, is complemented by other media like pictures, animation, sound and video. Each of these additional media has particular abilities to communicate information. For instance some media are suitable to give a vivid picture about a phenomenon and others, on the contrary, are efficient to mediate the idea of spatial concepts. The selection and combination of different media for data visualization in cartography and geosciences have to be guided by two different aspects: by the particular function a medium has to fulfil in a multimedia presentation and by the application context. The functions of media can be derived from human cognition process and from communication purpose. Cognition process explains how media may support perception and cognition. Communication purpose determines what type of media are suitable. The application context of a multimedia presentation is either visual thinking, the graphical exploration or verification of spatial data by an expert or visual communication, the demonstration of spatial data for non-experts. In the first case media have to assist the scientist in finding questions from unstructured data sets and in verifying a derived hypothesis; in the second case media have to present information in a way that people without great knowledge of a subject can perceive and understand that subject. The media design for visual thinking and visual communication have to regard the media functions which were derived from cognition process and communication purpose. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A functional MRI study on how oxytocin affects decision making in social dilemmas: Cooperate as long as it pays off, aggress only when you think you can win	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Oxytocin; Social decision making; Functional neuroimaging; Social dilemmas; Anti-coordination game; Coordination game; Facial cues	INTRANASAL OXYTOCIN; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; NEURAL CIRCUITRY; AMYGDALA; BRAIN; RESPONSES; HUMANS; FACES; FEAR; HIPPOCAMPAL	We investigate if the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT), known to moderate social behaviour, influences strategic decision making in social dilemmas by facilitating the integration of incentives and social cues. Participants (N = 29) played two economic games with different incentive structures in the fMRI scanner after receiving OT or placebo (following a double blind, within-subject design). Pictures of angry or neutral faces (the social cues) were displayed alongside the game matrices. Consistent with a priori hypotheses based on the modulatory role of OT in mesolimbic dopaminergic brain regions, the results indicate that, compared to placebo, OT significantly increases the activation of the nucleus accumbens during an assurance (coordination) game that rewards mutual cooperation. This increases appetitive motivation so that cooperative behaviour is facilitated for risk averse individuals. OT also significantly attenuates the amygdala, thereby reducing the orienting response to social cues. The corresponding change in behaviour is only apparent in the chicken (or anti-coordination) game, where aggression is incentivized but fatal if the partner also aggresses. Because of this ambiguity, decision making can be improved by additional information, and OT steers decisions in the chicken game in accordance with the valence of the facial cue: aggress when face is neutral; retreat when it is angry. Through its combined influence on amygdala and nucleus accumbens, OT improves the selection of a cooperative or aggressive strategy in function of the best match between the incentives of the game and the social cues present in the decision environment.

J	Caplan, S; Kodner, J; Yang, C				Caplan, Spencer; Kodner, Jordan; Yang, Charles			Miller's monkey updated: Communicative efficiency and the statistics of words in natural language	COGNITION			English	Article						Words; Computational modeling; Communication; Information theory	NEIGHBORHOOD ACTIVATION; LEXICAL ACCESS; ZIPFS LAW; PHONOTACTICS; SEGMENTATION; CONSTRAINTS; EMERGENCE; ENTROPY; DENSITY	Is language designed for communicative and functional efficiency? G. K. Zipf famously argued that shorter words are more frequent because they are easier to use, thereby resulting in the statistical law that bears his name. Yet, G. A. Miller showed that even a monkey randomly typing at a keyboard, and intermittently striking the space bar, would generate "words" with similar statistical properties. Recent quantitative analyses of human language lexicons (Piantadosi et al., 2012) have revived Zipf's functionalist hypothesis. Ambiguous words tend to be short, frequent, and easy to articulate in language production. Such statistical findings are commonly interpreted as evidence for pressure for efficiency, as the context of language use often provides cues to overcome lexical ambiguity. In this study, we update Miller's monkey thought experiment to incorporate empirically motivated phonological and semantic constraints on the creation of words. We claim that the appearance of communicative efficiency is a spandrel (Gould & Lewontin, 1979), as lexicons formed without the context of language use or reference to communication or efficiency exhibit comparable statistical properties. Furthermore, the updated monkey model provides a good fit for the growth trajectory of English as recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary. Focusing on the history of English words since 1900, we show that lexicons resulting from the monkey model provide a better embodiment of communicative efficiency than the actual lexicon of English. We conclude by arguing for the need to go beyond correlational statistics and to seek direct evidence for the mechanisms that underlie principles of language design.

Pre-service teachers in the third year of their studies were faced with the design of tasks to be included in Math Trails for primary school students. The study analyzes, from a quantitative approach, 117 tasks contained in 11 Math Trails. The analysis was performed on the basis of classification variables (grade, mathematical content and object or real element involved in every task) and research variables which provide information about the nature of the tasks (procedural vs. problem-solving, level of cognitive demand, degree of contextualization, openness and creativity). Additionally, relationships between the different categories of analysis have been studied. The results reveal certain biases in the tasks in relation to the contents addressed (an abundance of tasks with a geometric component and a scarcity of tasks involving algebra or probability concepts). Most of the tasks are presented in a real context. However, a higher percentage of procedural tasks than problem-solving tasks is observed, with a predominance of low openness, creativity and cognitive demand. These results provide useful lines of work to address difficulties faced by future teachers in the STEAM field.

We aimed to create an informative, scientifically accurate and engaging website to educate patients about acupuncture for back pain and modify their beliefs in a way that might enhance its clinical effects. Methods: We used psychological theory and techniques to design an evidence-based website, incorporating multimedia elements. We conducted qualitative "think aloud" audio-recorded interviews to elicit user views of the website. A convenience sample of ten participants (4 male; aged 21-64 years from the local community) looked at the website in the presence of a researcher and spoke their thoughts out loud. Comments were categorised by topic. Results: The website comprises 11 main pages and addresses key topics of interest to potential acupuncture patients, including beneficial and adverse effects, mechanisms of action, safety, practicalities, and patients' experiences of acupuncture. It provides information through text, evidence summaries and audio-clips of four patients' stories and two acupuncturists' descriptions of their practice, and three short films. Evidence from the think aloud study was used to identify opportunities to make the website more informative, engaging, and user-friendly. Conclusions: Using a combination of psychological theory and qualitative interviews enabled us to produce a user-friendly, evidence-based website that is likely to change patients' beliefs about acupuncture for back pain. Before using the website in clinical settings it is necessary to test its effects on key outcomes including patients' beliefs and capacity for making informed choices about acupuncture.

To address these challenges the UK Government and the construction industry have been promoting modular construction; a method that can improve efficiency and productivity in the construction sector via the prefabrication of volumetric elements or structural components of a building off-site and their assembly on-site. In this study we highlight that while modular construction can help deliver sustainability credentials in the entire construction value chain, at present the sector's activities are concentrated on using modular construction to improve resource efficiency upstream of the construction value chain, i.e. at the design, manufacture and construction. This appears to be divorced from the need to promote resource efficiency and productivity at the stages occurring downstream (i.e., disassembly and end-of-life management) of the construction value chain. Such divergence could hamper construction industry's efforts to reduce its environmental and economic impacts in the future, and points to the need of an integrated, holistic approach to improving the sustainability of the sector. To support our argument, we provide an overview of the current state of modular construction in the UK, and outline key obstacles in rolling out modular construction's mainstream use. We posit that modular construction presents an opportunity to integrate upstream with downstream construction practices and achieve sustainability in the entire construction sector, and suggest that the development of a digitally enabled modular construction, whereby smart technologies are combined with modular construction, could be instrumental in supporting this vision. A smart, modular construction regime can operationalise the collection and storage of components' lifecycle information, and help the sector build the capabilities needed to support the maintenance, recovery and reuse of modular components, and reduction of waste. For this to take precedence it is imperative to think of the 'end' right at the beginning of the design stage, and foster an improved collaboration between all stakeholders involved in the construction value chain.

A qualitative study exploring individuals' beliefs and experiences of Achilles tendinopathy	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FEAR-AVOIDANCE BELIEFS; CHRONIC MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN; INTERPRETIVE DESCRIPTION; FOLLOW-UP; PEOPLE; INTERVIEWS; OUTCOMES; MODEL; STATE	Background Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a common and often persistent musculoskeletal disorder affecting both athletic and non-athletic populations. Despite the relatively high incidence there is little insight into the impact and perceptions of tendinopathy from the individual's perspective. Increased awareness of the impact and perceptions around individuals' experiences with Achilles tendinopathy may provide crucial insights for the management of what is often a complex, persistent, and disabling MSK disorder. Purpose To qualitatively explore the lived experiences of individuals with AT. Design A qualitative, interpretive description design was performed using semi-structured telephone interviews. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted on 15 participants (8 male and 7 female) with AT. Thematic analysis was performed using the guidelines laid out by Braun and Clarke. The study has been reported in accordance with the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist. Results Four main themes were identified from the data: 1) beliefs and perceptions surrounding AT: "If I'm over training or something, I don't really know", 2) the biopsychosocial impact of AT: "I think it restricts me in a lot of things that I would be able to do", 3) individuals' experiences with the management process: "You want it to happen now. You're doing all this stuff and it's just very slow progress", and 4) future prognosis and outlook in individuals with AT: "I see myself better". Conclusions This study offers a unique insight into the profound impact and consequences of Achilles tendinopathy in a mixed sample of both athletic and non-athletic individuals. The findings of this study have important clinical implications. Specifically, it highlights the need for clinicians to recognize and adopt treatment approaches to embrace a more biopsychosocial approach for the management of tendinopathy.

Atraumatic versus traumatic lumbar puncture needles: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							SPINAL NEEDLES; TRIAL	Introduction: Lumbar puncture is one of the oldest and most commonly performed procedures in medicine, used to diagnose and treat disease. Headache following lumbar puncture remains a frequent complication, causing significant patient discomfort and often requiring narcotic analgesia or invasive therapy. Needle tip design has been proposed to affect the incidence of headache postlumbar puncture, with pencil-point `atraumatic' needles thought to reduce its incidence in comparison to bevelled `traumatic' needles. Despite this, the use of atraumatic needles and knowledge of their existence remains significantly limited among clinicians. This study will systematically review the evidence on atraumatic lumbar puncture needles and compare them with traumatic needles across a variety of clinical outcomes. Methods and analyses: We will include published randomised controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies and abstracts, with no publication type or language restrictions. Search strategies will be designed to peruse the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials. gov, CINAHL, WHO Clinical Trials Database and Cochrane Library databases. We will also implement strategies to search the grey literature. 3 reviewers will thoroughly and independently examine the search results, complete data abstraction and conduct quality assessment. Included RCTs will be assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool and eligible observational studies will be examined using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We will examine the outcomes of: headache and its type, intensity, duration and treatment; backache; success rate; hearing disturbance and nerve root irritation. The primary outcome will be the incidence of postdural puncture headache. We will calculate pooled estimates, relative risks for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes, with corresponding 95% CIs. Statistical heterogeneity will be measured using Cochran's Q test and quantified using the I-2 statistic. We will also conduct prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses to examine if covariates exist and to explore potential heterogeneity. Ethics and dissemination: Research ethics board approval is not required for this study as it draws from published data and raises no concerns related to patient privacy. This review will provide a comprehensive assessment of the evidence on atraumatic needles for lumbar puncture and is directed to a wide audience. Results from the review will be disseminated extensively through conferences and submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.

Evaluation of a Teacher-Training Experience in Spain	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						environmental education; sustainability; teacher training; climate change; role play	EDUCATION; STUDENTS; SCIENCE	The main objective of this study was to design and evaluate an experience for future teachers focused on the participatory search for sustainability through role play so that outcomes related to improving the way they see the world and their commitment to mitigate climate change could be analysed. The study was carried out with a socio-critical focus, using a qualitative approach. To this effect, semi-open interviews were conducted, and their results were codified and studied using content analysis. The outcomes show that this type of educational experience can contribute to improving commitment to climate change and new, more sustainable ways of understanding the world-starting with improving the training of free-thinking, discerning people who are able to use information and collaborate in solving socio-environmental problems. Proposals based on participatory and experiential learning, fostering ethical considerations and the training of people who are more critical and discerning, should be the basis of new models of Environmental Education for Sustainability that seek to educate a society capable of addressing present and future socio-environmental challenges.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between personality characteristics such as empathy, the tendency to implement cognitive mechanisms aimed at moral disengagement, and the use of social media. PARTICIPANTS: Italian students from first to fifth year in high school classes (n = 264). METHODS: A questionnaire was used to gather information on the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants, their use of social media, their level of empathy (Basic Empathy Scale, BES), and mechanisms of moral disengagement (Moral Disengagement Scale MDS). Two questions were included to determine whether each participant had ever been a victim of or witness to cyberbullying. RESULTS: Results suggest that offensive behaviors are related to mechanisms of moral disengagement and to interaction using forms of communication that allow anonymity. In addition, offensive behavior appears to be related to forms of Internet addiction, while prosocial behavior is linked with cognitive empathy. CONCLUSION: In order to promote the establishment of prosocial behavior, it would seem necessary for the various players involved - schools, parents, social network developers - to make an effort to implement educational environments and virtual social networks based on a hypothesis of "design for reflection", educating young people about the need to take the time to understand their feelings and relationships expressed via social media.

J	Johnson, RP				Johnson, RP			Resistance of stud shear connectors to fatigue	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH			English	Article						fatigue; shear connectors; composite beams; eurocode 4		The three relationships that have been proposed for use in design for fatigue of shear connectors in composite beams are compared, with reference to all relevant test data on welded stud connectors. Statistical analyses of these data are presented. The wide range of values found in research for the exponent m, in the usual expression for the fatigue endurance, is due not just to differences in the test methods used, but more notably, to two schools of thought on how the results should be analysed. A recommendation is made on this important question, which does not appear to have been considered before. Background information and comment are provided on the relevant clause of the draft Eurocode for composite bridges, relevant to its conversion into EN 1994-2. The resistance formulae now proposed are inconsistent with that in the British Bridge Code to an extent sufficient to influence practice, especially assessment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Up to now, research has mainly focused on the evaluation of webpages, while the evaluation of SERPs received less attention. Furthermore, task complexity is often not taken into account. A within-subjects design was used to study the influence of task complexity on search query formulation, evaluation of search results, and task performance. Three search tasks were used: a fact-finding, cause-effect, and a controversial topic task. To measure perceptual search processes, we used a combination of log files, eye-tracking data, answer forms, and think-aloud protocols. The results reveal that an increase in task complexity results in more search queries and used keywords, more time to formulate search queries, and more considered search results on the SERPs. Furthermore, higher ranked search results were considered more often than lower ranked results. However, not all the results for the most complex task were in line with expectations. These conflicting results can be explained by a lack of prior knowledge and the possible interference of prior attitudes.

This article integrates skill development activities targeting civic scientific literacy skills in a nonscience majors (liberal arts) biochemistry course, but similar principles could be integrated into nursing and major levels biochemistry courses. Strategies include teaching information acquisition, source analysis argument analysis, and civic engagement. These can be integrated into classroom activities, homework assignments, and outside of class projects. The impact of these activities was assessed through performance on the activities, open ended exam questions, and an end of course survey. Students gained both biochemical content and skills in evaluating claims with evidence, and reported the course helped them better understand what scientists do and how to make decisions based upon scientific evidence without detracting from the typical content learning goals of the course.

J	Pearson, I				Pearson, Ian			The new dark age - A view from a futurologist	JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK			English	Editorial Material								There is much concern among scientists and engineers that we are heading towards another dark age. I believe this concern is justified. There are several contributory trends - the anti-science attitude shared by many people, increasing emphasis on freedom of expression at the expense of intellectual rigour, increasing subscription to New Age ideas, 21st century piety (a mixture of practices that appears to be a religion substitute), the dawning of 'the age of magic', and, more surprisingly, the spread of the net, and more specifically, the growth of importance of Wikipedia and its derivatives. In this age, knowledge that has been carefully accumulated over millennia will be gradually displaced in the minds of much of the population by rumour, conspiracy theory, misunderstanding, wishful thinking, political correctness and simple nonsense. It is ironic that the very tools designed to share information between scientists might contribute to the rise of the dark age, but that is exactly what we are likely to see.				ian.d.pearson@bt.com							0	1	1	0	7	THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK	KENT	PUBLICATIONS OFFICE 2A SOUTH GIPSY ROAD WELLING, KENT DA16 1JB, ENGLAND	1477-4739			J COMMUN NETW-UK	J.

To describe how this knowledge informed the development of the multimedia websites. Design Qualitative study comprising two rounds of interviews or focus groups, with thematic analysis of interview transcripts. Participants Sixty-two people (21 children and young people with long-term health conditions, 24 parents and 17 professionals). Setting One UK children's hospital and one UK Young Persons' Advisory Group. Results When asked what was important in deciding whether to join a trial, children, young people and parents prioritised information about what participation would involve, what the trial was testing, potential benefits and risks of participation and knowing they could leave the trial if they later changed their minds. Young people and parents trusted trial teams to follow regulatory and quality requirements and therefore did not think such information was a priority for the websites, although logos of trusted organisations could lend credibility. Professionals largely concurred with these views. Children and young people advised on the importance of designing the multimedia website to ensure its appearance, tone and wording suited the intended audience and on using animated characters to facilitate children's engagement. Conclusions Our study provides insights into the information that families value when deciding about healthcare trial participation. It provides guidance on the design of information resources to appeal to children and young people, while also being acceptable to parents and professionals who are often gatekeepers of children's access to information. Our findings will be of use to others developing similar multimedia websites.

J	Idoga, PE; Toycan, M; Nadiri, H; Çelebi, E				Idoga, Patience E.; Toycan, Mehmet; Nadiri, Halil; Celebi, Erbug			Factors Affecting the Successful Adoption of e-Health Cloud Based Health System From Healthcare Consumers' Perspective	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Behavioral intention; cloud; e-health; Nigeria; remote access	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; USER ACCEPTANCE; UNIFIED THEORY; FRAMEWORK; MODELS	Cloud computing in healthcare has witnessed a major development in recent years due to its remote access capabilities among others. Studies have shown that it has attracted great attention in the field of healthcare. However, research studies show a number of healthcare consumers are yet to accept the technology, especially in developing countries due to reasons, such as the data security and the improper utilization of available information and communication technologies (ICTs) in healthcare. This paper therefore aims to identify factors affecting healthcare consumers' attitude toward the adoption of the cloud-based health center. Questionnaires were administered to 465 respondents in four locations in Benue, Nigeria with 76.9% response rate. The analysis of the data was conducted with statistical package for social science (20.0), factor analysis, and LISREL (9.30), was used to determine the structural path model. Using the social technical design approach, we developed the cloud-based health center which will provide access to healthcare services remotely to rural communities and reduce the cost/time of medical healthcare delivery when implemented into the Nigerian healthcare system. The results show that performance expectancy (beta = 0.31 and t = 5.80), effort expectancy (beta = 0.19 and t = 3.90), social influence (beta = 0.21 and t = 3.95), facilitating conditions (beta = 0.22 and t = 4.82), data security (beta = 0.15 and t = 3.07), and information sharing (beta = 0.11 and t = 2.53) had a significant impact on the behavioral intention of healthcare consumers. However, cloud-based health knowledge (beta = 0.09 and t = 1.49) was found to be statistically not significant. With these findings, healthcare policy makers must think carefully before the implementation of cloud-based health center. Otherwise, the integration will continue to create a challenge.

J	Levitt, M				Levitt, M			Let the consumer decide? The regulation of commercial genetic testing	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article						genetic tests; European; commercialisation		Objectives- The development of predictive genetic tests provides a new area where consumers can gain knowledge of their health status and commercial opportunities. "Over-the-counter" or mail order genetic tests are most likely to provide information on carrier status or the risk of developing a multifactorial disease. The paper considers the social and ethical implications of individuals purchasing genetic tests and whether genetic information is different from other types of health information which individuals can obtain for themselves. Design- The discussion is illustrated by findings from a questionnaire survey of university students as potential consumers. Topics covered included what health tests they had already used, expectations of genetic tests, willingness to pay, who should have access to the results and whether there need to be restrictions on such tests. Sample-Six hundred and fifteen first-year students in the universities of Leuven, Cardiff, Central Lancashire, Vienna and Nijmegen studying either medicine or a non-science subject. Results-Students were enthusiastic about genetic tests and had high expectations of their accuracy and usefulness but most thought they should be available through the health service and a minority thought that some tests, for example for sex selection, should not be available at all. There were few differences in responses by sex or subject of study but some by country. The paper also considers ethical and social issues outside the scope of a questionnaire survey of this type. Conclusion-To address some of these issues the sale of genetic tests to individuals can be made subject to ethical guidelines or codes of practice for example to protect vulnerable groups, but there are fundamental social and ethical questions which such guidelines cannot address.

As a result, more and more information technology companies develop Internet of Things (IoT) services for this job. However, most IoT services are screened out of the market because lacking design thinking. Therefore, including users' desires in IoT products and services is a critical determinant for their survival in this permanently changing market. Thus, this study proposed a systematic framework to identify the users' desires from different stakeholders to determine technological development. For this, we use the evaluation grid method (EGM) to explore the users' desires by a series of in-depth interviews and visualize the user's response as a hierarchical evaluation map of attraction. After that, an IoT prototype is built and used to capture the insightful feedback of respondents. Meanwhile, we adopt the minimum viable product (MVP) design principles to develop two prototypes that manage a wastewater treatment plant and household environment. Overall, this study proposes an applicable user integration procedure to help IT engineers develop the IoT for sustainable service. This study also confirms that the MVP method can help to accelerate user integration. We propose a service-oriented IoT architecture in technology development and develop a decision-making service of human dispatch in operating environmental facilities and a context-awareness service for environmental control.

J	Wang, HQ				Wang, HQ			LearnOOP: An active agent-based educational system	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article							INFORMATION-SYSTEMS	Computer-based learning systems have become increasingly important. However such self-study systems still lack the aspect of a real-life classroom and suffer due to their passive nature. They are often dull and plodding. This paper describes the LearnOOP, an active distance learning system for learning object-oriented programming. LearnOOP has several features: (1) active, i.e. the system is like a human teacher who monitors the student's activities and gives guidance when necessary, (2) (3) collaborative and co-operative, i.e. there are facilities for students and teachers to collaborate and co-operate with each other: In this paper, a powerful conceptual framework has been presented using a knowledge representation language, Telos, to facilitate the formal thinking about the tools and techniques used in designing, developing and using co-operative computer-based learning systems. The architecture of LearnOOP consists of three layers, the educational agent layer the knowledge server layer and the repository layer. By deploying repository technology, the architecture provides a means for multiple intelligent educational agents to conduct active interactions between students and the system, between students and teachers and among students. The LearnOOP prototype demonstrates the need for multiple illustrates the feasibility for practical future design and deployment of such systems. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The approach, OceanViz, focuses on communicating scientific data to non-scientific audiences to foster dialogue, offering experimental, immersive approaches to visualizing complex ecosystems whilst avoiding information overload. Within the context of ecosystem-based fisheries management, OceanViz can engage decision makers into the implicit operation of scientific software as an aid during the decision process, and it can be of direct use for public communication through appealing and informative visualizations. Beside a server-client architecture to centralize decision making around an ecosystem model, OceanViz includes an extensive visualization toolkit capable of accurately reflecting marine ecosystem changes through a simulated three-dimensional (3D) underwater environment. Here we outline the ideas and concepts that went into OceanViz, its implementation and its related challenges. We reflect on challenges to scientific visualization and communication as food-for-thought for the marine ecosystem modeling community and beyond.

J	Harding, T; Oetzel, J				Harding, Truely; Oetzel, John			Implementation effectiveness of health interventions for indigenous communities: a systematic review	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Review						Indigenous communities; Health interventions; Non-communicable diseases; Implementation framework; Community engagement	DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM; PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; KNOWLEDGE-TRANSLATION; NEW-ZEALAND; CARE; OUTCOMES; SCIENCE; CULTURE; WORKERS; DISPARITIES	Background Translating research into practice is an important issue for implementing health interventions effectively for Indigenous communities. He Pikinga Waiora (HPW) is a recent implementation framework that provides a strong foundation for designing and implementing health interventions in Indigenous communities for non-communicable diseases around community engagement, culture-centred approach, systems thinking and integrated knowledge translation. This study addresses the following research question: How are the elements of the HPW Implementation Framework reflected in studies involving the implementation of a non-communicable disease health intervention in an Indigenous community? Methods A systematic review was conducted using multiple databases. Studies were included if they involved the implementation or evaluation of a health intervention targeting non-communicable diseases for Indigenous communities in Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the United States of America. Published quantitative and qualitative literature from 2008 to 2018 were included. Methodological appraisal of the included articles was completed using the Joanna Briggs Institute System for the Unified Management, Assessment and Review of Information. Data on the population, topic, methods, and outcomes were detailed for each individual study. Key data extracted included the HPW elements along with study characteristics, who delivered the intervention and health outcomes. Data analysis involved a qualitative synthesis of findings as guided by a coding scheme of the HPW elements. Results Twenty-one studies were included. Health topics included diabetes, nutrition, weight loss, cancer and general health. The key themes were as follows: (a) two thirds of studies demonstrated high levels of community engagement; (b) from the culture-centred approach, two-thirds of studies reflected moderate to high levels of community voice/agency although only a third of the studies included structural changes and researcher reflexivity; (c) about a quarter of studies included multi-level outcomes and activities consistent with systems thinking, 40% had individual-level outcomes with some systems thinking, and 33% included individual-level outcomes and limited systems thinking; and (d) almost 40% of studies included high levels of end user (e.g., policy makers and tribal leaders) engagement reflective of integrated knowledge translation, but nearly half had limited end-user engagement. Conclusions The HPW Implementation Framework is a comprehensive model for potentially understanding implementation effectiveness in Indigenous communities. The review suggests that the studies are reflective of high levels of community engagement and culture-centredness. The long-term sustainability and translation of evidence to practice may be inhibited because of lower levels of systems thinking and integrated knowledge translation.

AI applications are available for almost every domain of life. A new technology, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), was introduced by OpenAI in November 2022, and has become a topic of discussion across the world. ChatGPT-3 has brought many opportunities, as well as ethical and privacy considerations. ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) which has been trained on the events that happened until 2021. The use of AI and its assisted technologies in scientific writing is against research and publication ethics. Therefore, policies and guidelines need to be developed over the use of such tools in scientific writing. The main objective of the present study was to highlight the use of AI and AI assisted technologies such as the ChatGPT and other chatbots in the scientific writing and in the research domain resulting in bias, spread of inaccurate information and plagiarism. Methodology: Experiments were designed to test the accuracy of ChatGPT when used in research and academic writing. Results: The information provided by ChatGPT was inaccurate and may have far-reaching implications in the field of medical science and engineering. Critical thinking should be encouraged among researchers to raise awareness about the associated privacy and ethical risks. Conclusions: Regulations for ethical and privacy concerns related to the use of ChatGPT in academics and research need to be developed.

In insects, however, reports concerning the suitablility of siRNA in vivo is very limited compared with that of long dsRNA, which is thought to be more effective. There is insufficient information on the essential rules of siRNA design in insects, as very few siRNAs have been tested in this context. To establish an effective method of gene silencing using siRNA in vivo in insects, we determined the effects of siRNA on seven target genes. We designed siRNAs according to a new guideline and injected them into eggs of Bombyx mori. At the mRNA level, the expression of most of these genes was successfully silenced, down to less than half the constitutive level, which in some cases led to the development of distinctive phenotypes. In addition, we observed stronger effect of siRNA both on the mRNA level and the phenotype than that of long dsRNA under comparable conditions. These results indicate that direct injection of siRNA is an effective reverse-genetics tool for the analysis of embryogenesis in vivo in insects.

Methods A living labs approach was grounded in co-design principles and drew on the peer education, AT competency and capability-building knowledge base. Methods included embedding intersectional capabilities within the service, and the engagement of over 600 people in design thinking and program iterations through surveys, focus groups, journey mapping and think tanks. Results A national, peer-led, co-designed online community for AT users was established and has been running since 2017. The community of 5000 users contribute to a peer-led information and support initiative geared to share expertise and build AT decision making capability. Conclusions Service delivery by the AT user community and for the AT user community requires a commitment to co-design, and an engagement with concepts of risk, competency, scope of practice and capability. The learnings from AT Chat have implications for AT services on this journey everywhere.

Consumer Decision-Making Based on Review Websites: Are There Differences Between Choosing a Hotel and Choosing a Physician?	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Review						physician rating website; qualitative research; health care quality assessment; electronic word of mouth; health care provider; physician choice; patient satisfaction	WORD-OF-MOUTH; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; RATING WEBSITES; HEALTH-CARE; QUALITY; INFORMATION; GERMAN; CHOICE; RESUBSUMPTION; ASSOCIATIONS	Background: Web users are increasingly encouraged to rate and review consumer services (eg, hotels, restaurants) and, more recently, this is also the case for physicians and medical services. The resemblance in the setup and design of commercial rating websites (CRWs) and Web-based physician rating websites (PRWs) raises the question of whether choice-making processes based on the two types of websites could also be similar. Objective: This qualitative study sought to explore the extent to which consumer decision making based on Web-based reviews is the same for consumer services (ie, choice of a hotel) and health services (ie, choice of a pediatrician), while providing an in-depth understanding of potential differences or similarities. Methods: Between June and August 2015, we carried out a total of 22 qualitative interviews with young parents residing in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. Participants were invited to complete 2 choice tasks, which involved (1) choosing a hotel based on the commercial Web-based rating website TripAdvisor and (2) selecting a pediatrician based on the PRW Jameda. To better understand consumers' thought processes, we instructed participants to "think aloud", namely to verbalize their thinking while sorting through information and reaching decisions. Using a semistructured interview guide, we subsequently posed open-ended questions to allow them to elaborate more on factors influencing their decision making, level of confidence in their final choice, and perceived differences and similarities in their search for a hotel and a physician. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using an inductive thematic approach. Results: Participants spent on average 9: 57 minutes (standard deviation=9:22, minimum=3:46, maximum=22:25) searching for a hotel and 6: 17 minutes (standard deviation=4:47, minimum=00:38, maximum=19:25) searching for a pediatrician. Although the choice of a pediatrician was perceived as more important than the choice of a hotel, participants found choosing a physician much easier than selecting an appropriate accommodation. Four main themes emerged from the analysis of our interview data that can explain the differences in search time and choice confidence: (1) trial and error, (2) trust, (3) competence assessment, and (4) affect and likeability. Conclusions: Our results suggest that, despite congruent website designs, individuals only trust review information to choose a hotel, but refuse to fully rely on it for selecting a physician. The design and content of Web-based PRWs need to be adjusted to better address the differing information needs of health consumers.

J	Jang, S; Kim, HI				Jang, Sooyoung; Kim, Hyung-Il			Supervised pre-training for improved stability in deep reinforcement learning	ICT EXPRESS			English	Article						Deep reinforcement learning; Pre-training; Supervised learning; Maximum entropy; Stability		Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology has been actively studied with the recent advances in deep learning. As a result, the researchers are continuously improving performance and expanding the applications. However, recent literature reports that the performance of DRL is sensitive to the various design choices, e.g., the neural network initialization. Accordingly, it makes DRL hard to obtain a stable performance, which degrades reproducibility. Therefore, we propose a supervised pre-training method for both policy and value networks to improve stability. We pre-train the policy network to maximize the initial entropy and pre-train the value network to bias the distribution to a specific value. The experiments are conducted on tasks with discrete action space where it is hard to control the initial entropy. Through the experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of stability and performance is validated.(c) 2021 The Author(s).

Lights, Chemicals, Action: Studying Red Worms' Responses to Environmental Contaminants	AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER			English	Article						Animal distribution; behavior; biology; red worm; environmental health; inquiry-based learning; model; neuromuscular		We have developed an experimental module that introduces high school students to guided scientific inquiry. It is designed to incorporate environmental health and ecological concepts into the basic biology or environmental-science content of the high school curriculum. Using the red worm, a familiar live species that is amenable to classroom experimentation, students learn how environmental agents affect the animal's locomotion by altering sensory neuron-muscle interactions and, as a result, influence its distribution in nature. In turn, the results of these experiments have direct application to human-caused environmental disruptions that cause changes in species distribution and indirectly increase the recognition that environmental chemicals affect human health. Students undertake a series of explorations to identify how red worms sense their environment and then apply that knowledge to understand the effects of chemical exposure on locomotor behavior. The activities are designed to generate critical thinking about neuromuscular processes and environmental pollutants that affect them.

They are thought to mainly target the L-type calcium channels, but low selectivity prompts them to block Cav1.2 and Cav3.1 channels simultaneously. Recently, some novel DHPs with different hydrophobic groups have been synthesized and among them M12 has a higher selectivity for Cav3.1. However, the structural information about Cav3.1-DHPs complexes is not available in the experiment. Thus, we combined homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding free energy calculations to quantitatively elucidate the inhibition mechanism of DHPs. The calculated results indicate that our model is in excellent agreement with experimental results. On the basis of conformational analysis, we identify the main interactions between DHPs and calcium channels and further elaborate on the different selectivity of ligands from the micro perspective. In conjunction with energy distribution, we propose that the binding sites of Cav3.1-DHPs is characterized by several interspersed hydrophobic amino acid residues on the IIIS6 and IVS6 segments. We also speculate the favorable function groups on prospective DHPs. Besides, our model provides important information for further mutagenesis experiments.

Contextual reasoning is conceived as selection and bringing 'on line' internal representations of the tasks that can be used to mediate goal-appropriate behavioral responses. Impairment in contextual reasoning is thought to play a key role in the pathophysiology and symptom formation of schizophrenia. The Cognitive Bias Task (CBT) has recently been designed and is thought to activate contextual reasoning. A study for applying this method to schizophrenic patients and healthy control subjects has been carried out. The data show that a large percentage of the schizophrenic subjects (87.5%) do not use a context-dependent procedure for reasoning. There was a gender difference in CBT performance in the healthy control group, with more females than males using a context-independent procedure, but not in patients. These findings appear to be in agreement with the body of literature supporting the hypothesis that schizophrenic patients utilize a more uneconomic data-driven information-processing procedure. The study of contextual reasoning seems to allow the identification of a fundamental cognitive process and/or crucial regions or circuits that further research could demonstrate parsimoniously account for large parts of the heterogeneous cognitive deficits of schizophrenia.

MOL, based on Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), was developed in routine clinical practice and has been used effectively across different health services by different practitioners. Access to MOL-style questions through a smartphone app could, potentially, help both the general public maintain robust mental health, and also be a useful adjunct to therapy for clinical populations. The app is called MindSurf because of its focus on helping people explore their thinking. Prior to developing the app and using it with different populations it was necessary to determine whether such an idea would be usable for and acceptable to potential app users. Therefore, a pilot study was conducted with a non-clinical sample to assess the usability and acceptability of the app including monitoring whether the questions delivered in this way were associated with any adverse events. Methods: A pilot study using quantitative as well as qualitative methods and incorporating a repeated measures, A-B design was conducted. Results: The 23 participants were healthy adult volunteers who were all either undergraduate students, postgraduate students, or staff of the University of Manchester. They received MOL-style questions on their mobile phones over a 1-week period. Qualitative results were encouraging and indicated that the format and style of questioning were acceptable to participants and did not lead to increased worry or concern. A one-way, repeated measures ANOVA indicated that there was a nonsignificant decrease in scores on the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS21) over a 2 week period. Discussion: The results of the pilot study justified development of MindSurf and further testing once it is available for use. A power analysis indicated that the pilot study was underpowered to detect significant effects but provided important information regarding the appropriate sample size for future research. The pilot study also indicated that future research should investigate the effects of receiving more than three questions per day. Conclusion: Results of the pilot study indicate that MindSurf will be a usable and acceptable app. Its benefits should be further explored through longer studies with larger sample of both the general population as well as clinical populations.

We searched studies from the following data bases 'Academic FileOne, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Communication & Mass Media Complete, eBook (EBSCOHost), HeinOnline, OAPEN Library, PsychARTICLES, PsychINFO, SocINDEX, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar; and the North-West University repository' and for the period spanning 2003 to 2013. Studies included for the analysis met these criteria: Published between 2003 and 2013; published and written in English, student participant samples from tertiary institutions such as a universities or colleges; programmes or interventions developed and implemented with a positive effect on well-being or self-regulation; application of the Tomatis (R) Method in a student population, irrespective of an experimental design. A total of 35 articles met the inclusion criteria. The evidence was thematically analysed using narrative analysis. Findings suggest the Tomatis (R) Method to be superior to alternative self-regulation approaches in decreasing psychosocial and emotional stressors, as well as enhancing well-being of students. The Tomatis (R) Method was as effective as alternative approaches in promoting self-awareness and self-monitoring. Alternative methods were more effective than the Tomatis (R) Method in aspects of critical thinking. The Tomatis (R) Method appears to compare well with other interventions for the promotion of self-regulation among tertiary students.

J	Ito, Y; Terasawa, Y; Umeda, S; Kawaguchi, J				Ito, Yuichi; Terasawa, Yuri; Umeda, Satoshi; Kawaguchi, Jun			Spontaneous Activation of Event Details in Episodic Future Simulation	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						episodic future thinking; future simulation; prospective memory; intention superiority effect; context-sensitivity; memory retrieval; recognition	MENTAL TIME-TRAVEL; PROSPECTIVE MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; THINKING; INTENTIONS; RETRIEVAL; MIND; PHENOMENOLOGY; DYNAMICS; BACK	Episodic future simulation is supported by both the retrieval and recombination of episodic details. It remains unclear, however, how individuals retrieve episodic details from memory to construct possible future scenarios; for this people must use details related to the planned future events appropriately. A potentially relevant cognitive process is the spontaneous activation of intention observed in prospective memory (i.e., the intention superiority effect). Previous studies on prospective memory have shown that the approximation of retrieval opportunities for future intentions activate related information, suggesting that the intention superiority effect is context-sensitive. We hypothesized that the same cognitive process underlies future simulation- that is, details related to future events should spontaneously become activated at the appropriate moment of future simulation to make that simulation plausible. In Experiment 1, participants took part in future experiments and formed intentions to perform particular actions for the next experiments. Subsequently, they imagined events that could occur up until they arrived at the experimental room on the day of the next experiment. During this exercise, they did not imagine engaging in the required experimental task. We measured the conceptual activation of intentionrelated information via a recognition task using intended action words as targets. The results showed the intention superiority effect-concepts related to participants' future intentions became active when envisioning future events approaching the next experiment. In Experiments 2 and 3, we ensured that the intention superiority effect in future simulation was context-sensitive by adding a control condition that required participants to imagine events other than the approaching future experiments. These results indicated that concepts related to the intended actions were spontaneously activated when imagined future events became both temporally and spatially close to the future simulation. Our finding suggests that spontaneous activation of details approaching the context of a future simulation helps in constructing plausible future scenarios.

Engaging critically with the evolving theory and practice of deep mapping we reveal how collaborative water research designed to provide a framework for indigenous water legislation is expressed visually on a Google Earth platform. This aquatic counter-map, or as we call it, a deep chart, not only empowers the Tlingit and Tagish, but reclaims and revitalises critical cultural values, whilst simultaneously preserving linguistic and cultural memory in a digital form. More broadly, the deep chart is currently being brought into global water ethic debates as a visual ethnocartographic example of an alternative relationship humans might have with water, paving the way for a new water consciousness. This is in direct contrast to current, dominant and sometimes destructive global water governance and water management models and practices. We showcase a participatory and aqua-centric deep charting paradigm that is evolving through Geographics Information Science (GIS) platforms in collaboration with the CTFN (Tlingit and Tagish) community and government. This research challenges the contemporary cartography of the dominant Anglo-American valuing of water. It also presents an alternative water vision that we argue can shift 'terra-centric' thinking towards 'aqua-centric' thinking. It further provides a blueprint for informing global water ethics debates.

Complexity is not only due to the external environment (market and/or technological turbulence) but also to the internal configuration and specificities. A recent stream of studies in organizational literature suggested that organizations should develop and deploy specific capabilities for facing complexity, namely dynamic capabilities. This means becoming more flexible. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes four main capabilities to face four dimensions of complexity. It then investigates if it is more appropriate to focus on a specific capability when facing higher levels of a specific dimension of complexity. The research methodology is a multiple case study in seven different organizational units of the same super-store corporate. Findings - Data showed some important results. First of all, internal complexity is unit specific rather than corporate or industry specific. Moreover, it can derive not only from unpredictability and rate of change, but also from variety of elements and their interactions. All these elements form complexity. Internal complexity is characterized by four main elements: uncertainty, dynamicity, diversity and interdependence. Finally, for each of these elements, different organizational strategies are used: in case of uncertainty, for example, a strategy used by the companies is the sharing of information and the development of redundancy. Originality/value - Originality lies in linking different capabilities with different dimensions of internal complexity.

Current approaches for obesity prevention based on health information extraction lack the integration of multi-modal datasets and the provision of a dedicated Decision Support System (DSS) for health behaviour assessment and coaching of children. Methods: Continuous co-creation process has been applied in the frame of the Design Thinking Methodology, involving children, educators and healthcare professional in the whole process. Such considerations were used to derive the user needs and the technical requirements needed for the conception of the Internet of Things (IoT) platform based on microservices. Results: To promote the adoption of healthy habits and the prevention of the obesity onset for children (9-12 years old), the proposed solution empowers children -including families and educators- in taking control of their health by collecting and following-up real-time information about nutrition, physical activity data coming from IoT devices, and interconnecting healthcare professionals to provide a personalised coaching solution. The validation has two phases involving +400 children (control/intervention group), on four schools in three countries: Spain, Greece and Brazil. The prevalence of obesity decreased in 75.5% from baseline levels in the intervention group. The proposed solution created a positive impression and satisfaction from the technology acceptance perspective. Conclusions: Main findings confirm that this ecosystem can assess behaviours of children, motivating and guiding them towards achieving personal goals. Clinical and Translational Impact Statement-This study presents Early Research on the adoption of a smart childhood obesity caring solution adopting a multidisciplinary approach; it involves researchers from biomedical engineering, medicine, computer science, ethics and education. The solution has the potential to decrease the obesity rates in children aiming to impact to get a better global health.

The choice of graphs is often based on preferences and familiarity rather than science. According to the literature on graph perception, effective graphs allow human brains to decode visual cues easily. Dot charts are easier to decode than bar charts, and thus they are more effective. Dot charts are a flexible and versatile way to display information about health inequality. Consistent with the health risk communication literature, the captions accompanying health inequality graphs should provide a numerical, explicitly calculated description of health inequality, expressed in absolute and relative terms, from carefully thought-out perspectives. ContextGraphs are an essential tool for communicating health inequality, a key health policy concern. The choice of graphs is often driven by personal preferences and familiarity. Our article is aimed at health policy researchers developing health inequality graphs for policy and scientific audiences and seeks to (1) raise awareness of the effective use of graphs in communicating health inequality; (2) advocate for a particular type of graph (ie, dot charts) to depict health inequality; and (3) suggest key considerations for the captions accompanying health inequality graphs. MethodsUsing composite review methods, we selected the prevailing recommendations for improving graphs in scientific reporting. To find the origins of these recommendations, we reviewed the literature on graph perception and then applied what we learned to the context of health inequality. In addition, drawing from the numeracy literature in health risk communication, we examined numeric and verbal formats to explain health inequality graphs. FindingsMany disciplines offer commonsense recommendations for visually presenting quantitative data. The literature on graph perception, which defines effective graphs as those allowing the easy decoding of visual cues in human brains, shows that with their more accurate and easier-to-decode visual cues, dot charts are more effective than bar charts. Dot charts can flexibly present a large amount of information in limited space. They also can easily accommodate typical health inequality information to describe a health variable (eg, life expectancy) by an inequality domain (eg, income) with domain groups (eg, poor and rich) in a population (eg, Canada) over time periods (eg, 2010 and 2017). The numeracy literature suggests that a health inequality graph's caption should provide a numerical, explicitly calculated description of health inequality expressed in absolute and relative terms, from carefully thought-out perspectives. ConclusionsGiven the ubiquity of graphs, the health inequality field should learn from the vibrant multidisciplinary literature how to construct effective graphic communications, especially by considering to use dot charts.

Teaching Sourcing in Upper Secondary School: A Comprehensive Sourcing Intervention With Follow-Up Data	READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY			English	Article						Comprehension; Instructional strategies; methods and materials; Digital; media literacy; Cognitive; Socio-cognitive; Critical Thinking; Learning from Text; New Literacies; Experimental; Quasi-experimental; 4-Adolescence	MULTIPLE-DOCUMENTS; SOURCE INFORMATION; TOPIC FAMILIARITY; INTERNET SOURCES; STUDENTS; SCIENCE; ONLINE; KNOWLEDGE; MODEL; WEB	In this quasi-experimental study, the authors examined the effects of an intervention designed to teach upper secondary school students to take source information, such as author expertise, into consideration when selecting, processing, and using textual resources to complete particular multiple-document literacy tasks. The intervention centered on a contrasting cases approach framed by authentic curriculum-based classroom activities and was implemented over six weeks by teachers who had participated in professional development seminars. The findings demonstrated that students who had participated in the sourcing intervention placed more value on source information when selecting texts, invested more time and effort in processing the texts they selected, and more frequently attributed textual ideas to their respective sources compared with students who had participated in typical classroom activities instead. These effects were observed on far transfer tasks in which students worked with multiple documents on different topics in different situational contexts for different purposes, and were sustained over a period of 5.5 weeks. The discussion highlights the uniqueness of the current intervention work and centers on the aspects of the sourcing intervention that likely promoted these broad, sustainable, and transferable sourcing skills in students. Attention is also directed to several possible lines of future research in this area.

In this paper, we introduce a non-cooperative medium access control game for wireless networks and propose new fully distributed carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) algorithms that are provably optimal in the sense that their long-term throughputs converge to the optimal solution of a utility maximization problem over the maximum throughput region. The most significant part of our approach lies in introducing novel price functions in agents' utilities so that the proposed game admits an ordinal potential function with no price-of-anarchy. The game formulation naturally leads to game-based dynamics finding a Nash equilibrium, but they often require global information. Toward our goal of designing fully distributed operations, we propose new game-inspired dynamics by utilizing a certain property of CSMA that enables links to estimate their temporary throughputs without message passing. They can be thought of as stochastic approximations to the standard dynamics, which is a new feature in our work, not prevalent in other traditional game-theoretic approaches. We show that they converge to a Nash equilibrium, and numerically evaluate their performance to support our theoretical findings.

Parents' Causal Talk: Links to Children's Causal Stance and Emerging Scientific Literacy	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						causal stance; parent input; scientific literacy	SCIENCE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS; EXPLANATION; CONVERSATIONS; KINDERGARTEN; INTERESTS; CLASSROOM; EDUCATION; CONTEXTS; THINKING; INCOME	To explore the potential contribution of parents' causal talk to preschooler's emerging scientific literacy and related interests, we observed 153 parent-child dyads playing together in a museum and in the lab. As in previous work, the frequency with which parents referenced causal information in their speech predicted the strength of their children's causal stance. In addition, the frequency with which parents invited their children to explain causal phenomena. but not the frequency with which they provided explanations to their children, was related to children's scientific literacy. These associations held even when controlling for children's parent-reported exposure to science in the home, as well as their general cognitive skills. Although causal conclusions are precluded by the correlational design, this research is consistent with the possibility that parents begin shaping their children's scientific engagement and literacy when they are as young as three years of age.

J	Xiong, JX; Wu, JZ				Xiong, Juxia; Wu, Jinzhao			Construction of approximate reasoning model for dynamic CPS network and system parameter identification	COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Cyber physical system; Network; Event message modeling; Interactive multi-model algorithm	CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS; SAFETY	CPS (Cyber Physical System) is a large and complex real-time feedback system that integrates computing processes, physical processes, communication networks, sensor networks, and control systems. It has the powerful function of sensing and controlling the physical environment, which is a big wave following the Internet technology. Because the forms of communication, interaction, and collaboration between heterogeneous units within the CPS are intricate and complex, a comprehensive model needs to be established to describe and analyze the CPS. This paper analyzes the CPS architecture and proposes a new and more complete CPS architecture, decomposes according to this architecture, and classifies the physical entities in the CPS. At the same time, event-based modeling thinking is used to define, classify and formalize event messages. Considering the higher real-time requirements of CPS, an event weighting algorithm was designed according to the different priorities of real-time events. In order to reduce the congestion caused by the limited network bandwidth in the CPS system, improve the ability to identify abnormal data with great uncertainty, and fully guarantee the response rate of the CPS system to emergencies, this paper analyzes the complexity of the CPS system from the perspective of information theory. The average dynamic complexity of the CPS system is set as a threshold to determine the level of information entropy of the sensor data in a certain period of time. The CPS system selects high information entropy data to send first. The effectiveness is analyzed through experiments.

An experimental design was used involving a pretest, post test, and retention test to compare an experimental and control group, as well as a general information form-for collecting basic information about the participating students and their families and the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking: Figural Form A. Results showed that project-based education influenced the students' creativity, since the statistical evaluations of each mental characteristic assessed in the creative thinking test revealed no significant difference (p>.05) between the pre- and post test scores of the experimental and control groups regarding the subdomain of elaboration. However, significant differences emerged concerning the subdomains of fluency, originality, abstractness of titles, resistance to premature closure, and overall creativity between the pre- and post tests (p < .01).

ANNALS OF BOTANY			English	Editorial Material						Alien plants; biodiversity; building energy efficiency; carbon sequestration; ecosystem services; green infrastructure; human health and well-being; policy; pollution; storm-water management; temperature regulation; urban	NEARBY NATURE; STREET TREES; HUMAN HEALTH; SHADE TREES; URBAN; DIVERSITY; VEGETATION; PLANTS; CITY; BIODIVERSITY	Background Green infrastructure is a strategic network of green spaces designed to deliver ecosystem services to human communities. Green infrastructure is a convenient concept for urban policy makers, but the term is used too generically and with limited understanding of the relative values or benefits of different types of green space and how these complement one another. At a finer scale/more practical level, little consideration is given to the composition of the plant communities, yet this is what ultimately defines the extent of service provision. This paper calls for greater attention to be paid to urban plantings with respect to ecosystem service delivery and for plant science to engage more fully in identifying those plants that promote various services. Scope Many urban plantings are designed based on aesthetics alone, with limited thought on how plant choice/composition provides other ecosystem services. Research is beginning to demonstrate, however, that landscape plants provide a range of important services, such as helping mitigate floods and alleviating heat islands, but that not all species are equally effective. The paper reviews a number of important services and demonstrates how genotype choice radically affects service delivery. Conclusions Although research is in its infancy, data are being generated that relate plant traits to specific services, thereby helping identify genotypes that optimize service delivery. The urban environment, however, will become exceedingly bland if future planting is simply restricted to monocultures of a few 'functional' genotypes. Therefore, further information is required on how to design plant communities where the plants identified (1) provide more than a single benefit (multifunctionality), (B) complement each other in maximizing the range of benefits that can be delivered in one location, and (3) continue to maintain public acceptance through diversity. The identification/development of functional landscape plants is an exciting and potentially high-impact arena for plant science.	[Cameron, Ross W.

Stem cell-based vascularization of microphysiological systems	STEM CELL REPORTS			English	Review							ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR; SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; SHEAR-STRESS; EFFICIENT DIFFERENTIATION; MICROFLUIDIC PLATFORM; PERIVASCULAR CELLS; MODEL; ANGIOGENESIS; MORPHOGENESIS; GENERATION	Microphysiological systems (MPSs) (i.e., tissue or organ chips) exploit microfluidics and 3D cell culture to mimic tissue and organ-level physiology. The advent of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has accelerated the use of MPSs to study human disease in a range of organ systems. However, in the reduction of system complexity, the intricacies of vasculature are an often-overlooked aspect of MPS design. The growing library of pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cell and perivascular cell protocols have great potential to improve the physiological relevance of vasculature within MPS, specifically for in vitro disease modeling. Three strategic categories of vascular MPS are outlined: self-assembled, interface focused, and 3D biofabricated. This review discusses key features and development of the native vasculature, linking that to how hiPSC-derived vascular cells have been generated, the state of the art in vascular MPSs, and opportunities arising from interdisciplinary thinking.

J	Hanson, CK; Liu, K				Hanson, Clara K.; Liu, Kayuet			Think about your friends and family: The disparate impacts of relationship-centered messages on privacy concerns, protective health behavior, and vaccination against Covid-19	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AVAILABILITY; ALTRUISM; NETWORKS; PARENTS	Objective To understand which factors affect how willing people are to share their personal information to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, and compare them to factors that affect other public health behaviors. Method We analyze data from three pre-registered online experiments conducted over eight months during the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States (April 3 2020 -November 25, 2020). Our primary analysis tests whether support for data sharing and intention to practice protective behavior increase in response to relationship-centered messages about prosociality, disease spread, and financial hardship. We then conduct a secondary correlational analysis to compare the demographic and attitudinal factors associated with willingness to share data, protective behavior, and intent to get vaccinated. Our sample (N = 650) is representative to socio-demographic characteristics of the U.S. population. Results We find the altruistic condition increased respondents' willingness to share data. In our correlational analysis, we find interactive effects of political ID and socio-demographic traits on likelihood to share data. In contrast, we found health behavior was most strongly associated with political ID, and intent to vaccinate was more associated with socio-demographic traits. Conclusions Our findings suggest that some public health messaging, even when it is not about data sharing or privacy, may increase public willingness to share data. We also find the role of socio-demographic factors in moderating the effect of political party ID varies by public health behavior.

J	Gao, CA; Chen, B; Wei, W				Gao, Chuang; Chen, Bin; Wei, Wei			Dynamic detection of wake-sleep transition with reaction time-magnitude	NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH			English	Article						wake-sleep transition; reaction time-magnitude; electroencephalogram; sleep-wake states	THOUGHT SUPPRESSION; ONSET; CONSCIOUSNESS; INSOMNIA; CYCLE; EEG	BACKGROUND: According to observable behaviors, sleep and wakefulness are two fundamentally different behavioral states. Although electroencephalogram (EEG) is traditionally used to define sleep stage, it is difficult to detect or to quantify microarousals or disruptions during sleep. In addition, initial sleep cannot be defined. It is thought that the wake-sleep transition cannot be defined by EEG patterns. OBJECTIVE: To observe the behavioral response magnitude during wake-sleep transition by EEG monitoring and to define the wake-sleep transition. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: A behavioral and neural network study was performed at the Key Lab of Human Being Development and Mental Health of Central China Normal University, and Lab of Brain and Cognitive Science of South Central University for Nationalities, China in July 2007. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 30 healthy volunteers, of equal gender and aged (1 9.7 +/- 1.1) years, were recruited from the Central China Normal University, China for this study. None of the subjects had undergone EEG recording prior to this study or received any medication for sleep disturbances. METHODS: A novel adaptive approach was applied to detect wake-sleep transition, which avoided stimulus-induced waking. To test the difference between wake state and wake-sleep transition, the amount of self-information and mutual-information were effective parameters to analyze wake-sleep transition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The following parameters were measured: morphological changes in reaction time-magnitude, as well as correlation between phase changes and sleep, and wake and wake-sleep transition. RESULTS: There were three typical phases in morphological changes of reaction time-magnitude. With regard to the behavioral definition and criterion for sleep, the phase morphological characteristics displayed good correlation with behavioral states, such as sleep, wakefulness, and sleep onset. Entropy as an indicator of brain cognitive processes was introduced to test for differences between the wakefulness and sleep onset phase. Results indicated a cognitive declined transitional period different between sleep and wake. After staggered cognitive changes during the wake-sleep transition, the brain underwent marked alterations and transitioned into sleep quickly with no bi-directional EEG changes. CONCLUSION: Wake-sleep transition exists as an independent stage.

J	Xue, W; Lu, XX				Xue, Wei; Lu, Xiaoxia			A Comparative Study on the Demand Analysis of Follow-Up Teaching Courses of English Curriculum Based on Embedded Wireless Communication Multimedia Aid	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article								College English follow-up courses are an important part of "University English Curriculum Teaching Requirements" and college English curriculum reform, and its purpose is to meet the individual needs of learners at different levels. "College English Curriculum Teaching Requirements" pointed out "Each school should design its own college English curriculum system according to the curriculum requirements and the college English teaching objectives of the school, while ensuring the improvement of students' language proficiency, it should be conducive to students' personalized learning. to meet their respective development requirements." With the rise and development of computer technology, human society has ushered in the fifth information technology revolution. In just a few decades, people's life and production methods have undergone tremendous changes. Computer information technology has been widely used in military, medical, commercial, education, and industrial fields. Multimedia-assisted teaching has incomparable advantages in these situations. The use of network, computer, and multimedia has made the English classroom teaching methods changed essentially. Due to the huge storage capacity of the computer, it can use graphics, sound, and animation to express, organize, and store the corresponding text knowledge materials, so that the sound, image, and text can truly coexist, achieving an effective increase in the amount of information dissemination and enhancing stimulus intensity of information so as to make the students' enthusiasm for learning knowledge improved. It is precisely because of the powerful information dissemination ability, information processing ability, and convenient and fast interactive form of multimedia itself that it can be used in teaching to enrich the way of classroom teaching activities and make classroom teaching methods no longer single, which can make students better complete the transition from concrete image thinking to abstract logical thinking. The smooth development of college English follow-up courses will continuously improve the English quality of our talents. Learners of different majors have different needs for follow-up college English teaching. Only when students of different majors adopt different teaching courses can they fully reflect the individuality and suitability of the courses. In order to understand the specific needs and views of students of different majors on the courses, students of different majors are made to adopt different teaching courses to get personalized and appropriate learning experience. We distributed questionnaires to senior students at a certain university and adopted Dudley-Evans and St John's needs analysis method for the survey results. It is found that liberal arts students are looking forward to the language application and language skills modules, and their satisfaction with these two modules is as high as 86.23%. The science students and engineering students are more satisfied with the two modules of professional English and language application. Among them, the satisfaction of science students on these two modules is 78.63%, and the satisfaction of engineering students is as high as 92.38%. Students of different majors have a positive attitude towards English follow-up courses, but there is a big difference between the courses offered by universities and the teaching mode. For example, 85.62% of liberal arts students are satisfied with the recognition of the course mode, and only 14.38% are dissatisfied; 66. 3% of science students are satisfied with the curriculum model, 33.7% are dissatisfied; 66.45% of engineering students are satisfied with the curriculum, and 33.55% are dissatisfied.

Many people think the primary objective of components is reuse. The best reuse is reuse of the design rather than implementation. So, it is necessary to study the component metrics that can be applied in the stage of the component analysis and design. In this paper, we propose component architecture redesigning approach using the component metrics. The proposed component metrics reflect the keynotes of component technology, base on the similarity information about behavior patterns of operations to offer the component's service. Also, we propose the component architecture redesigning approach. That uses the clustering principle, makes the component design as the independent functional unit having the high-level reusability and cohesion, low level complexity and coupling.

Here we introduce a customizable and flexible workflow, designed with the SARS CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 in mind, as a means of reinforcing fundamental biology concepts using bioinformatics approaches. This workflow is accessible to a wide range of students in life science majors regardless of their prior bioinformatics knowledge, and all software is freely available, thus eliminating potential cost barriers. Using the workflow can thus provide a diverse group of students the opportunity to conduct inquiry-driven research. Here we demonstrate the utility of this workflow and outline the logical steps involved in the identification of therapeutic or vaccine targets against SARS CoV-2. We also provide an example of how the workflow may be adapted to other infectious microbes.

Design and Methods The study used a descriptive and cross-sectional research design. The study sample consisted of 130 senior nursing students. The data were collected from the Student Information Form, Nursing Professional Values Scale, and Nursing Dilemma Test (NDT). The data were evaluated using Pearson correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analysis. Findings A significant correlation was found between students' professional values and their mean PLT total scores (p < 0.01). Also, a negative correlation was found between students' professional values and the total mean practical thinking scores (p < 0.01). Professional values of the students explained 21.2% of the total PLT score and 0.08% of the total practical thinking score. Conclusion The professional values of the students affect their principal and practical thinking skills in ethical dilemmas. Implications for Nursing Practice It is recommended to discuss the ethical dilemmas observed or experienced by the students in their clinical practice in the field, increase the awareness of the students, and teach them how to deal with ethical dilemmas.

The Development of a Communication Tool to Aid Parent-Centered Communication between Parents and Healthcare Professionals: A Quality Improvement Project	HEALTHCARE			English	Article						complex medical needs; family centered care; shared decision making; children; communication	PALLIATIVE CARE; PROVIDER COMMUNICATION; META-SYNTHESIS; EXPERIENCES; CHILDREN; PATIENT; SKILLS; PERCEPTIONS; FRAMEWORK; SURGERY	Good communication is central to good healthcare. As a result of poor communication between parents and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in clinical settings, this study aimed to address this problem by developing a communication tool to empower parents and act as a prompt for HCPs to talk about the child's care and gather information at the point of admission to hospital about what is important to families, therefore supporting patient-centered communication. A design thinking process was used to develop a physical copy of Chloe's card and evaluate its use. Design thinking is a problem-solving approach, which uses an empathetic lens to integrate viewpoints of different stakeholders throughout the process of creating solutions. Design thinking involves five processes: (1) empathise-including a literature review and data synthesis, (2) define-by completing semi-structured interviews with parents about their experience of communication and HCPs perceptions of parent's experience of communication, (3) ideate-iterate the design of Chloe's card with parents and HCPs, (4) prototype-develop the design of Chloe's card, and (5) test-pilot test in clinical practice. Results from this initial study suggest that a small hand-held card, with emoticons and a place to write concerns, was acceptable to parents and feasible to use in clinical practice. Parents do not always feel heard by HCPs and a tool such as Chloe's card may help facilitate sharing of information about matters important to them and their child. However, some HCPs felt the need for a communication tool undermined their clinical skills. Feedback from HCP participants suggests that the idea of Chloe's card was acceptable and perceived as potentially being useful in clinical practice. Further work is required, as part of a larger study, to further refine this communication tool, identify those parents who would benefit most from Chloe's card, as well as to further refine the HCP process prior to implementing it into clinical settings. It was noted future iterations would benefit from a digital version linked with a child's electronic record, as well as multi-language versions and information for parents.

Low Vision Impairs Implicit Sensorimotor Adaptation in Response to Small Errors, But Not Large Errors	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CENTRAL VISUAL IMPAIRMENT; VISUOMOTOR ADAPTATION; SENSORY PREDICTION; MOVEMENT; EXPLICIT; INTERFERENCE; INTEGRATION; PERCEPTION; CONTRAST	Successful goal-directed actions require constant fine-tuning of the motor system. This fine-tuning is thought to rely on an implicit adaptation process that is driven by sensory prediction errors (e.g., where you see your hand after reaching vs. where you expected it to be). Individuals with low vision experience challenges with visuomotor control, but whether low vision disrupts motor adaptation is unknown. To explore this question, we assessed individuals with low vision and matched controls with normal vision on a visuomotor task designed to isolate implicit adaptation. We found that low vision was associated with attenuated implicit adaptation only for small visual errors, but not for large visual errors. This result highlights important constraints underlying how low-fidelity visual information is processed by the sensorimotor system to enable successful implicit adaptation.

The aim of this study is to establish how IBL is used and what effects it has on university students from social sciences and health sciences. This study follows the PRISMA guidelines for conducting systematic reviews. It comprises an analysis of 31 studies extracted from four electronic databases and reference lists on the topic, published in English between 1998-2019. The results show that the strengths of IBL are: 1) promoting cooperative learning, 2) engaging students in self-learning, and 3) increasing critical thinking. Its weaknesses include: 1) the inability to meet learning expectations, and 2) the reluctance of university hierarchies to embrace IBL. The potential of IBL as a teaching strategy at university level is discussed as it allows deep knowledge construction, increased learning motivation, and development of students' research skills as well as their self-learning, self-confidence, critical thinking, and academic performance. IBL favours meaningful learning by university students by offering a space for the creation of knowledge stimulated by the inquiry process.

Policy coherence across agro-food and bioeconomy policy domains in the EU	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Biobased economy; Agri-food policy; Science-policy interface; Uncertainty; Ambiguity	GLOBAL LAND-USE; INTEGRATED-ASSESSMENT; UNCERTAINTY; BIOENERGY; FOREST; LIFE; COMPLEXITY; SECURITY; IMPACTS; BIOMASS	The European Union (EU) envisions a shift towards a bioeconomy to address challenges such as reducing dependence on non-renewable resources, managing natural resources sustainably and food security. As a result, biomass will become an increasingly important resource in the bioeconomy. This will require careful and sustainable management especially because biomass comes from a wide variety of economic sectors and is governed by different policies. The bioeconomy will, therefore, require coherence between many different policy domains. However, little is known how policy goals in these domains interact and how these interactions may play out in different contexts. Hence, this study aims to assess coherence between bioeconomy and agro-food policies by assessing the interactions between bioeconomy and agro-food goals (i.e. trade-offs, synergies) as well as revealing knowledge gaps. Utilising qualitative content analysis, a survey and focus groups, we find that bioeconomy policy goals and agro-food policy goals are largely considered to be consistent, when considering coherence scores only, and that synergies outweigh trade-offs, both in quantity and in strength. However, all bioeconomy policy domains show some trade-offs with agro-food policy. We furthermore find disagreement (i.e. range of scores) and uncertainty in scientific knowledge-base, particularly concerning waste and bio-based industry. Disagreement surrounds the feasibility of some policy goals, such as decoupling economic growth from the environment. We conclude that a shift towards a bioeconomy will have to acknowledge the interactions between different policy goals across the different sectors and avoid 'silo-thinking'. This can be achieved through addressing vagueness in policies and allowing integrated policies to embrace uncertainty.	[Muscat, A.; de Olde, E. M.; de Boer, I. J.

J	Li, W; Luo, YM; Tang, C; Zhang, KQ; Ma, XY				Li, Wei; Luo, Youmeng; Tang, Chao; Zhang, Kaiqiang; Ma, Xiaoyu			Boosted Fuzzy Granular Regression Trees	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							INFORMATION	The regression problem is a valued problem in the domain of machine learning, and it has been widely employed in many fields such as meteorology, transportation, and material. Granular computing (GrC) is a good approach of exploring human intelligent information processing, which has the superiority of knowledge discovery. Ensemble learning is easy to execute parallelly. Based on granular computing and ensemble learning, we convert the regression problem into granular space equivalently to solve and proposed boosted fuzzy granular regression trees (BFGRT) to predict a test instance. The thought of BFGRT is as follows. First, a clustering algorithm with automatic optimization of clustering centers is presented. Next, in terms of the clustering algorithm, we employ MapReduce to parallelly implement fuzzy granulation of the data. Then, we design new operators and metrics of fuzzy granules to build fuzzy granular rule base. Finally, a fuzzy granular regression tree (FGRT) in the fuzzy granular space is presented. In the light of these, BFGRT can be designed by parallelly combing multiple FGRTs via random sampling attributes and MapReduce. Theory and experiments show that BFGRT is accurate, efficient, and robust.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first time this problem is studied from the computational point of view. We introduce a new network model for pollution control and present two applications of this model. On a high level, our model comprises a graph whose nodes represent the agents, which can be thought of as the sources of pollution in the network. The edges between agents represent the effect of spread of pollution. The government who is the regulator, is responsible for the maximization of the social welfare and sets bounds on the levels of emitted pollution in both local areas as well as globally in the whole network. We first prove that the above optimization problem is NP-hard even on some special cases of graphs such as trees. We then turn our attention on the classes of trees and planar graphs which model realistic scenarios of the emitted pollution in water and air, respectively. We derive approximation algorithms for these two kinds of networks and provide deterministic truthful and truthful in expectation mechanisms. In some settings of the problem that we study, we achieve the best possible approximation results under standard complexity theoretic assumptions. Our approximation algorithm on planar graphs is obtained by a novel decomposition technique to deal with constraints on vertices. We note that no known planar decomposition techniques can be used here and our technique can be of independent interest. For trees we design a two level dynamic programming approach to obtain an FPTAS. This approach is crucial to deal with the global pollution quota constraint.

A Holistic Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						eHealth; design; participation; implementation; evaluation; multidisciplinary approach; Health 2.0; Wiki; e-collaboration	HEALTH INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; WEB-BASED INTERVENTION; USER ACCEPTANCE; CARE; SUCCESS; DESIGN; TELEMEDICINE; SERVICES; IMPLEMENTATION; COMMUNICATION	Background: Many eHealth technologies are not successful in realizing sustainable innovations in health care practices. One of the reasons for this is that the current development of eHealth technology often disregards the interdependencies between technology, human characteristics, and the socioeconomic environment, resulting in technology that has a low impact in health care practices. To overcome the hurdles with eHealth design and implementation, a new, holistic approach to the development of eHealth technologies is needed, one that takes into account the complexity of health care and the rituals and habits of patients and other stakeholders. Objective: The aim of this viewpoint paper is to improve the uptake and impact of eHealth technologies by advocating a holistic approach toward their development and eventual integration in the health sector. Methods: To identify the potential and limitations of current eHealth frameworks (1999-2009), we carried out a literature search in the following electronic databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge, PiCarta, and Google Scholar. Of the 60 papers that were identified, 44 were selected for full review. We excluded those papers that did not describe hands-on guidelines or quality criteria for the design, implementation, and evaluation of eHealth technologies (28 papers). From the results retrieved, we identified 16 eHealth frameworks that matched the inclusion criteria. The outcomes were used to posit strategies and principles for a holistic approach toward the development of eHealth technologies; these principles underpin our holistic eHealth framework. Results: A total of 16 frameworks qualified for a final analysis, based on their theoretical backgrounds and visions on eHealth, and the strategies and conditions for the research and development of eHealth technologies. Despite their potential, the relationship between the visions on eHealth, proposed strategies, and research methods is obscure, perhaps due to a rather conceptual approach that focuses on the rationale behind the frameworks rather than on practical guidelines. In addition, the Web 2.0 technologies that call for a more stakeholder-driven approach are beyond the scope of current frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we composed a holistic framework based on a participatory development approach, persuasive design techniques, and business modeling. Conclusions: To demonstrate the impact of eHealth technologies more effectively, a fresh way of thinking is required about how technology can be used to innovate health care. It also requires new concepts and instruments to develop and implement technologies in practice. The proposed framework serves as an evidence-based roadmap.	[van Gemert-Pijnen, Julia E. W.

What do women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) understand about their chance of IVF success?	HUMAN REPRODUCTION			English	Article; Early Access						IVF; fertility; chance; success; understanding; knowledge; information; explanation; estimate	ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY; PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS; FERTILITY CARE; VALIDATION; KNOWLEDGE; AWARENESS; AGE	STUDY QUESTION How well informed are Australian women who undergo IVF about their chances of having a baby?SUMMARY ANSWER Only one in four women estimated their individual chance of success with IVF accurately, with most women overestimating their chance.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Limited knowledge about infertility and infertility treatment in the general population is well-documented. The few studies that have investigated patients' knowledge about the chance of IVF success suggest that while IVF patients are aware of average success rates, they tend to be unrealistic about their own chance of success.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION We conducted an anonymous online survey of 217 women who had started IVF since 2018 in Australia. The survey was advertised on social media, enabling women from across Australia to participate. Responses were collected in June 2021.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS The survey included questions on demographic characteristics and IVF history. It asked what participants thought their chance of having a baby from one IVF treatment cycle was, how they rated their knowledge about chance of success, and about their experience of receiving IVF-related information. Participants' estimations of their chance of success were compared with their chance as calculated by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology's (SART) online calculator. Responses to a free-text question about what information women wished they had been given when they started treatment were analysed thematically.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Only about a quarter (58/217, 27%) of participants accurately estimated their chance of having a baby within 20% relative to their SART calculated chance, with more than half (118/217, 54%) overestimating their chance. Ninety percent of women indicated that their preferred source of treatment information was a consultation with their doctor, despite less than half (44%) reporting that doctors explained the probability of having a baby with IVF well (mean 5.9/10). In free-text responses, many women also reported that they wished they had been given more realistic information about IVF and their chance of success.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The dissemination method precludes calculation of response rate, and it is not possible to know if participants are representative of all women undergoing IVF. Additionally, we only surveyed women undergoing IVF, while those who decided not to have IVF were not included. Therefore, women who overestimated their chance may have been overrepresented. There is also inherent imprecision in the way understanding of chance of success was estimated. The potential impact of recall bias could neither be quantified nor excluded. It is difficult to determine to what extent women's lack of understanding of what is possible with IVF is due to poor information-provision by clinicians and the clinic, and how much can be explained by optimism bias.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The finding of poor understanding of personal chance of success amongst women undergoing IVF in Australia requires further investigation to determine potential reasons for this. The findings can be used by clinics to develop strategies for improvement in the information-provision process to ensure that women can make informed decisions about their fertility treatment.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S) This study received no external funding.

J	Farris, AV; Dickes, AC; Sengupta, P				Farris, Amy Voss; Dickes, Amanda C.; Sengupta, Pratim			Learning to Interpret Measurement and Motion in Fourth Grade Computational Modeling	SCIENCE & EDUCATION			English	Article							SCIENCE-EDUCATION; THINKING; SIMULATIONS; IDENTITY; AGENCY	Studies of scientific practice demonstrate that the development of scientific models is an enactive and emergent process (e.g., Pickering 1995; Chandrasekharan and Nersessian 2017). Scientists make meaning through processes such as perspective taking, finding patterns, and following intuitions. In this paper, we focus on how a group of fourth grade learners and their teacher engaged in interpretation in ways that align with core ideas and practices in kinematics and computing. Cycles of measuring and modeling--including computer programming--helped to support classroom interactions that highlighted the interpretive nature of modeling and participation in model construction as a knowledge-building process. We draw on literature from the history and philosophy of science in order to analyze the students' interpretive actions as forms of epistemic and representational agency, constituting a construct we term disciplined interpretation. We demonstrate how students' disciplined interpretative moves help to position them as owners of their own design decisions and their rights to interpret the phenomena they were modeling, data collected from those phenomena, and the scientific and computational models themselves. We present four extended episodes that characterize the nature of activity in the classroom and the development of students' disciplined interpretations in terms of learning to recognize scientific patterns amid complex perceptual fields, and to represent them in ways that support sensemaking.

Developing Students' Scientific Reasoning Abilities with an Inquiry-Based Learning Methodology: Applying FTIR Spectroscopy to the Study of Thermodynamic Equilibria in Hydrogen-Bonded Species	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Inquiry-Based Discovery Learning; IR Spectroscopy; Hydrogen Bonding; Upper-Division Undergraduate; Laboratory Instruction; Physical Chemistry	DIMER; ACID; ASSOCIATION	Laboratory experiences are a key and integral part of the chemistry degree that are intended to provide the students the necessary training for laboratory work and improve their scientific reasoning/research abilities and their understanding of the uncertainty in experimental measurements. Despite the unquestionable capacity of hands-on laboratory experiences to achieve these objectives, there is a general concern that, on many occasions, students are still somewhat immature in their ability to think things through, even in the latter courses. Keeping in mind that scientific reasoning is innate in humans, the reason why even science students may lack this ability near the end of their academic undergraduate trajectory may lay in the way that many of these courses are designed, i.e., mainly as follow-up recipes of chemical processes that, in the best of cases, will ensure that the participants seek information and reflect on the theoretical aspects related to the experiments carried out. In this work we present an inquiry-based learning approach (IBL) where students are expected to use FTIR spectroscopy and apply thermodynamic concepts to study the equilibrium of formation of H-bonded dimers of benzoic acid in solvents of different polarity.

DHSs have been mapped by capturing the ends of long DNase I-cut fragments (> 100,000 bp), or 100-1200 bp DNase I-double cleavage fragments (also called double-hit fragments). But next generation sequencing requires a DNA library containing DNA fragments of 100-500 bp. Therefore, we used short DNA fragments released by DNase I digestion to generate DNA libraries for next generation sequencing. The short segments are 100-300 bp and can be directly cloned and used for high-throughput sequencing. We identified 83,897 DHSs in 2,343,479 tags across the human genome. Our results indicate that the DHSs identified by this DHS assay are consistent with those identified by longer fragments in previous studies. We also found: (1) the distribution of DHSs in promoter and other gene regions of similarly expressed genes differs among different chromosomes; (2) silenced genes had a more open chromatin structure than previously thought; (3) DHSs in 3'untranslated regions (3'UTRs) are negatively correlated with level of gene expression.

The under-representation of women, African-American and Latinx professionals in the IT workforce is a longstanding issue that contributes to and is impacted by algorithmic bias. Design/methodology/approach Sources of algorithmic bias in talent acquisition software are presented. Feminist design thinking is presented as a theoretical lens for mitigating algorithmic bias. Findings Data are just one tool for recruiters to use; human expertise is still necessary. Even well-intentioned algorithms are not neutral and should be audited for morally and legally unacceptable decisions. Feminist design thinking provides a theoretical framework for considering equity in the hiring decisions made by talent acquisition systems and their users. Originality/value This work uses equity as a central concept for considering algorithmic bias in talent acquisition. Feminist design thinking provides a framework for fostering a richer understanding of what fairness means and evaluating how AI software might impact marginalized populations.

Keyword vs. natural language search was the within-participants factor; simple vs. complex tasks was the between-participants factor. There were cross-over interactions such that complex-task participants were more successful and thought the tasks were less difficult and reported more enjoyment and confidence when they used keyword search vs. natural language queries, while the opposite was found for simple-task participants. The findings suggest that natural language search is not the panacea for all information retrieval tasks: task complexity is a critical mediator.

However, in today's teaching environment, teachers' teaching activities still do not get rid of the traditional thinking mode, and there is no fundamental change in teaching contents. In this context, the application of smart multimedia college English classroom teaching integrating Internet of Things technology was born. This paper mainly studied the optimization effect of smart multimedia integrated with Internet of Things technology on college English classrooms. The students of Baotou Medical College were taken as the research object; first, carry out information perception and data mining analysis work related to English, and finally, carry out diversified and situational teaching through smart multimedia. The degree of effect of optimization is reflected by the changes in the scores of students with different English abilities before and after. This paper mainly studied the optimization of college English classrooms with smart multimedia integrated with IoT, and the effect of optimization was reflected by the changes in the scores of students in Baotou Medical College before and after the experiment with different English abilities. This paper selected 10 sophomore students in Baotou Medical College and used their final English test scores as the benchmark to make statistics on different ability scores. Then, these students were given smart multimedia English classroom teaching activities, and they were tested on their English scores; a comparative analysis of the performance of different students with different English language skills before and after the test had to be done. The results showed that after 30 days of smart multimedia teaching, the English ability of 10 students has been improved. Among them, the average score of listening comprehension increased by 10.2 points, with the largest increase of 53.7%, and the average score of written expression ability increased by 1.1 points, with the smallest increase of 15.3%. Through a specific analysis of its ability, it was concluded that in terms of listening comprehension ability, the score of student 5 was improved to 13 points, the largest increase was 86%, the score of student 2 was improved to 7 points, and the smallest increase was 28%. In terms of reading comprehension, student 4's score increased by 9 points, the largest increase was 56%, and the scores of students 2 and 9 were 2 points; the smallest increase was 7%. To sum up, the smart multimedia in the framework of the Internet of Things technology has a positive feedback effect on the optimization of college English classrooms, and different students' different English abilities have been improved to varying degrees. This provides some guiding suggestions for the subsequent changes in the learning modalities of the undergraduate English classroom.

Semi-Structured Qualitative Interviews in Europe and the USA	PATIENT-PATIENT CENTERED OUTCOMES RESEARCH			English	Article							CARE DECISION-MAKING; ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; HEALTH-CARE; BENEFITS; RISKS; VOICE	Background Patient preferences (PP), which are investigated in PP studies using qualitative or quantitative methods, are a growing area of interest to the following stakeholders involved in the medical product lifecycle: academics, health technology assessment bodies, payers, industry, patients, physicians, and regulators. However, the use of PP in decisions along the medical product lifecycle remains limited. As the adoption of PP heavily relies on these stakeholders, knowledge of their perceptions of PP is critical. Objective This study aimed to characterize stakeholders' attitudes, needs, and concerns with respect to PP in decision making along the medical product lifecycle. Methods Semi-structured interviews (n = 143) were conducted with academics (n = 24), health technology assessment/payer representatives (n = 24), industry representatives (n = 24), patients, caregivers and patient representatives (n = 24), physicians (n = 24), and regulators (n = 23) from seven European countries and the USA. Interviews were conducted between April and August 2017. The framework method was used to organize the data and identify themes and key findings in each interviewed stakeholder group. Results Interviewees reported being unfamiliar (43%), moderately familiar (42%), or very familiar (15%) with preference methods and studies. Interviewees across stakeholder groups generally supported the idea of using PP in the medical product lifecycle but expressed mixed opinions about the feasibility and impact of using PP in decision making. Interviewees from all stakeholder groups stressed the importance of increasing stakeholders' understanding of the concept of PP and preference methods and ensuring patients' understanding of the questions asked in PP studies. Key concerns and needs in each interviewed stakeholder group were as follows: (1) academics: investigating the validity, reliability, reproducibility, and generalizability of preference methods; (2) health technology assessment/payer representatives: developing quality criteria for evaluating PP studies and gaining insights into how to weigh them in reimbursement/payer decision making; (3) industry representatives: obtaining guidance on PP studies and recognition on the importance of PP from decision makers; (4) patients, caregivers, and patient representatives: providing an incentive and adequate information towards patients when participating in PP studies; (5) physicians: avoiding bias as a result of commercial agendas in PP studies and clarifying how to deal with subjective and emotional elements when measuring PP; and (6) regulators: avoiding the misuse of PP study results to overrule the traditional efficacy and safety criteria used for marketing authorization and obtaining robust PP study results. Conclusions Despite the interest all interviewed stakeholder groups reported in PP, the effective use of PP in decision making across the medical product lifecycle is currently hampered by a lack of standardization and consensus on how to both measure and use PP.

Swaminathan			Intracellular Communication between Synthetic Macromolecules	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							GENE DELIVERY; TRANSFECTION; DENDRIMERS; DNA; NANOPARTICLES; FLEXIBILITY; PROTEINS; POLYMERS; CELLS; SIZE	Non-viral delivery is an important strategy for selective and efficient gene therapy, immunization, and RNA interference, which overcomes problems of genotoxicity and inherent immunogenicity associated with viral vectors. Liposomes and polymers are compelling candidates as carriers for intracellular, non-viral delivery, but maximal efficiencies of around 1% have been reported for the most advanced non-viral carriers. Here, we develop a library of dendronized bottlebrush polymers with controlled defects, displaying a level of precision surpassed only by biological molecules like DNA, RNA, and proteins. We test concurrent and competitive delivery of DNA and show for the first time that, while intracellular communication is thought to be an exclusively biomolecular phenomenon, such communication between synthetic macromolecular complexes can also take place. Our findings challenge the assumption that delivery agents behave as bystanders that enable transfection by passive intracellular release of genetic cargo and improve upon coarse strategies in intracellular carrier design lacking control over polymer sequence, architecture, and composition, leading to a hit-or-miss outcome. Understanding the communication that takes place between macromolecules will help improve the design of non-viral delivery agents and facilitate translation of genome engineering, vaccines, and nucleic acid-based therapies.

Heterogeneity was assessed by I2 statistics. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used for effect size analysis based on learning outcomes. Results: Sixteen studies were selected in the systematic review and 13 studies with 1637 nursing students were included in the meta-analysis. Five debriefing methods were used in the intervention group. The analysis showed that Debriefing for Meaningful Learning was more effective on the debriefing quality (SMD = 0.52, 95%CI [0.32, 0.72]), and that video-assisted debriefing was more effective on nursing students' experiences (SMD = 0.30, 95% CI [0.02, 0.58]) and critical thinking (SMD = 0.90, 95%CI [0.65, 1.15]) compared with the usual debriefing. However, written debriefing did not show better effects on students' experiences (SMD = -0.22, 95%CI [-0.51, 0.07]), and peer-led debriefing did not show better effects on the debriefing quality compared with the usual debriefing (SMD = -0.15, 95%CI [-1.43, -0.67]). Conclusions: The study indicated that Debriefing for Meaningful Learning and video-assisted debriefing showed a positive impact on nursing education. Future studies that have larger sample sizes, high-quality debriefing methods, robust study designs, and other learning outcomes are required.

A critique of the traditional empiricist framework for understanding the development of cognitive structures and processes is described. An evolutionary framework is provided as an alternative. The ambiguity between culture-related and culturally caused differences is also elaborated. Reasons for cultural universality in spatial cognition are then considered. With these ideas as background, some aspects of spatial cognition are enumerated that I believe are largely culturally universal. Following that, aspects that may show more significant cultural variability are discussed. In particular, the relationship of spatial language to spatial thought is addressed in some depth. I conclude that cultural differences in spatial cognition are not nearly as substantial as is often claimed. Finally, the extent to which cultural differences in spatial cognition are important for geographic information system (GIS) research and design is considered.

The core idea is to directly project electroencephalogram (EEG) information onto a SIQR neural network model, rather than simulate the complex neuronal connections. To the end, we establish a multimodal brain-visual dataset, and propose a Cross-GAN model including a binocular attention-based fusion (BAF) image modality encoder, a multiscale spatiotemporal (MST) EEG modality encoder and a multimodal feature generation GAN (MF-GAN). In the BAF image encoder, the progressive interactive attention fusion is designed to highlight the significant regions of the image from monocular view to binocular view, which contributes to the global information description of single view and fused view. In the MST EEG encoder, spectral norm normalization constraint is adopted to assure the Lipschitz continuity, and the multiscale convolution blocks is presented to capture EEG representations from spatiotemporal perspective. Finally, the monomodal image and EEG features are sent to the MF-GAN for creating the optimal brain-visual manifold under the control of the generative loss function. Extensive experiments on the brain-visual multimodality SIQR database prove that the CrossGAN can improve the performance via projecting brain response onto image evaluation model in a cross-modal manner, with no need of EEG trails in application.

J	Niszczota, P; Pawlak, M; Bialek, M				Niszczota, Pawel; Pawlak, Magdalena; Bialek, Michal			Bilinguals are less susceptible to the bias blind spot in their second language	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BILINGUALISM			English	Article; Early Access						Bilingualism; bias blind spot; cognitive biases; economic biases; foreign language effect; judgment; metacognition	FOREIGN-LANGUAGE; THINKING; MODEL	Aims and objectives/purpose/research questions: Extant research suggests that processing information in a second language (L2) affects decision-making, possibly by affecting metacognition. We hypothesized that processing in L2 will reduce the bias blind spot effect, whereby people (on average) erroneously think that they are less susceptible to biases than others. Design/methodology/approach: In Experiment 1, participants assessed their susceptibility and the susceptibility of others to 13 psychological and 7 economic biases, in either L1 (Polish) or L2 (English). In Experiment 2, participants assessed the 7 most severe bias blind spots from Experiment 1. Data and analysis: We recruited 500 participants for each experiment via Prolific (832 overall, after exclusions). The main hypothesis and moderators were tested via mixed-model regressions. Findings/conclusions: In Experiment 1, participants showed an overall bias blind spot, which decreased in the L2 condition, but only for psychological biases. In Experiment 2, we replicated the L2-bias blind spot attenuation effect. An exploratory analysis suggests that the effect of L2 is the result of both lower ratings of other-susceptibility and higher ratings of self-susceptibility. Originality: Our study provides unique insights into how L2 affects metacognition. We are the first to study how the use of L2 can attenuate the bias blind spot. Our findings provide rare support for the psychological distancing ("birds-eye view") explanation for the foreign language effect. Significance/implications: Bilinguals using L2 showed some resilience to the bias blind spot, suggesting metacognition is language dependent.

J	Wang, C; Shen, YL; Ji, LP				Wang, Chi; Shen, Yulin; Ji, Luping			Geometry Attention Transformer with position-aware LSTMs for image	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Image captioning; Transformer framework; Gate-controlled geometry attention; Position-aware LSTM		In recent years, Transformer structures have been widely applied in image captioning with impressive performance. However, previous works often neglect the geometry and position relations of different visual objects. These relations are often thought of as crucial information for good captioning results. Aiming to further promote the image captioning by Transformers, this paper proposes an improved Geometry Attention Transformer (GAT) framework. In order to obtain geometric representation ability, two novel geometry-aware architectures are designed respectively for the encoder and decoder in our GAT by i) a geometry gate controlled self-attention refiner, and ii) a group of position-LSTMs. The first one explicitly incorporates relative spatial information into the image representations in encoding steps, and the second one precisely informs the decoder of relative word positions for generating caption texts. The image representations and spatial information are extracted by a pretrained Faster-RCNN network. Our ablation study has proved that these two designed optimization modules could efficiently improve the performance of image captioning. The experiment comparisons on the datasets MS COCO and Flickr30K, also show that our GAT could often outperform current state-of-the-art image captioning models.

Recently, fear of vaccine side effects created widespread concern and paused global vaccination efforts. Many studies find that how medical risks are framed and communicated can influence individuals' perceptions and behavior, yet there is little evidence on how the communication of COVID-19 vaccine side-effect risks influences vaccine intentions. The primary objective of our study is to evaluate how the framing of vaccine-side effect risks impacts individuals' vaccine intentions and perceptions of vaccine safety. The study will assess the impact of 3 dimensions of side-effect framing: 1. Qualitative risk labels: Determine whether attaching a qualitative risk label (e.g. adding "very low risk" next to the actual numerical risk) impacts individuals' willingness to take a vaccine and their perceptions of its safety. 2. Comparison groups: Determine how framing side-effect risks in comparison to other causes of mortality (COVID-19 mortality and motor vehicle mortality) impacts individuals' willingness to take a vaccine and their perceptions of its safety. 3. How the comparison risks are presented: Determine whether comparisons to other causes of mortality are presented on an absolute or relative scale impacts individuals' willingness to take a vaccine and their perceptions of its safety. Secondarily, we will also randomize a subset of individuals to receive the "status-quo" framing, where the vaccine side-effect risks are presented like how they were presented in the media. We will then compare vaccine intentions and perceptions of vaccine safety between the status-quo and the pooled intervention group samples to provide some insight into how "harmful" the status-quo framing was. Ultimately, we believe that our results will provide the some of the first experimental evidence on how the communication of COVID-19 vaccine risks may impact the public's willingness to be vaccinated and can inform future efforts to increase vaccination rates. Trial design: Our study is an online-based randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effect of different vaccine side-effect framings on COVID-19 vaccine intentions and perceived safety for a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Using a factorial design, we will experimentally assess the impact of 3 risk framing strategies, varying whether the risk is presented: (1) with a qualitative label, (2) whether the risk is presented with a comparison risk, and (3) for comparison cases, whether the comparison is in absolute or relative terms. We will also randomize a portion of respondents to a status quo framing where the side effect risk mimics the media's communication in early April 2021. Participants: This will be an online study setting. We will use Prolific to recruit participants and host our study on the Gorilla platform. To be eligible, participants must be 18 years old or over (male, female, or other), have current residence in the US or UK, and be able to speak English. Participants will be excluded from the study if they do not meet our inclusion criteria. Intervention and comparator: Our study content will consist of five pages presented to individuals online. Page 1 will explain the purpose of the study and contain the consent information. Page 2 will contain basic sociodemographic questions, including participants' age, sex, and schooling level. Page 3 will set up the experiment by telling individuals that we will describe a hypothetical new COVID-19 vaccine and that we would like to know how likely they would be to take the vaccine and how safe they think the vaccine is. On this page, we will also encourage individuals to respond truthfully and remind them that their answers are confidential and cannot be linked back to any personal identifying information. Page 4 will be the main experimental slide, where we will present individuals with information on the vaccine, varying how the vaccination risk is communicated based on which experimental framing arm they are randomized to. We will factorially randomize across the following factors in the following order (separately by country). First, we will determine whether individuals are randomized to the status quo framing, or the intervention framings (1500 respondents to the status quo, and 4500 to the intervention). Among those randomized to the intervention framing, we will randomize (equal allocation) whether the side effect is presented without a comparison, with a comparison to COVID-19 mortality, or with a comparison to motor vehicle mortality. We will then factorially randomize (equal allocation) whether the risk is presented with a qualitative risk label or not (e.g. "very low risk"). To ensure that the factors are independent of one another, we will do this by randomizing individuals to the risk labels within strata of the comparison group factor. Lastly, among those randomized to the comparison group, we will factorially randomize whether the risk is presented as an absolute or relative comparison. As previously, we will ensure independence by doing this randomization within strata of comparison group*risk labelling. This entire design is visualized in the full protocol. The experimental text for each arm is: Arm 1: With regards to side effects, so far 8 individuals have developed potentially life-threatening blood clots. This is among the approximately 7 million adults that have received the vaccine so far. Arm 2: With regards to side effects, 1 out of 100,000 vaccinated individuals may develop serious blood clots.

Arm 8: - Text for USA participants: With regards to side effects, 1 out of 100,000 vaccinated individuals may develop serious blood clots. As a reference, 12 out of every 100,000 Americans died in a motor vehicle accident based on data from the past year. - Text for UK participants: With regards to side effects, 1 out of 100,000 vaccinated individuals may develop serious blood clots. As a reference, 2.6 out of every 100,000 individuals in the UK died in a motor vehicle accident based on data from the past year. Arm 9: - Text for USA participants: With regards to side effects, 1 out of 100,000 vaccinated individuals may develop serious blood clots.

As a reference, this is almost 1/4th of the risk of dying in a motor vehicle accident based on data from the past year. Arm 10: - Text for USA participants: With regards to side effects, 1 out of 100,000 vaccinated individuals may develop serious blood clots (very low risk). As a reference, 12 out of every 100,000 Americans died in a motor vehicle accident based on data from the past year. - Text for UK participants: With regards to side effects, 1 out of 100,000 vaccinated individuals may develop serious blood clots (very low risk). As a reference, 2.6 out of every 100,000 individuals in the UK died in a motor vehicle accident based on data from the past year. Arm 11: - Text for USA participants: With regards to side effects, 1 out of 100,000 vaccinated individuals may develop serious blood clots (very low risk). As a reference, this is 1/12th of the risk of dying in a motor vehicle accident based on data from the past year. - Text for UK participants: With regards to side effects, 1 out of 100,000 vaccinated individuals may develop serious blood clots (very low risk). As a reference, this is nearly 1/4th of the risk of dying in a motor vehicle accident based on data from the past year. The risk information will be presented on a single page along with the two main outcome questions. Lastly, for individuals that reported that they are unlikely or unsure about whether they would take the vaccine, the final page will ask them their reason (question based on a recently published study of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy). Main outcomes: Our primary outcome is individuals' willingness to take the hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. We will measure this outcome by asking, "How likely would you be to take this vaccine?" allowing individuals to choose from a four-point Likert response of "Unlikely, Unsure leaning towards unlikely, Unsure leaning towards likely, Very likely." This outcome variable, including the categories and phrasing, is based on a recently published study on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy conducted by researchers with the Vaccine Hesitance Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Our secondary outcome is individuals' perceived safety of the vaccine. We will assess this outcome by asking individuals, "How safe do you feel this vaccine is?" allowing them to choose answers ranging from 1-10 where 1 is extremely unsafe, and 10 is extremely safe. Both outcomes will be measured at the time of the questionnaire. Participants can take up to 45 min to complete the questions but will not be able to go back and change their responses after submitting their questionnaire. Randomization: Using a web-based randomization algorithm, Gorilla will randomly allocate participants to each of the experimental arms. Gorilla allows for two randomization options - independent randomization of each individual based on a probability draw and balanced randomization, which randomizes without replacement such that among groups of respondents a fixed proportion will end up in each experimental arm. We will use the "balanced randomization" option to ensure that our experimental arms are balanced. Participants will be randomized based on the allocations described above. Blinding: Because Prolific handles the interaction between the study investigators and participants, the participants will be completely anonymous to the study investigators. The outcome measures will be self-reported and submitted anonymously. All persons in the study team will be blinded to the group allocation. Numbers to be randomized: We will randomize 6000 participants per country for a total sample of 12000 individuals. Trial status: The protocol version number is 1.0 and the date is July 14, 2021.

Neuron as a basic information processing unit builds the biological neural network, and the realization of information transmission and integration depends on the synaptic connection between neurons. This information transfer and integration work is difficult to realize by relying on von Neumann computer, due to the computer only works according to the well-defined programs. To further simulate the imagery thinking of human brain neural network, the researchers begin with the information memory and processing mechanism of human brain neural network. A large number of microelectronic devices with human thinking characteristics are designed, such as memristor, atomic switch, phase change memory, and transistors. The oxide-based thin film transistor under the new material system is one of these devices, and has attracted the attention of researchers. The transistors working as the biological synapses, the gate electrode is regard as presynaptic input terminal, and the channel current is measured as postsynaptic output. Utilizing the proton gating behaviors, a series of synaptic behaviors, such as short-term and long-term memory, paired-pulse facilitation, and spike timing-dependent plasticity is mimicked successfully in these synaptic transistors. With the progressing of science and technology, and the increasing of requirements for environmental protection, researchers pay more attention to the environmentally friendly solid electrolyte materials to fabricate oxide-based thin film synaptic transistor. Researchers have a major interest in starch, due to the low price, rich source, and excellent mechanical properties. Starch can be extracted from corn, potato, sweet potato and other starch-containing substances, and is generally insoluble in cold water, and gelatinized in boiling water. In this study, corn starch solid electrolyte is prepared on ITO glass by spin coating progress, and dried at a constant temperature at 30 degrees C. The electrical performances of protonic/electronic hybrid IZO synaptic transistor gated by corn starch solid electrolyte are excellent, operation voltage, I-on/(off) ratio, field-effect mobility and subthreshold swing are 1.5 V, 1 x 10(7), 18.7 cm(2) .V-1.s(-1) and 156.8 mV/dec., respectively. Due to the mobile proton migrating in corn starch solid electrolyte, the paired-pulse facilitation, learning and memory behaviors and high-pass filter of biological neural synaptic plasticity are realized successfully. The synaptic transistors have potential applications in the field of environment-friendly microelectronic devices to reduce the production costs. Therefore, the corn starch solid electrolyte gated proton/electron hybrid synaptic transistor as an artificial synapse can offer a suitable option to building the neural network.

Three maleness factors are thought to function on the Y chromosome, gynoecium suppression factor (GSF), stamen-promoting factor (SPF), and male fertility factor (MFF), and their deletions result in hermaphrodites, anther defects, and pollen defects, respectively. Although a framework map of the Y chromosome exists, the sex determination genes have not been identified, and no markers close enough to potentially be used for BAC library screening are yet available. The analysis of Y deletion mutants by Y-chromosome-specific STS markers is an efficient way to isolate sex determination regions, but more Y-specific STS markers are needed to accelerate the exploration of sex determination factors. Herein, we report a marker design method that uses simple sequence repeats, which is especially effective on the Y chromosome of S. latifolia because it contains many simple sequence repeats. Six new Y-chromosome-specific STS markers were obtained, SmicSy1-6. These were used to detect relatively small Y deletion sites in heavy-ion beam irradiation-induced mutants. The mapping of male sex determination regions was narrowed down by using more markers and smaller-sized Y deletion mutants. One new marker, SmicSy6, is a proximal marker to SPF and, thus, a second index for SPF. The region including SPF is thought to be located between two SPF proximal markers. The flower phenotype correlates with the deletion size of SPF using SPF proximal markers. These findings represent new progress in isolating the sex determination factor, which has been studied for more than 50 years.

The worthiness of using information on land-use-land-cover in watershed models for Western Ghats: A case study	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE			English	Article						Curve number method; variable source area theory; streamflow components; influence of LULC; curve number and contributing area	RUNOFF PROCESSES	The variable source area (VSA) theory of runoff generation mechanisms has been proved to hold good in many wet mountainous areas, decades ago. According to this theory, infiltration-excess overland flow is limited to very small areas in mountainous and forested catchments. But, the perception that the land surface characteristics, including land-use-land-cover (LULC), form the major factors influencing the response of the catchment to rainfall has dominated the thought in hydrology to such an extent that models based on the overland flow theory continue to be used even in such areas. The present study was taken up in order to understand the worthiness of using parameters, including the curve number (CN), that are based on the physiographic characteristics of the catchment in a watershed model designed to estimate runoff in the wet mountainous areas of the Western Ghats in southern India, where the VSA theory has been proved to hold good. The study has been accomplished by applying the NITK model developed for estimating runoff using daily rainfall data. This model is believed to estimate reliably the streamflow in the region using parameter values that can be computed from catchment characteristics. In the present study, it is applied on three gauged streams in the region of Western Ghats in Karnataka. Initially, the performance of the model has been studied with the parameters fixed using the catchment characteristics. Later, the model has been used as a tool to test hypotheses concerning the catchment response, by varying the parameter values, adopting a trial and error procedure. Initial results showed that the model performance is poor as the coefficients of efficiency vary between -66.9 and 82%. The sensitivity analysis carried out subsequently showed that the model parameters are required to be altered greatly for good performance and that the model simulations are not sensitive to the parameter CN. Further, the performance of this model was compared with that of a VSA model, known to suit the region well. This showed that even after all the changes in the model parameters, the model results are not highly reliable. Hence, in order to understand the reasons for the poor performance of the model, a technique was developed to compute the CN values that would be actually necessary to simulate daily direct runoff (DRO) reliably in this method, the daily values of CN are computed by applying backwards the expression for runoff on the DRO estimated by the VSA model. The variations in the values of CN computed using this method are then studied. It is found that the variations in daily CN are high and highly random too, whereas the NITK model uses only three fixed values of CN. It is thus concluded that factors other than those on which the CN is popularly believed to depend control the runoff generation in the region and that influence of LULC on runoff is not discernible at all from the kind of data that is commonly available.

Assessment of Process Skills in Analytical Chemistry Student Responses to Open-Ended Exam Questions	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Upper-Division Undergraduate; Analytical Chemistry; Chemical Education Research; Testing/Assessment	PERFORMANCE; EXPECTATIONS; SCIENCE	Assessment, including course exams, clearly indicates to students what learning goals they are expected to master in a certain course. However, most of these assessments tend to focus on generating a correct answer rather than on the type of reasoning or skills used to arrive at the answer. If educators value skills in addition to the correctness of an answer, it is important that they assess them. As part of the ANA-POGIL (analytical process oriented guided inquiry learning) project, the ANA-POGIL team developed a set of process-rich or guided-inquiry-type assessment questions to be used on exams. These questions were designed to mirror the structure of the POGIL activities, where students were provided data in the form of a table, graph, or set of information with the intention of eliciting evidence of process skills such as information processing, problem solving, and critical thinking in the students' written responses. This study presents an analysis of student responses gathered from multiple institutions over several semesters to determine characteristics of questions that are likely to elicit evidence of process skills. Results of this project can provide some insight and recommendations to instructors about how to construct questions to elicit evidence of desired skills.

The effect of training methodology on knowledge representation in categorization	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INFORMATION-INTEGRATION; CATEGORY; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEMS; RULES; IDENTIFICATION; ATTENTION; IMPLICIT; EXPLICIT	Category representations can be broadly classified as containing within-category information or between-category information. Although such representational differences can have a profound impact on decision-making, relatively little is known about the factors contributing to the development and generalizability of different types of category representations. These issues are addressed by investigating the impact of training methodology and category structures using a traditional empirical approach as well as the novel adaptation of computational modeling techniques from the machine learning literature. Experiment 1 focused on rule-based (RB) category structures thought to promote between-category representations. Participants learned two sets of two categories during training and were subsequently tested on a novel categorization problem using the training categories. Classification training resulted in a bias toward between-category representations whereas concept training resulted in a bias toward within-category representations. Experiment 2 focused on information-integration (II) category structures thought to promote within- category representations. With II structures, there was a bias toward within-category representations regardless of training methodology. Furthermore, in both experiments, computational modeling suggests that only within-category representations could support generalization during the test phase. These data suggest that within-category representations may be dominant and more robust for supporting the reconfiguration of current knowledge to support generalization.

An Online Hand Exercise Intervention for Adults With Rheumatoid Arthritis (mySARAH): Design, Development, and Usability Testing	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						rheumatoid arthritis; hand joints; exercise training; web-based	SARAH	Background: The Strengthening and Stretching for Rheumatoid Arthritis of the Hand (SARAH) program is a tailored, progressive 12-week exercise program for people with hand problems due to rheumatoid arthritis. The program was shown to be clinically and cost-effective in a large clinical trial and is recommended by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for rheumatoid arthritis in adults. Objective: We have developed an online version of the SARAH program (mySARAH) to make the SARAH program widely accessible to people with rheumatoid arthritis. The purposes of this study were to develop mySARAH and to evaluate and address its usability issues. Methods: We developed mySARAH using a three-step process and gaining feedback from patient contributors. After initial development, mySARAH was tested in two iterative usability cycles in nine participants using a simplified think-aloud protocol and self-reported questionnaires. We also evaluated if participants executed the SARAH exercises correctly after watching the exercise videos included on the website. Results: A preliminary version of mySARAH consisting of six sessions over a 12-week period and delivered via text, exercise videos, images, exercise plan form, exercise calendar, and links to additional information on rheumatoid arthritis was developed. Five participants (1 male; 4 females; median age 64 years) and four participants (four females; median age 64.5 years) took part in the first and second usability testing cycles respectively. Usability issues identified from Cycle 1 such as having a navigation tutorial video and individualised feedback on pain levels were addressed prior to Cycle 2. The need for more instructions to complete the mySARAH patient forms was identified in Cycle 2 and was rectified. Self-reports from both cycles indicated that participants found the program useful and easy to use and were confident in performing the SARAH exercises themselves. Eight of the nine participants correctly demonstrated all the exercises. Conclusions: mySARAH is the first online hand exercise intervention for people with rheumatoid arthritis. We actively involved target users in the development and usability evaluation and ensured mySARAH met their needs and preferences.

Adaptive reliance on the most stable sensory predictions enhances perceptual feature extraction of moving stimuli	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						forward model; motor control; motor learning; perception; sensory predictions	PRIOR EXPECTATIONS; MOTION PERCEPTION; CONSEQUENCES; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; ADAPTATION; BRAIN; REPRESENTATIONS; ATTENTION; TRACKING	The prediction of the sensory outcomes of action is thought to be useful for distinguishing self-vs. externally generated sensations, correcting movements when sensory feedback is delayed, and learning predictive models for motor behavior. Here, we show that aspects of another fundamental function-perception-are enhanced when they entail the contribution of predicted sensory outcomes and that this enhancement relies on the adaptive use of the most stable predictions available. We combined a motor-learning paradigm that imposes new sensory predictions with a dynamic visual search task to first show that perceptual feature extraction of a moving stimulus is poorer when it is based on sensory feedback that is misaligned with those predictions. This was possible because our novel experimental design allowed us to override the "natural" sensory predictions present when any action is performed and separately examine the influence of these two sources on perceptual feature extraction. We then show that if the new predictions induced via motor learning are unreliable, rather than just relying on sensory information for perceptual judgments, as is conventionally thought, then subjects adaptively transition to using other stable sensory predictions to maintain greater accuracy in their perceptual judgments. Finally, we show that when sensory predictions are not modified at all, these judgments are sharper when subjects combine their natural predictions with sensory feedback. Collectively, our results highlight the crucial contribution of sensory predictions to perception and also suggest that the brain intelligently integrates the most stable predictions available with sensory information to maintain high fidelity in perceptual decisions.

These sagacious frameworks will assist in analyzing trends and reaching out to pre-existing setups with different degrees of expertise. Design/methodology/approach-A systematic overview is provided in this paper to unify insights and competencies toward building SCs; a hybrid analytical approach is used consisting of machine learning and bibliometric analysis. Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) are the primary databases for this purpose. Findings-SCs implement cutting-edge technologies to enhance mobility, elevating information and communication technology (ICT) skills and data awareness while improving business processes and efficiency. This system of SC is an evolution of the conventional method. It provides a foundation for intelligent community services based on individual users and technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, cloud computing and big data. Manufacturing-based, service-based, retail-based, resource management and infrastructure-based SCs exist in the literature. Originality/value-The paper summarizes a conceptual framework of SCs based on existing works around SCs. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review that uses a hybrid approach of topic modeling and bibliometric analysis to understand SCs better.

This brief essay discusses several psychological mechanisms which, under certain conditions, lead people to ignore important sources of information and hinder effective management of the epidemic. The paper shows that understanding psychological mechanisms, such as information neglect, cognitive dissonance, psychological reactance, and, in general, the diversity of people's thinking styles, may help leaders design more effective government communications.

J	Yu, CM; Tsou, YT; Lu, CS; Kuo, SY				Yu, Chia-Mu; Tsou, Yao-Tung; Lu, Chun-Shien; Kuo, Sy-Yen			Constrained Function-Based Message Authentication for Sensor Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Authentication; en-route filtering; security; sensor networks	SECURITY; MECHANISMS; WATERMARK; COVERAGE; ATTACKS; SCHEME; DESIGN	Sensor networks are vulnerable to false data injection attack and path-based denial of service (PDoS) attack. While conventional authentication schemes are insufficient for solving these security conflicts, an en-route filtering scheme, enabling each forwarding node to check the authenticity of the received message, acts as a defense against these two attacks. To construct an efficient en-route filtering scheme, this paper first presents a Constrained Function-based message Authentication (CFA) scheme, which can be thought of as a hash function directly supporting the en-route filtering functionality. Obviously, the crux of the scheme lies on the design of guaranteeing each sensor to have en-route filtering capability. Together with the redundancy property of sensor networks, which means that an event can be simultaneously observed by multiple sensor nodes, the devised CFA scheme is used to construct a CFA-based en-route filtering (CFAEF) scheme. In addition to the resilience against false data injection and PDoS attacks, CFAEF is inherently resilient against false endorsement-based DoS attack. In contrast to most of the existing methods, which rely on complicated security associations among sensor nodes, our design, which directly exploits an en-route filtering hash function, appears to be novel. We examine the CFA and CFAEF schemes from both the theoretical and numerical aspects to demonstrate their efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, prototype implementation on TelosB mote demonstrates the practicality of our proposed method.

Economic reasoning and artificial intelligence	SCIENCE			English	Review							CHALLENGE; AUCTIONS; GAMES	The field of artificial intelligence (AI) strives to build rational agents capable of perceiving the world around them and taking actions to advance specified goals. Put another way, AI researchers aim to construct a synthetic homo economicus, the mythical perfectly rational agent of neoclassical economics. We review progress toward creating this new species of machine, machina economicus, and discuss some challenges in designing AIs that can reason effectively in economic contexts. Supposing that AI succeeds in this quest, or at least comes close enough that it is useful to think about AIs in rationalistic terms, we ask how to design the rules of interaction in multi-agent systems that come to represent an economy of AIs. Theories of normative design from economics may prove more relevant for artificial agents than human agents, with AIs that better respect idealized assumptions of rationality than people, interacting through novel rules and incentive systems quite distinct from those tailored for people.

Generative AI models have garnered significant attention for their potential in educational settings, but image-generative AI models need to be more utilized. This study explores the potential of integrating generative AI, specifically Stable Diffusion, into art-focused STEAM classes. To this end, we combined STEAM education with image-generative AI. We designed and implemented a learning activity in which students used image-generative AI to generate creative images and wrote imaginative diaries inspired by AI-generated pictures. Using a mixed-methods approach, we collected and analyzed data from surveys, interviews, and prompt datasets to gain insights into students' perceptions, motivations, and behaviors concerning the integration of generative AI in art education. Our study found that incorporating generative AI into art-focused STEAM classes may reduce the gap between male and female students' interest in art practices. We also found that the number of subjects in students' prompt datasets is linked to their divergent and convergent thinking. Finally, we discovered a meaningful correlation between the number of unique words in students' diaries and the image scores that researchers assessed. Our findings shed light on the relationship between students' divergent and convergent behaviors, offering valuable insights into their creative thinking processes. This study underscores the potential of integrating image-generative AI models in STEAM education.

Besides, the 3D game development is a difficult and complex learning process. Within this context, it was decided that teaching should be restructured to support the metacognitive strategies' use skills of students. SOLO taxonomy was used as a framework for restructuring the content of teaching. In the literature, SOLO is preferred as a solution for teaching contents, which is complex and challenging to learn. The aim of this study is to improve problem-solving skills (PSS), cognitive flexibility, meta-cognitive strategies use skills and spatial anxiety in teaching the 3D game development, supported with metacognitive strategies and restructured with SOLO. An embedded pattern is used in this study. This study showed that experimental intervention influences change in students' PSS and metacognitive strategies use skills. It is necessary to include SOLO taxonomy in content planning to increase the learning performance. It is supposed that the study results will provide an insight for implementers to design and execute difficult and complex teaching in computer science education and will assist them in developing different perspectives.

Over 4 months, students in 85 middle schools read a novel addressing mental health and violence-related themes. As a collaboration between a public school district and public library system, the program's classroom activities emphasized dialogue, while coordinated library events supported community engagement. Students completed pre/postsurveys (total n = 1487); school program leaders (n = 39) and public librarians (n = 14) completed postsurveys. Half of student respondents reported personal encounters with violence. Most said the novel influenced their thinking; students with personal experiences of violence reported greater influence than those without. Highest rates of dialogue were seen among students who read the novel in full, and over half of postsurvey respondents wanted more dialogue opportunities. Leaders and librarians indicated that the program was smoothly integrated with existing curricula, but also offered recommendations for improved processes. Findings suggest that this intervention was effective at stimulating dialogue while providing assets-based opportunities for youth to share experiences and concerns. Current program processes indicate promise for further engagement and impact, with some modifications. To this end, authors draw upon evaluation findings and youth development literature to offer recommendations for program development and replication in other regions.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the aim of comprehensively revealing the occurrence of ICH in patients with CADASIL. Methods English-language studies published up to September 30, 2021 were searched for in the MEDLINE (PubMed), Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. The design, patient characteristics, occurrence rate of ICH, and associated risk factors were retrieved for each identified relevant study. Results We enrolled 13 studies in the final meta-analysis, which included 1,310 patients with CADASIL. The probability of ICH occurrence in patients with CADASIL was 10.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]=5.6%-18.0%, I-2=85.1%). When stratified by geographic region, the occurrence rate of ICH was much higher in Asians (17.7%; 95% CI=11.0%-28.5%, I-2=76.3%) than in Europeans (2.0%; 95% CI=0.4%-10.8%, I-2=82.8%). A higher burden of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and a history of hypertension were the most commonly recorded risk factors for ICH, which were available for three and two of the included studies, respectively. Conclusions Our study suggests that ICH is an important clinical manifestation of CADASIL, especially in Asians. A higher burden of CMBs and the existence of hypertension were found to be associated with a higher probability of ICH occurrence in patients with CADASIL.

Exploring attention on a retailer's homepage: an eye-tracking & qualitative research study	BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Eye-tracking; attention; website design; retail; homepage; qualitative	BOTTOM-UP; MOTIVATIONS; REVIEWS; PRODUCT; SEARCH; DESIGN; TASK	This article explores why some areas of a retailer's homepage receive more attention than others. An eye-tracking study followed by retrospective think-aloud protocols and qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 52 females (aged 20-70). Findings revealed the visual hierarchy of a retail homepage: 1. Rotating Banner, 2. Main Menu Bar, 3. Left drop-down menu, 4. Static images below banner, 5. Search bar. Qualitative data revealed that some features attracted attention due to them being useful, serving a functional purpose (menu bars, search bar), or due to them being interesting (static banner images) but others did so inadvertently because they were distracting and irritating (rotating banner). This shows that attention can be due to both positive and negative factors. This article contributes to knowledge by providing a rich interpretation of eye-tracking data and attention on a retail homepage, showing the interplay between top-down and bottom-up attention on a user's shopping journey. This is valuable for future academic research as well as practitioners. This study also highlights the importance of using live websites for research to increase ecological validity.

While existing approaches are mainly blackbox based, showing aggregated visualisations as one-size-fits-all nudges, personalisation turned out promising to enhance the efficacy of nudges within the high variance of users and contexts. This article presents a disaggregated whitebox-based visualisation of critical information as a novel nudge. By segmenting users according to their decision-making and information processing styles, we investigate if the novel nudge is more effective for specific users than a common black-box nudge. Based on existing literature about critical factors in password security, we designed a dynamic radar chart and parallel coordinates as disaggregated visualisations. We evaluated the short-term effectiveness and users' perception of the nudges in a think-aloud prestudy and a representative online evaluation (N=1.012). Our findings suggest that dynamic radar charts present a moderately effective nudge towards stronger passwords regarding short-term efficacy and are appreciated particularly by players of role-playing games.

The human gene is transcribed into major (3.0 and 2.5 kb) and minor (2.2/2.0 kb) transcripts, as seen in Northern blot assays. We investigated the possibility that other transcripts, not detectable by Northern blot, were synthesized as either coding or regulatory RNAs that would modulate collagenase-3 expression and function/activity. Design: We screened a cDNA library and total RNA from human chondrocytes by plaque hybridization and RT-PCR, and expressed the transcripts in a cellular environment. The levels of expression of each transcript in normal and osteoarthritic joint cells and cartilage were monitored by RT-PCR. Results: We identified five different collagenase-3 RNA species derived from alternative polyadenylation sites (COL3-APS), internal deletion (COL3-DEL), alternative splicing (COL3-9B/COL3-9B-2), and different transcription initiation site (COL3-ATS and COL3-ATS-INT). Each transcript could be translated in a cellular environment. Interestingly, the proteins translated from the COL3-DEL and COL3-9B-2 transcripts had a modified hemopexin-like domain, suggesting altered collagenolytic activities. The transcript types COL3-APS, COI-3-9B-2, and COL3-ATS were up-regulated in the osteoarthritic samples and expressed in the chondrosarcoma cell line SW1353. Conclusion: Our data show that the human collagenase-3 gene is subjected to different levels of regulation and constitutes a more complex system than was originally thought.

This study used the GAME model (gamification, assessment, modeling, and enquiry) in a programming education course to enhance undergraduates' self-efficacy and performance of basic programming concepts. There were 83 undergraduates taking part in this study, which adopted a quasi-experimental research design. Students in the experimental group (n = 43) experienced a course in which the GAME model was used to design the block-based programming course. The control group (n = 40) was given a general information education course covering similar learning concepts without the game-based learning strategy. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was adopted to investigate the effect of the GAME model on students' learning outcomes for the quantitative data. In the qualitative analysis, students' responses to the course perception questionnaire were coded and analyzed. The results showed that students in the experimental group outperformed their counterparts regarding self-efficacy and basic programming concepts. The experimental treatment resulted in a small to medium effect size difference between the two groups. The results showed that incorporating the GAME model into block-based programming teaching helped improve undergraduates' self-efficacy and performance of basic programming concepts. In addition, these experimental group undergraduates also perceived the pedagogic GAME model positively. Several research suggestions are proposed based on the findings of the present study.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, might be closely linked with benign prostate hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms (BPH/LUTS). Several studies have been conducted regarding NAFLD and BPH/LUTS association. However, the results are yet to reach a clear conclusion. We aimed to gather these studies' results to make a more robust analysis through a systematic review and meta-analysis.Methods: We systematically searched Pubmed-Medline, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct databases. We excluded all experimental studies, case reports, and reviews. Our search was restricted to the English language. We used standard mean difference for BPH/LUTS-related parameters. We identified the study qualities by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We conducted a publication bias analysis.Results: A total of six studies involving 7089 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Our meta-analysis revealed that patients with NAFLD have larger prostate volume [0.553 (0.303-0.802), P < 0.001; Q = 97.41; P-value for heterogeneity = P < 0.0001; I-2 = 94.86%]. However, the summary effect size of the other parameters of BPH/LUTS (prostate-specific antigen and international prostate symptom score) computed in our meta-analysis did not yield significant results.Conclusions: The prostate size was larger in patients with NAFLD, but the meta-analysis did not reach a significant result for LUTS among the studies. These results should be tested with well-designed studies, in particular, to clarify the association of LUTS with NAFLD.

J	Kuttarl, SK; Sarma, A; Rothermel, G; Wang, ZD				Kuttarl, Sandeep Kaur; Sarma, Anita; Rothermel, Gregg; Wang, Zhendong			What happened to my application? Helping end users comprehend evolution through variation management	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						End-user programming; End-user software engineering; App inventor; Variation management	SOFTWARE; VARIABILITY; SYSTEM; CODE	Context: Millions of end users are creating software applications. These end users typically do not have clear requirements in mind; instead, they debug their programs into existence and reuse their own or other persons' code. These behaviors often result in the creation of numerous variants of programs. Current end-user programming environments do not provide support for managing such variants. Objective: We wish to understand the variant creation behavior of end user programmers. Based on this understanding we wish to develop an automated system to help end user programmers efficiently manage variants. Method: We conducted an on-line survey to understand when and how end-user programmers create program variants and how they manage them. Our 124 survey respondents were recruited via email from among non computer science majors who had taken at least one course in the computer science department at our university; the respondents were involved in the Engineering, Sciences, Arts, and Management fields. Based on the results of this survey we identified a set of design requirements for providing variation management support for end users. We implemented variation management support in App Inventor - a drag and drop programming environment for creating mobile applications. Our support, AppinventorHelper, is meant to help end-user programmers visualize the provenance of and relationships among variants. We conducted a think-aloud study with 10 participants to evaluate the usability of AppinventorHelper. The participants were selected on a first come, first-served basis from those who responded to our recruitment email sent to list-servers. They were all end users majoring in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, or physics. None had formal training in software engineering methods, but all had some experience with visual programming languages. Results: Our (user study) results indicate that AppinventorHelper can help end users navigate through variants and find variants that could be utilized cost-effectively as examples or actual code upon which to build new applications. For example, in one of our empirical studies end users explored variants of a paint application in order to find a variant that could easily be extended to incorporate a new feature. Conclusions: Our survey results show that end users do indeed reuse program variants and suggest that understanding the differences between variants is important. Further, end users prefer running code and looking at outputs, accessing source code and meta information such as filenames, referring to the creation and update dates of programs, and having information on the authors of code. When selecting variants users prefer to look at their major features such as correctness, similarity and authorship information. End users rely primarily on memory to track changes. They seldom make use of online or configuration management tools. Hence, integrated domain-specific variation management tools like AppInventorHelper can significantly help improve users' interactions with the system. A key contribution of our work is a set of design requirements for end-user programming environments that facilitate the management and understanding of the provenance of program variants.

This study investigated the models of support groups preferred by Arab Australians living with chronic conditions. Two hundred fifty-one Arab people with chronic conditions completed a descriptive survey. More than half of participants thought that information on palliative care, financial advice and guidance, social and emotional support for self and family, complementary therapies, and being involved in treatment decisions were extremely useful. Conversely, information about palliative care, financial advice and guidance, and complementary therapies was seen as least useful. Eighty-five percent of participants reported willingness to attend a support program. Participants indicated they preferred the program to be held at a local community organization and facilitated by health care professionals. There was a high level of agreement in the views of Arab participants about the preferred location, type of facilitator, and content of a support program. These findings should inform the design of future programs for Arab immigrants with chronic conditions.

The use of technical methods, such as EEG and eye-tracking, has gradually become a research trend and hotspot in this field, in order to explore the deep cognitive states behind users' objective behaviors. This review outlines the applications of EEG and eye-tracking technology in the field of user research, with the aim of promoting future research and proposing reliable reference indicators and a research scope. It provides important reference information for other researchers in the field. The article summarizes the key reference indicators and research paradigms of EEG and eye-tracking in current user research, focusing on the user research situation in industrial products, digital interfaces and spatial environments. The limitations and research trends in current technological applications are also discussed. The feasibility of experimental equipment in outdoor environments, the long preparation time of EEG experimental equipment, and the accuracy error of physiological signal acquisition are currently existing problems. In the future, research on multi-sensory and behavioral interactions and universal studies of multiple technology fusions will be the next stage of research topics.

J	Abner, M; Baytar, F; Kreiner, D				Abner, Melissa; Baytar, Fatma; Kreiner, David			Applying the ESD approach in textile and apparel education	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						ESD; Ethical consumption; Sustainable apparel; Engaged learning; Sustainable attitudes	ENVIRONMENTAL KNOWLEDGE; BEHAVIOR; SUSTAINABILITY	Purpose The purpose of this study was to provide more information about the effectiveness of the Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) approach in textiles and apparel by applying it to a semester-long sustainability course. Design/methodology/approach A University-level course was re-designed using the ESD concepts. The course was taught from a consumer viewpoint using the product lifecycle as a focus, so the information was applicable to students' lives and multiple consumer products. Quantitative results of a pre- and post-test taken by students measured changes in knowledge, attitudes and behavior related to sustainability. Qualitative data from open-ended questions collected student feedback on instructional strategies. Findings A significant change in knowledge and attitudes were observed on the post-test. Students perceived assignments that required critical thinking, research and related to their lives as the most beneficial. Practical implications The ESD approach changed student knowledge and attitudes to be more sustainable. Assignments that included real world examples had the most impact on pro-environmental attitudes and support the use of a student-centered pedagogy. Originality/value This study is based on a semester-long sustainability course designed with ESD, while many existing studies are based on a single intervention or lesson. The results of this study add to the body of ESD literature in the textile and apparel area and are applicable to other disciplines.

J	Posten, AC; Mussweiler, T				Posten, Ann-Christin; Mussweiler, Thomas			That certain something! Focusing on similarities reduces judgmental uncertainty	COGNITION			English	Article						Similarity; Comparison; Judgment; Uncertainty	CONCEPTUAL COMBINATION; STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT; COMPARATIVE THINKING; ROUTINE STANDARDS; CONTRAST; ASSIMILATION; EFFICIENCY; FEATURES; COMMON	Comparative thinking is an efficient cognitive strategy that reduces judgmental uncertainty. However, comparisons may be conducted with a focus on similarities or differences. Similarity-focused comparisons seem to facilitate information-transfer, which has been suggested to drive the uncertainty reducing effect of comparisons. This implies that similarity-focused comparisons reduce uncertainty more than dissimilarity-focused comparisons. Two experiments examine this assumption. In Study 1, a similarity-focus (compared to a difference-focus and a neutral control condition) increased judgmental certainty when the comparison was based on confident standard-knowledge. However, when the comparison was based on vague standard-knowledge the uncertainty-reducing effect diminished. Study 2 shows that a similarity-focus increases information-transfer and that a similarity-focus particularly enhanced certainty for judgments for which a standard-to-target information-transfer had occurred. These studies suggest that similarity-focused comparisons reduce judgmental uncertainty through the mechanism of information-transfer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we present a conductance-based analog silicon synapse circuit suitable for the implementation of reduced or multi-compartment neuron models. Compartmental models are more bio-realistic. They are implemented in neuromorphic chips aiming to mimic the electrical activities of the neuronal networks in the brain and incorporate biomimetic soma and synapse circuits. Most contemporary low-power analog synapse circuits implement bioinspired "current-based" synaptic models suited for the implementation of single-compartment point neuron models. They emulate the exponential decay profile of the synaptic current, but ignore the effect of the postsynaptic membrane potential on the synaptic current. This dependence is necessary to emulate shunting inhibition, which is thought to play important roles in information processing in the brain. The proposed circuit uses an oscillator-based resistor-type element at its output stage to incorporate this effect. This circuit is used to demonstrate the shunting inhibition phenomenon. Next, to demonstrate that the oscillatory nature of the induced synaptic current has no unforeseen effects, the synapse circuit is employed in a spatiotemporal spike pattern detection task. The task employs the adaptive spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule, a bio-inspired learning rule introduced in a previous study. The mixed-signal chip is designed in a Taiwan Manufacturing Semiconductor Company 250 nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology node. It comprises a biomimetic soma circuit and 256 synapse circuits, along with their learning circuitries.

The Ohio Children's Opportunity Index (OCOI) is a composite area-level opportunity index comprised of eight health domains. Our research team has documented the design, development, and use cases of a dashboard solution to visualize OCOI. Methods The OCOI is a multidomain index spanning the following eight domains: (1) family stability, (2) infant health, (3) children's health, (4) access, (5) education, (6) housing, (7) environment, and (8) criminal justice. Information on these eight domains is derived from the American Community Survey and other administrative datasets. Our team used the Tableau Desktop visualization software and applied a user-centered design approach to developing the two OCOI dashboards-main OCOI dashboard and OCOI-race dashboard. We also performed convergence analysis to visualize the census tracts where different health indicators simultaneously exist at their worst levels. Results The OCOI dashboard has multiple, interactive components as follows: a choropleth map of Ohio displaying OCOI scores for a specific census tract, graphs presenting OCOI or domain scores to compare relative positions for tracts, and a sortable table to visualize scores for specific county and census tracts. A case study using the two dashboards for convergence analysis revealed census tracts in neighborhoods with low infant health scores and a high proportion of minority population. Conclusion The OCOI dashboards could assist health care leaders in making decisions that enhance health care delivery and policy decision-making regarding children's health particularly in areas where multiple health indicators exist at their worst levels.

Part I: Optimal Configurations for Nocturnal Convection Prediction Using Retrospective Cases	WEATHER AND FORECASTING			English	Article							PLANETARY BOUNDARY-LAYER; STORM-SCALE ANALYSES; WRF MODEL FORECASTS; WARM-SEASON; PRECIPITATION FORECASTS; KALMAN FILTER; UNITED-STATES; CLOUD MICROPHYSICS; RADAR OBSERVATIONS; SPRING EXPERIMENT	A real-time GSI-based and ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) and forecast system was implemented at the University of Oklahoma during the 2015 Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) experiment. Extensive experiments on the configuration of the cycled DA and on both the DA and forecast physics ensembles were conducted using retrospective cases to optimize the system design for nocturnal convection. The impacts of radar DA between 1200 and 1300 UTC, as well as the frequency and number of DA cycles and the DA physics configuration, extend through the following night. Ten-minute cycling of radar DA leads to more skillful forecasts than both more and less frequent cycling. The Thompson microphysics scheme for DA better analyzes the effects of morning convection on environmental moisture than WSM6, which improves the convection forecast the following night. A multi-PBL configuration during DA leads to less skillful shortterm forecasts than even a relatively poorly performing single-PBL scheme. Deterministic and ensemble forecast physics configurations are also evaluated. Thompson microphysics and the Mellor-YamadaNakanishi- Niino (MYNN) PBL provide the most skillful nocturnal precipitation forecasts. A well thought out multiphysics configuration is shown to provide advantages over evenly distributing three of the bestperforming microphysics and PBL schemes or a fixed MYNN/Thompson ensemble. This is shown using objective and subjective verification of precipitation and nonprecipitation variables, including convective initiation. Predictions of the low-level jet are sensitive to the PBL scheme, with the best scheme being variable and time dependent. These results guided the implementation and verification of a real-time ensemble DA and forecast system for PECAN.

Predicting novel substrates for enzymes with minimal experimental effort with active learning	METABOLIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Machine learning; Active learning; Enzyme promiscuity	CARBOXYLIC-ACID REDUCTASE; METABOLISM; SPECIFICITY; ANNOTATION; DESIGN	Enzymatic substrate promiscuity is more ubiquitous than previously thought, with significant consequences for understanding metabolism and its application to biocatalysis. This realization has given rise to the need for efficient characterization of enzyme promiscuity. Enzyme promiscuity is currently characterized with a limited number of human-selected compounds that may not be representative of the enzyme's versatility. While testing large numbers of compounds may be impractical, computational approaches can exploit existing data to determine the most informative substrates to test next, thereby more thoroughly exploring an enzyme's versatility. To demonstrate this, we used existing studies and tested compounds for four different enzymes, developed support vector machine (SVM) models using these datasets, and selected additional compounds for experiments using an active learning approach. SVMs trained on a chemically diverse set of compounds were discovered to achieve maximum accuracies of similar to 80% using similar to 33% fewer compounds than datasets based on all compounds tested in existing studies. Active learning-selected compounds for testing resolved apparent conflicts in the existing training data, while adding diversity to the dataset. The application of these algorithms to wide arrays of metabolic enzymes would result in a library of SVMs that can predict high-probability promiscuous enzymatic reactions and could prove a valuable resource for the design of novel metabolic pathways.

However, there is a lack of empirical research on factors influencing VR's supportive role from a user perspective, thus producing barriers to VR's advancement in planning practices. This neglect motivates the focus of this study, in which we adapt relevant PSS theory to build a conceptual framework that examines factors influencing VR performance in an experience-based environment. Empirical data are gathered predominantly through students' experiences with and evaluation of the "Viewing the Western Hills at Yinding Bridge" (Yinding Guanshan) VR Project-a VR system developed to optimize the view corridor of Beijing's Western Hills. The results show large variability in factors influencing VR performance. In general, the effects of six factors are significant, including 3D visualization, simulating real-world scenes, user-friendliness, interactivity, inspiring participants' enthusiasm, and inspiring creative thinking. These factors are attributed to the functionality, usability and innovativeness dimensions of VR systems. This study concludes that to realize the supportive and useful role of VR in planning, at minimum, these six factors should be explicitly taken into account.

Participants (10 physicians) were asked to perform a series of tasks involving entering prescriptions into the application from a medication list. The study procedure involved the collection of data consisting of transcripts of the subjects who were asked to "think aloud" white interacting with the prescription writing program to enter medications. All. user interactions with the device were video and audio recorded. Analysis of the protocols was conducted in two phases: (1) usability problems were identified from coding of the transcripts and video data, (2) actual errors in entering prescription data were also identified. The results indicated that there were a variety of usability problems, with most related to interface design issues. In examining the relationship between usability problems and errors, it was found that certain types of usability problems were closely associated with the occurrence of specific types of errors in prescription of medications. Implications for identifying and predicting technology-induced error are discussed in the context of improving the safety of health care information systems. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Liu, SL; Li, Y; Wang, XB; Zhang, XN; Wang, RS				Liu, Shuli; Li, Yong; Wang, Xiaobo; Zhang, Xuena; Wang, Renshu			Research on the Effect of Big Data Flipped Classroom Combined with Scenario Simulation Teaching: Based on Clinical Practice of Medical Students	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article							UNDERGRADUATE NURSING-STUDENTS; EDUCATION; SCIENCE	With the rapid development of information technology and the deepening of education reform, flipped classroom, as a new teaching mode, has received considerable attention from the education circle as soon as it appeared. This paper analyzes the teaching design principles of big data flipped classroom combined scenario simulation, constructs the teaching design model of big data flipped classroom combined scenario simulation in medical clinical practice, and explores the application and effect of the teaching method of big data flipped classroom combined scenario simulation. In this paper, the experimental group takes care of fusion simulations combined with the flipped classroom teaching method, and the routine control group uses the traditional teaching method; the scores of the two groups on theory, learning initiative, clinical practice, and critical thinking ability allow comparing the teaching effect, concluding that health care integration scenario simulation combined with flipped classroom teaching methods is new. It is beneficial to improve the learning ability, improve the ability of medical cooperation, enhance the sense of humanistic care, and so on. Analysis and comparison concludes that turning medical fusion simulations combined with classroom teaching, promoting the medical students on medical students' clinical practice to master theoretical knowledge and practical operation ability, and improving the ability of critical thinking ability and care will lead medical students to make a study of basic knowledge of medicine helping to cultivate the graduate student's study enthusiasm, stimulating interest in learning, improving the comprehensive quality of medical specialty, and making it worth popularizing in practice teaching.

J	Burges, SJ				Burges, Stephen J.			Invited perspective: Why I am an optimist	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							SMALL DRAINAGE BASINS; FLOW; IMPACT; PATTERNS; DESIGN; RADAR; SIZE	I address a range of topics that provide the sociopolitical-technological setting for my professional life. I discuss some influential features of post-World War II world geopolitics, landmark technological developments of that era, and the resulting follow-up technologies that have made it possible to approach various problems in hydrology and water resources. I next address societal needs that have driven developments in hydrology and water resources engineering and follow with a discussion of the modern foundations of our science and what I think are the principal issues in hydrology. I pose three community challenges that when accomplished should advance hydrologic science: data network needs for improving the water budgets at all scales, characterizing subsurface water flow paths, and the information archiving and mining needs from instruments that will generate substantially richer data detail than have been used for most hydrologic work to the present. I then discuss several hydrologic and water resource risk-based decision issues that matter to society to illustrate how such risks have been addressed successfully in the past. I conclude with a long-term community "grand challenge," the coupled modeling of the ocean-atmosphere-landform hydrologic cycle for the purpose of long-lead time hydrologic prediction.

J	Chen, S; Gu, Y; Wang, YB				Chen, Si; Gu, Yu; Wang, Yubo			The Impact of Digital Technology on the Reform of Art Teaching in the Wireless Network Environment	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article							WATER; GROWTH	With the development of computer and communication technologies, information technology in education has become fully popular, and computers, multimedia, and other teaching aids are widely used at all stages of school education. The development of learning styles follows the trajectory of digital to mobile and finally along the trajectory of ubiquitous learning (i.e., ubiquitous and available anywhere and anytime). Thus, in the context of information technology, university art education is facing the impact of foreign cultures, while the issue of national and global differences in university art education is becoming increasingly evident due to the influence of cultural pluralism. University art education has to realize the combination of nationalisation and modernisation in the informationised environment and build university art teaching content with humanistic and diverse content under the basic requirements of realism and practicality in art education. University art should innovate the education system, change the teaching methods, and improve the quality of teaching. In teaching, students are combined with the actual situation of students to cultivate their creative consciousness, innovative thinking, and innovative ability. On this basis, this article mainly studies and analyses the teaching methods and strategies of university art design under the wireless network teaching mode and focuses on the application methods and application effects of interactive teaching in art teaching. The comparative analysis shows that the introduction of WBRCCS-based formative assessment into inquiry-based teaching is significantly better than traditional inquiry-based teaching and that the WBRCCS-based formative assessment system can improve the effectiveness of inquiry-based teaching and enhances students' motivation to learn. This shows that the use of the WBRCCS assessment system can enhance students' understanding of science concepts and improve learning outcomes.

Landscape interpretation with augmented reality and maps to improve spatial orientation skill	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Augmented reality; landscape interpretation; spatial orientation; spatial skills; spatial thinking	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; ABILITIES; DISSOCIATION; PERSPECTIVE; GIS	Landscape interpretation is needed for navigating and determining an orientation: with traditional cartography, interpreting 3D topographic information from 2D landform representations to get self-location requires spatial orientation skill. Augmented reality technology allows a new way to interact with 3D landscape representation and thereby facilitate the orientation of oneself in respect to the environment to determine goal location. This paper analyses if AR spatial landform improves the learner's spatial orientation skill measured with the perspective taking/spatial orientation test by paired sampled t-tests. A workshop was conducted with 123 university students (63 treatment group, 60 control group) in which students had to identify locations and routes based on the interpretation of the relief, represented by AR. Results of the workshop showed an improvement in spatial orientation skill of 20.14 degrees average gain in the treatment group. Students who were not subject to the workshop (control group) did not improve their spatial orientation skill. The possibility of using free AR three-dimensional applications and exploit the potential of tablets and smart phones, which are widespread today, makes it possible to design and implement strategies for the development of spatial skills in formal teaching in the scope of Geography in higher education.

Based on a French experiment in the field of End-Stage Renal Diseases (ESRD), it has been thought of so as to be adapted to Chinese medical needs and administrative rules. It has been implemented for nephrology and rheumatology at the Rui Jin hospital in Shanghai, but its design and implementation have been guided by genericity in order to make easier its adaptation and extension to other diseases and other countries. The genericity aspects have been considered at the levels of events design, database design and production, and software design. This first experiment in China leads to some conclusions about the adaptability of the system to several diseases and the multilinguality of the interface and in medical terminologies.

In that time many changes have occured in how we think about making use of data gathered from users of technology to guide the process of designing and developing new hardware and software systems. Throughout this process there has been a productive dialog among academic and industry-based researchers and usability engineering practitioners. Academic research has provided insights into methods for understanding and modeling user behavior, and industry has provided a wide range of exciting technologies for consideration by researchers in HCI. This paper looks at the evolution of the field from the behavioral science perspective. We consider the evolution of the field within professional groups, such as the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (ACM SIGCHI) and the International Federation for Information Processing Technical Committee (IFIP TC13), academic departments (primarily in computer departments), and industry (primarily within IBM). In this paper we offer a view of this journey of 20 years, along with some visions and challenges of the future.

Nowadays, there are many problems in museums such as single display mode and fixed interaction style of collections, which makes cognitive load higher and visiting experience poorer for tourists. Mobile Augmented Reality is a technology that seamlessly integrates virtual information with real environment based on mobile devices. Museum applications based on Mobile Augmented Reality can improve the display richness and meet new visiting needs of the public in the digital era. Firstly, this article introduces the key technologies of Mobile Augmented Reality and its use in museums. Secondly, according to different application functions, classifiable explanations for Mobile Augmented Reality application examples are given. Thirdly, based on the progress in the application of Mobile Augmented Reality in museums at home and abroad, from three dimensions of content, guide, and interaction, designing thought regarding the application of Mobile Augmented Reality for museums is summarized.

The surprising informational value of "just asking"	JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article						prediction; forecast; judgment; prediction markets; self-reports; surveys		Psychologists typically measure beliefs and preferences using self-reports, whereas economists are much more likely to infer them from behavior. Prediction markets appear to be a victory for the economic approach, having yielded more accurate probability estimates than opinion polls or experts for a wide variety of events, all without ever asking for self-reported beliefs. We conduct the most direct comparison to date of prediction markets to simple self-reports using a within-subject design. Our participants traded on the likelihood of geopolitical events. Each time they placed a trade, they first had to report their belief that the event would occur on a 0-100 scale. When previously validated aggregation algorithms were applied to self-reported beliefs, they were at least as accurate as prediction-market prices in predicting a wide range of geopolitical events. Furthermore, the combination of approaches was significantly more accurate than prediction-market prices alone, indicating that self-reports contained information that the market did not efficiently aggregate. Combining measurement techniques across behavioral and social sciences may have greater benefits than previously thought.

Accordingly, the functions of instruction, socialization, and qualification that schools fulfill were assessed in accordance with the literature and teachers' opinions. Designed in a descriptive survey model, this study employed a parallel mixed design utilizing both qualitative and quantitative data collection instruments. Two questionnaire forms one for demographic information and one for teachers' opinions were used for the quantitative data and semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted for the qualitative data set. As for research findings, teachers think that schools pay more attention to the function of socialization than instruction and qualification and that this function should not be only under their responsibility, rather be completed through cooperation with families. Furthermore, findings also point out that children should be equipped with meaningful daily life information, they should be encouraged to make career plans that will make them happy based on a "self-get to know" process, and they should be prepared for the next educational level.

As with all scientific revolutions, a few experiments in a small number of laboratories have changed the way in which we think about and design experiments. As a result of these experiments, there is much evidence to suggest that a rudimentary understanding of some of the processes that cause aging will be available in the next decade. One particular area of progress is the molecular genetics of lifespan. Although one may draw some distinctions between chronological lifespan and normal aging, extended lifespan remains one of the best indicators that an intervention in an aging process has been made. The isolation of a long-lived variant of a laboratory invertebrate is now essentially a trivial project but the information obtained from this approach is proving invaluable. As with most other biological problems, the most important experimental developments are coming from studying simple organisms in a reductionist fashion.

Their low operation and maintenance costs have made them a popular choice for wastewater treatment, particularly in developing countries since there is little need for specialised skills to run the systems. This paper provides a critical review of the literature on the removal mechanisms operating in tertiary lagoons, and their overall performance. Numerous physical and chemical parameters have been suggested as factors involved in bacterial removal, and particular attention is paid in this paper to the relationship between pH,dissolved oxygen concentration and light. Very little information is available on the mechanisms of removal for intestinal parasites or viruses, or for BOD, COD or heavy metals. The two proposed mechanisms for nitrogen removal (ammonia volatilisation and sedimentation of organic nitrogen) are discussed. It has become obvious from the wide variations in performance reported in the literature that the design criteria currently in use for lagoons are not adequate.

J	Fylan, F; Fylan, B				Fylan, Fiona; Fylan, Beth			Co-creating social licence for sharing health and care data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Patient; Big data; Health records; Barriers; Co-design		Background: Optimising the use of patient data has the potential to produce a transformational change in healthcare planning, treatment, condition prevention and understanding disease progression. Establishing how people's trust could be secured and a social licence to share data could be achieved is of paramount importance. Methods: The study took place across Yorkshire and the Humber, in the North of the England, using a sequential mixed methods approach comprising focus groups, surveys and co-design groups. Twelve focus groups explored people's response to how their health and social care data is, could, and should be used. A survey examined who should be able to see health and care records, acceptable uses of anonymous health and care records, and trust in different organisations. Case study cards addressed willingness for data to be used for different purposes. Cocreation workshops produced a set of guidelines for how data should be used. Results: Focus group participants (n = 80) supported sharing health and care data for direct care and were surprised that this is not already happening. They discussed concerns about the currency and accuracy of their records and possible stigma associated with certain diagnoses, such as mental health conditions. They were less supportive of social care access to their records. They discussed three main concerns about their data being used for research or service planning: being identified; security limitations; and the potential rationing of care on the basis of information in their record such as their lifestyle choices. Survey respondents (n = 1031) agreed that their GP (98 %) and hospital doctors and nurses (93 %) should be able to see their health and care records. There was more limited support for pharmacists (37 %), care staff (36 %), social workers (24 %) and researchers (24 %). Respondents thought their health and social care records should be used to help plan services (88 %), to help people stay healthy (67 %), to help find cures for diseases (67 %), for research for the public good (58 %), but only 16 % for commercial research. Co-creation groups developed a set of principles for a social licence for data sharing based around good governance, effective processes, the type of organisation, and the ability to opt in and out. Conclusion: People support their data being shared for a range of purposes and co-designed a set of principles that would secure their trust and consent to data sharing.

J	Hallström, J; Klasander, C				Hallstrom, Jonas; Klasander, Claes			Visible parts, invisible whole: Swedish technology student teachers' conceptions about technological systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN EDUCATION			English	Article						Technological systems; Conceptions; Technology teacher education; Systems theory; Sweden	COMPLEX-SYSTEMS; THINKING	Technological systems are included as a component of national technology curricula and standards for primary and secondary education as well as corresponding teacher education around the world. Little is known, however, of how pupils, students, and teachers conceive of technological systems. In this article we report on a study investigating Swedish technology student teachers' conceptions of technological systems. The following research question is posed: How do Swedish technology student teachers conceive of technological systems? Data was collected through in-depth qualitative surveys with 26 Swedish technology student teachers. The data was analysed using a hermeneutic method, aided by a theoretical synthesis of established system theories (system significants). The main results of the study are that the technology student teachers expressed diverse conceptions of technological systems, but that on average almost half of them provided answers that were considered as undefined. The parts of the systems that the students understood were mostly the visible parts, either components, devices, or products such as buttons, power lines, hydroelectric plants, or the interface with the software inside a mobile phone. However, the 'invisible' or abstract aspects of the technological systems, such as flows of information, energy or matter, or control operations were difficult to understand for the majority of the students. The flow of information was particularly challenging in this regard. The students could identify the input and often the output of the systems, that is, what systems or components do, but the processes that take place within the systems were elusive. Comparing between technological systems also proved difficult for many students. The role of humans was considered important but it was mostly humans as users not as actors on a more systemic level, for example, as system owners, innovators, or politicians. This study confirms previous research in that the students had a basic understanding of structure, input and output of a technological system. Thus, the adult students in this study did not seem to have better understanding of technological systems than school pupils and teachers in previous studies, although this is in line with previous investigations on the general system thinking capabilities of children and adults. The most important implication of this study is that students need to be trained in systems thinking, particularly regarding how components work and connect to each other, flows (especially of information), system dependency, and the human role in technological systems.

J	Pellecchia, M; Kozikowski, AP				Pellecchia, M; Kozikowski, AP			Indolactam and benzolactam compounds as new medicinal leads with binding selectivity for C1 domains of protein kinase C isozymes	CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN			English	Review							PHORBOL ESTER BINDING; TUMOR PROMOTERS. SYNTHESIS; SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS; HYDROPHOBIC MOIETY; DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASES; DOMAIN; DELTA; GAMMA; PKC; CLARIFICATION	This issue Of Current Pharmaceutical Design is dedicated to the characterization of potential anticancer agents. In this respect, a plethora of approaches are currently being investigated to design or discover novel compounds that are capable to effectively and selectively kill cancer cells, sparing normal cells. These approaches vary from the selection of possible cancer-specific protein targets and the design and synthesis of their potential inhibitors, to the selection and chemical modification of natural products or known cytotoxic agents with anticancer activity. to computational approaches, just to mention a few. Thought not nearly close to be a comprehensive review of the possible current approaches to cancer drug discovery, the four reviews reported here represents excellent examples of as many different methodologies. The first article by Kazuhiro Irie, Yu Nakagawa and Hajime Ohigashi [1] reports on the derivation of novel Compounds based on indolactams and benzolactams targeting protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes. As described in the review, the design of agents with not only PKC isozyme selectivity but also the Cl domain selectivity of each PKC isozyme is of fundamental importance for understanding the precise mechanism of tumor promotion and developing novel therapeutic compounds. An emerging field in cancer drug discovery is the search for compounds capable to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy (chemosensitizers). Most of the activities in this area are related to the inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins that, over expressed in most human cancers, prevent cancer cells to die despite radiation or chemotherapy. The review by Maurizio Pellecchia and John Reed [2] reports on recent findings that link anticancer and chemopreventive activity of certain natural polyphenols to their direct inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. A discussion oil possible improvements Of Such compounds as well as their potential uses as chemosensitizers in combination therapy is reported. The search for novel anticancer agents often requires the synthesis of many compounds or the screen of large libraries of compounds. Both approaches are costly and time consuming. Computational chemistry may reduce these efforts by increasing the likelihood of a positive outcome from such studies. In the review by Steven Ren and Eric Lien [3] the contributions of different physicochemical parameters to the tumor cell growth inhibitory activities of several anticancer agents are evaluated by a quantitative structure-activity relationship approach (QSAR). Intriguing results are shown demonstrating that compounds' molecular weight (MW) is the most important contributor to the tumor cell growth inhibitory activities among the physicochemical parameters examined, indicating that MW should be taken into account in anticancer drug design. Also, the results obtained may be used as a filter to design smaller focused libraries from a large number of compounds to be experimentally tested. A traditional way to develop anticancer compounds capable of discriminating between cancer and normal cells is to exploit protein targets involved in cell division. The crucial role played by Tubulin in cell-division has made this protein a target for natural product-based chemical defense mechanisms. Such antimitotic compounds have also great potential as anticancer agents. Peter Wipf, Jonathan Reevs and Billy Day [4] report on elegant synthetic approaches to derive novel analogues of the antimitotic marine natural product curacin aimed at improving anticancer activity and chemical-physical properties. Low water-solubility and lack of chemical stability have prevented the use of curacin A for clinical development. Therefore the synthetic schemes and analogs proposed in the review might prove very useful in probing the efficacy of such agents in cancer therapy. Overall, the current issue addresses in remarkable detail different aspects of current approaches to cancer drug discovery. We thank all the contributors for their excellent reviews.

The diversity of natural products makes them an attractive target for interrogation by both chemists and biologists alike. Indeed, the study of 12-membered macrolactones has already led to the discovery of lead drug compounds and new biological targets, which has motivated the development of diverted total synthetic routes to libraries of analogs. This review explores the discovery, biological characterization, and synthesis of several 12-membered macrolactones, exploiting examples that underscore their importance in the drug discovery field. It is our hope that this review will motivate further interest in this class of natural products, a group of molecules that we think merit the classification of 'privileged scaffolds' within the medicinal chemistry community, to further investigate and develop novel compounds with promising bioactivity.

Sustainable development education aims to cultivate students' thinking ability to better integrate with the contemporary world view, so classroom practice should involve innovative teaching and learning. The goal of sustainable development education is to cultivate talents with high-level thinking and sustainable development abilities. The concept of deep learning emphasizes mobilizing students' internal motivation, focusing on problem-solving ability, improving students' critical thinking level, and developing students' lifelong learning ability. The concept of deep learning has evolved with the times. The introduction of the concept of deep learning in teaching can enhance students' understanding of the nature of knowledge, cultivate students' high-level thinking, and enable students to achieve better learning results. Integrating the concept of deep learning into teaching has extremely important significance and value for sustainable development education. It has become a hot topic in the world to comprehensively analyze the research status of deep learning and explore how deep learning can help education achieve sustainable development. In this study, CiteSpace (6.1.R2) visualization analysis software was used to visualize and quantitatively analyze the literature on deep learning in the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI). The visualized analysis is conducted on the annual publication amount, authors, institutions, countries, keywords, and high-frequency cited words of deep learning, to obtain the basic information, development status, hot spots, and evolution trends of deep learning research. The results show that the annual publication volume of deep learning is on the rise; deep learning research has entered a rapid growth stage since 2007; the United States has published the most papers and is the center of the global deep learning research collaboration network; the countries involved in the study were often interconnected, but the institutions and authors were relatively dispersed; research in the field of deep learning mainly focuses on concept exploration, influencing factors, implementation strategies and effectiveness of deep learning; learning method, learning strategy, curriculum design, interactive learning environment are the high-frequency keywords of deep learning research. It can be seen that deep learning research has the characteristics of transnationality, multidisciplinary nature and multi-perspective. In addition, this paper systematically analyzes the latest progress in global deep learning research and objectively predicts that using intelligent technology to design appropriate teaching and learning scenarios and evaluation methods may become the future development trend of deep learning. The research results of this paper will help readers to have a comprehensive understanding of deep learning research, provide deeper and more targeted resources for integrating deep learning concepts into teaching, and promote better sustainable development of education.

Most paradigms have presented the alternative outcome either after or simultaneous with the chosen outcome, which complicates the observation on the brain activity associated with the alternative outcome. To circumvent this perceived shortcoming, we modified the classic paradigm designed by Yeung and Sanfey (2004) such that the alternative outcome was presented before the chosen outcome in each trial while an electroencephalogram was recorded. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) elicited by the positive alternative outcome was larger than that elicited by the negative alternative outcome, suggesting that the participants evaluated the positive alternative outcome as negative feedback. Moreover, the FRN and the P3 elicited by the chosen outcome were influenced by the valence of the alternative outcome. The current study reveals that the alternative outcome is treated as important information even though it is economically neutral.

J	Ye, J; Dang, YG				Ye, Jing; Dang, Yaoguo			A novel grey fixed weight cluster model based on interval grey numbers	GREY SYSTEMS-THEORY AND APPLICATION			English	Article						Grey clustering evaluation; Interval grey number; Integral mean value function; Triangular whitenization weight function	ROUGH SETS; OPTIMIZATION; CHINA	Purpose - Nowadays, evaluation objects are becoming more and more complicated. The interval grey numbers can be used to more accurately express the evaluation objects. However, the information distribution of interval grey numbers is not balanced. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the central-point triangular whitenization weight function to solve the clustering process of this kind of numbers. Design/methodology/approach - A new expression of the central-point triangular whitenization weight function is presented in this paper, in terms of the grey cluster problem based on interval grey numbers. By establishing the integral mean value function on the set of interval grey numbers, the application range of grey clustering model is extended to the interval grey number category, and, in this way, the grey fixed weight cluster model based on interval grey numbers is obtained. Findings - The model is verified by a case which reveals a high distinguishability, validity and practicability. Practical implications - This model can be used in many fields, such as agriculture, economy, geology and medical science, and provides a feasible method for evaluation schemes in performance evaluation, scheme selection, risk evaluation and so on. Originality/value - The central-point triangular whitenization weight function is introduced.

In this paper we examine the tariff preferences of 1,500 households in Kathmandu, Nepal. We first use a bivariate probit model to examine stated preferences for (1) an increasing block tariff (IBT) and (2) a positive fixed charge. We find that household preferences for IBTs and fixed charges are not easily explained by household socioeconomic and water use characteristics. Second, we ask respondents what they think a fair water bill would be for a randomly assigned quantity of water. We model the responses as a function of both quantity and household socioeconomic and water use characteristics. While households support a water tariff that results in a household's water bill increasing as a household's water use increases, we do not find evidence that households support an increasing, nonlinear relationship between water use and a household's water bill. Our results suggest that respondents desire affordable piped water services and water bills that are calculated fairly for everyone. Because the notion of fairness in Kathmandu varies, utility managers may have considerable latitude in choosing a tariff structure that focuses on other objectives, such as cost recovery, revenue stability, and economic efficiency.

Four semesters of classroom tests with WILSIM-GC	BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							GENDER-DIFFERENCES; SIMULATIONS; ATTITUDES; CONCEPTIONS; STRATEGIES; BEHAVIOR	This paper presents results from a randomized experimental design replicated over four semesters that compared students' performance in understanding landform evolution processes as measured by the pretest to posttest score growth between two treatment methods: an online interactive simulation tool and a paper-based exercise. While both methods were shown to be effective at enhancing students' learning of the landform concepts and processes, there was no statistically significant difference in score growth between the two instructional methods. However, the attitudinal survey indicated that students consistently favored the simulation approach over the paper-based exercise. With the simulation method, female students showed greater score growth than males, especially for test items requiring higher level thinking. This indicates that the visually rich interactive simulation tool may be integrated to better support female students' learning in geoscience. Science major students generally outperformed non-science major students in terms of score growth, which suggests that background knowledge played an important role in realizing the potential of computer modeling in enhancing students' learning. Sufficient scaffolding is necessary to maximize the effect of interactive earth surface modeling in geoscience education.

Knowing in advance when and where a forthcoming event (e.g., ball interception) will take place is thought to be a necessary condition for planning the appropriate action and adapting one's movements. Conversely prospective control mechanisms allow actors to produce on-line regulations based on the Perception of their current relationship to the environment. This review is designed to provide evidence obtained from various sports in support of the use of prospective control mechanisms. These mechanisms are functional, in the sense that they allow the actor to adapt to unexpected changes.. They are also parsimonious, in that they enable the actor to accommodate future events without having to make calculations or inferences. The influence of learning on the implementation and attunement of these mechanisms is discussed, and some concluding remarks for sport psychologists are made.

Using a camera placed at a fixed position, particle motions can be visualized by rendering trajectories or by animations. Applying such direct techniques to large, time dependent particle data sets often results in cluttered images in which the dynamic properties of the underlying system are difficult to interpret. In this case study we take an alternative approach to the visualization of ion motions. Instead of rendering ion position data directly, we first extract meaningful motion information from the ion position data and then map this information onto geometric primitives. Our goal is to produce high-level visualizations that reflect the physicists' way of thinking about ion dynamics. Parameterized geometric icons are defined to encode motion information of clusters of related ions. In addition, a parameterized camera control mechanism is used to analyze relative instead of only absolute ion motions. We apply the techniques to simulations of Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) experiments. The data produced by such simulations can amount to 5(.)10(4) ions and 10(5) tmesteps. This paper discusses the requirements, design and informal evaluation of the implemented system.

Object and spatial mnemonic interference differentially engage lateral and medial entorhinal cortex in humans	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article							COMPLEMENTARY LEARNING-SYSTEMS; PATTERN SEPARATION; DENTATE GYRUS; TEMPORAL-LOBE; POSTRHINAL CORTEX; PERIRHINAL CORTEX; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL CORTICES; RECOGNITION MEMORY; HIPPOCAMPAL; CONTEXT	Recent models of episodic memory propose a division of labor among medial temporal lobe cortices comprising the parahippocampal gyrus. Specifically, perirhinal and lateral entorhinal cortices are thought to comprise an object/item information pathway, whereas parahippocampal and medial entorhinal cortices are thought to comprise a spatial/contextual information pathway. Although several studies in human subjects have demonstrated a perirhinal/parahippocampal division, such a division among subregions of the human entorhinal cortex has been elusive. Other recent work has implicated pattern separation computations in the dentate gyrus and CA3 subregions of the hippocampus as a mechanism supporting the resolution of mnemonic interference. However, the nature of contributions of medial temporal lobe cortices to downstream hippocampal computations is largely unknown. We used high-resolution fMRI during a task selectively taxing mnemonic discrimination of object identity or spatial location, designed to differentially engage the two information pathways in the medial temporal lobes. Consistent with animal models, we demonstrate novel evidence for a domain-selective dissociation between lateral and medial entorhinal cortex in humans, and between perirhinal and parahippocampal cortex as a function of information content. Conversely, hippocampal dentate gyrus/CA3 demonstrated signals consistent with resolution of mnemonic interference across domains. These results provide insight into the information processing capacities and hierarchical interference resolution throughout the human medial temporal lobe.

The architecture is designed to support computational tools for engineering and science research In Virtual Information Grid Organizations (as opposed to in vivo or in vitro experimental research). A novel aspect of In-VIGO is the extensive use of virtualization technology, emerging standards for grid-computing and other Internet middleware. In the context of In-VIGO, virtualization denotes the ability of resources to support multiplexing, manifolding and polymorphism (i.e. to simultaneously appear as multiple resources with possibly different functionalities). Virtualization technologies are available or emerging for all the resources needed to construct virtual grids which would ideally inherit the above mentioned properties. In particular, these technologies enable the creation of dynamic pools of virtual resources that can be aggregated on-demand for application-specific user-specific grid-computing. This change in paradigm from building grids out of physical resources to constructing virtual grids has many advantages but also requires new thinking on how to architect, manage and optimize the necessary middleware. This paper reviews the motivation for In-VIGO approach, discusses the technologies used, describes an early architecture for In-VIGO that represents a first step towards the end goal of building virtual information grids, and reports on first experiences with the In-VIGO software under development.

J	Hew, PC				Hew, Patrick Chisan			Preserving a combat commander's moral agency: The Vincennes Incident as a Chinese Room	ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Moral agency; Chinese Room; Command and control; Vincennes Incident		We argue that a command and control system can undermine a commander's moral agency if it causes him/her to process information in a purely syntactic manner, or if it precludes him/her from ascertaining the truth of that information. Our case is based on the resemblance between a commander's circumstances and the protagonist in Searle's Chinese Room, together with a careful reading of Aristotle's notions of 'compulsory' and 'ignorance'. We further substantiate our case by considering the Vincennes Incident, when the crew of a warship mistakenly shot down a civilian airliner. To support a combat commander's moral agency, designers should strive for systems that help commanders and command teams to think and manipulate information at the level of meaning. 'Down conversions' of information from meaning to symbols must be adequately recovered by 'up conversions', and commanders must be able to check that their sensors are working and are being used correctly. Meanwhile ethicists should establish a mechanism that tracks the potential moral implications of choices in a system's design and intended operation. Finally we highlight a gap in normative ethics, in that we have ways to deny moral agency, but not to affirm it.

Dishevelled (Dvl) transduces Writ signals from the receptor Frizzled (Fz) to downstream components in canonical and noncanonical Writ signaling pathways. The Dvl PDZ domain is thought to play an essential role in both pathways, and we recently demonstrated that the Dvl PDZ domain binds directly to Fz receptors. In this study, using structure-based virtual ligand screening, we identified an organic molecule (NSC668036) from the National Cancer Institute small-molecule library that can bind to the Dvl PDZ domain. We then used molecular dynamics simulation to analyze the binding between the PDZ domain and NSC668036 in detail. In addition, we showed that, in Xenopus, as expected, NSC668036 inhibited the signaling induced by Wnt3A. This compound provides a basis for rational design of high-affinity inhibitors of the PDZ domain, which can block Writ signaling by interrupting the Fz-Dvl interaction.

J	Russell, S; Milne, MJ; Dey, C				Russell, Shona; Milne, Markus J.; Dey, Colin			Accounts of nature and the nature of accounts Critical reflections on environmental accounting and propositions for ecologically informed accounting	ACCOUNTING AUDITING & ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL			English	Article						Pluralism; Sustainability; Nature; Environmental accounting; "Orders of worth" and pragmatic sociology; Ecological accounts	NEOLIBERALISING NATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIODIVERSITY; SUSTAINABILITY; ACCOUNTABILITY; EXPLORATION; ORGANIZATIONS; MANAGEMENT; PRAGMATISM; SOCIOLOGY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review and synthesise academic research in environmental accounting and demonstrate its shortcomings. It provokes scholars to rethink their conceptions of "accounts" and "nature", and alongside others in this AAAJ special issue, provides the basis for an agenda for theoretical and empirical research that begins to "ecologise" accounting. Design/methodology/approach - Utilising a wide range of thought from accounting, geography, sociology, political ecology, nature writing and social activism, the paper provides an analysis and critique of key themes associated with 40 years research in environmental accounting. It then considers how that broad base of work in social science, particularly pragmatic sociology (e.g. Latour, Boltanksi and Thevenot), could contribute to reimagining an ecologically informed accounting. Findings - Environmental accounting research overwhelmingly focuses on economic entities and their inputs and outputs. Conceptually, an "information throughput" model dominates. There is little or no environment in environmental accounting, and certainly no ecology. The papers in this AAAJ special issue contribute to these themes, and alongside social science literature, indicate significant opportunities for research to begin to overcome them. Research limitations/implications - This paper outlines and encourages the advancement of ecological accounts and accountabilities drawing on conceptual resources across social sciences, arts and humanities. It identifies areas for research to develop its interdisciplinary potential to contribute to ecological sustainability and social justice. Originality/value - How to "ecologise" accounting and conceptualise human and non-human entities has received little attention in accounting research. This paper and AAAJ special issue provides empirical, practical and theoretical material to advance further work.

J	Zhang, QH; Lai, HJ				Zhang, Qiaohe; Lai, Huijuan			Strategies of Applying Visual Element Combination to Improve Visual Cognitive Efficiency in the Era of Big Data Network	MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							DESIGN	Fundamentally, visual cognition refers to a way of thinking in which the objective information of the external world is transmitted to the brain through the visual nerve and then processed by the brain. In the evolutionary history of human beings, the pressure brought by the environment has led to the rapid development of the visual system and visual cognition. As with language ability and logical ability, the understanding of visual cognition is the key to the analysis of human intelligence. Therefore, research on improving the efficiency of visual cognition is urgently needed. The purpose of this paper is to find methods and strategies to improve the efficiency of visual cognition based on the application of visual element combination. This article first gives a general introduction to visual elements and design methods. Then, the eye movement behavior and visual saliency calculation model are established. Using Gaussian analysis and channel saliency test method based on "where" and "what" principles, the cognitive effect of pictures in visual elements is specifically analyzed. Then, the questionnaire survey method was used to conduct experiments on the problem that visual elements affect the efficiency of visual cognition, and finally the results were obtained. At the macro level, dynamic pictures with color and auxiliary text can effectively improve the cognitive efficiency of vision. It enables people to grasp cognitive objects quickly and form stronger cognitive ability. However, at the micro level, due to the intuitiveness and meaning of words, the visual cognitive efficiency of the recognition effect is high. In terms of image scale, the two scale parameters [4 x 4] and [6 x 6] perform better. The human eye is relatively optimal at 4/90 similar to 6/90 on the attention scale of the image. At the same time, under the [4 x 4] scale parameter, even if the image loses some features, it can save about 95% of the cognitive time overhead.

J	Hargreaves, T				Hargreaves, Tom			Beyond energy feedback	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Editorial Material						energy feedback; feedback; feedforward; policy feedback; smart meters; social practices; speculative design; user engagement	CONSUMPTION; POLICY; HOME	The aims of this commentary are to generate thought and discussion about the potential role and value of energy feedback in future energy transitions. There is now a global research and policy effort devoted to developing energy feedback (e.g. from improved bills, metering or displays) in order to change energy-use behaviour and reduce demand. Within this, calls to go beyond conventional energy feedback through the use of disaggregation are increasingly common. An alternative approach is presented for how to go beyond energy feedback. Instead of focusing solely on generating larger energy savings, it is argued that new approaches need to consider how conventional energy feedback frames energy problems and shapes the agency and engagement of different actors. Three potential routes are highlighted for going beyond conventional approaches to energy feedback through emerging work on practice feedback, policy feedback and speculative design. Three core challenges for future work on energy feedback are: recognizing the multiple forms of energy-related feedback that shape everyday life; engaging with a much wider range of actors involved in shaping energy feedback loops; and using new approaches to energy-related feedback to reframe energy problems and establish new roles for actors engaged in energy transitions.

However, the future IoT architecture is still under evolution profiting from the overwhelming development of cyberspace and cyber technologies. Based on the traditional physical-based IoT, social-inspired Internet of People (IoP) and brain-abstracted Internet of Thinking (IoTk), an intelligent embryo of cyber-enabled Internet of X (IoX) is being established where all things, entities, people and thinking are interacted seamlessly. In this article, we clearly introduce the cyber-enabled IoX from perspective of both ubiquitous connections and space convergence, and design an architecture with four pillars, namely, things, people, thinking and cyberentities in respective spaces. In addition, we analyze the fundamental issues in IoX development, such as information exploding, link exploding and application exploding from the view of ubiquitous connections, entity exploding and relationship exploding on the basis of space convergence, and service exploding from overall aspects, where potential solutions are discussed at the same time. The intelligent cyber-enabled IoX will be the cornerstone for future techniques and applications, and proves to be the solid foundation for upcoming intelligent and proactive era.

The framework is currently applied in case study research to find alignment patterns used in practice. First results presented in this paper indicate that the framework might yield an operationalization of strategic architecture alignment models. We also present an alignment pattern which shows a difference between how architectures are designed at the application level and the infrastructure level. We think this difference is significant for practical alignment models.

The complexity of structural environment and management makes its operation and maintenance difficult. To solve this problem, a distributed mixed reality (MR) and internet of things (IoT) system is developed through game thinking. Firstly, digital models are created based on design drawings and real-world environments, and then an MR system for the UPN is built by the game engine and the OpenXR platform. Secondly, an IoT cloud platform is built to connect with the MR system based on the API sets and cloud services; the data communication between sensors and MR devices is linked with the Socket method, and the data filtering model is constructed by the Kalman algorithm to realize the information exchange between the field workers and the backend managers. Finally, the National Center for Materials Service Safety at the University of Science and Technology Beijing (NCMS_USTB) is used as the experimental site to test this system, and its underground sewage and rainwater pipeline network are used to simulate the key problems in the operation and maintenance. The effect of the application shows that there is potential technical complementarity between the MR and IoT, and the distributed MR-IoT approach can be used as a new technical reference for the operation and maintenance of the UPN.

J	De Santis, E; Rizzi, A				De Santis, Enrico; Rizzi, Antonello			Prototype Theory Meets Word Embedding: A Novel Approach for Text Categorization via Granular Computing	COGNITIVE COMPUTATION			English	Article						Conceptual spaces; Granular computing; Text classification; Word Embedding; Conceptual embedding; Long Short Term Memory	INFORMATION; REPRESENTATIONS; DESIGN; ISSUES; BAG	The problem of the information representation and interpretation coming from senses by the brain has plagued scientists for decades. The same problems, from a different perspective, hold in automated Pattern Recognition systems. Specifically, in solving various NLP tasks, an ever better and richer semantic representation of text as a set of features is needed and a plethora of text embedding techniques in algebraic spaces are continuously provided by researchers. These spaces are well suited to be conceived as conceptual spaces in light of the Gardenfors's Conceptual Space theory, which, within the Cognitive Science paradigm, seeks a geometrization of thought that bridges the gap between an associative lower level and a symbolic higher level in which information is organized and processed and where inductive reasoning is appropriate. Granular Computing can offer the toolbox for granulating text that can be represented by more abstract entities than words, offering a good hierarchical representation of the text embedded in an algebraic space driving Machine Learning applications, specifically, in text mining tasks. In this paper, the Conceptual Space Theory, the Granular Computing approach and Machine Learning are bound in a novel common framework for solving some text categorization tasks with both standard classifiers suited for working with Fin vectors and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) - an LSTM - able to deal with sequences. Instead of working with word vectors, the algorithms process more abstract entities (concepts), where patterns, in a first approach, are obtained through the construction of a symbolic histogram starting from a suitable set of information granules, representing a document as a distribution of concepts. For the RNN case, as a further novelty, a text is represented as a random walk over prototypes within the conceptual space synthesized over a suitable text embedding procedure. A comparison of the performance and a critical discussion are offered for both a neural embedding technique and the well-known LSA, showing how the conceptual level leads also to Knowledge Discovery applications.

J	Peiris-John, R; Dizon, L; Sutcliffe, K; Kang, K; Fleming, T				Peiris-John, Roshini; Dizon, Lovely; Sutcliffe, Kylie; Kang, Kristy; Fleming, Theresa			Co-creating a large-scale adolescent health survey integrated with access to digital health interventions	DIGITAL HEALTH			English	Article						Adolescent; digital health interventions; delivery of health care; health promotion; primary prevention; co-design	DEPRESSION; MANAGEMENT; SYMPTOMS; STUDENTS	Aim: This paper describes how we engaged with adolescents and health providers to integrate access to digital health interventions as part of a large-scale secondary school health and wellbeing survey in New Zealand. Methods: We conducted nine participatory, iterative co-design sessions involving 29 adolescents, and two workshops with young people (n = 11), digital and health service providers (n = 11) and researchers (n = 9) to gain insights into end-user perspectives on the concept and how best to integrate digital interventions in to the survey. Results: Students' perceived integrating access to digital health interventions into a large-scale youth health survey as acceptable and highly beneficial. They did not want personalized/normative feedback, but thought that every student should be offered all the help options. Participants identified key principles: assurance of confidentiality, usability, participant choice and control, and language. They highlighted wording as important for ease and comfort, and emphasised the importance of user control. Participants expressed that it would be useful and acceptable for survey respondents to receive information about digital help options addressing a range of health and wellbeing topics. Conclusion: The methodology of adolescent-practitioner-researcher collaboration and partnership was central to this research and provided useful insights for the development and delivery of adolescent health surveys integrated with digital help options. The results from the ongoing study will provide useful data on the impact of digital health interventions integrated in large-scale surveys, as a novel methodology. Future research on engaging with adolescents once interventions are delivered will be useful to explore benefits over time.

However, there is evidence indicating that gene transfer can also occur from microbes to higher species, such as plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. This horizontal transfer can be carried out by small RNAs (sRNAs). sRNAs have been recently reported to move across kingdoms as mobile signals, spreading silencing information toward targeted genes. sRNAs, especially microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), are non-coding molecules that control gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. Some sRNAs act in a cross kingdom manner between animals and their parasites, but little is known about such sRNAs associated with plants. In this report, we provide a brief introduction to miRNAs that are transferred from plants to mammals/viruses and siRNAs that are transferred from microbes to plants. Both miRNAs and siRNAs can exert corresponding functions in the target organisms. Additionally, we provide information concerning a host-induced gene silencing system as a potential application that utilizes the transgenic trafficking of RNA molecules to silence the genes of interacting organisms. Moreover, we lay out the controversial views regarding cross kingdom miRNAs and call for better methodology and experimental design to confirm this unique function of miRNAs.

Fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization probes targeting members of the phylum <i>Candidatus</i> Saccharibacteria falsely target Eikelboom type 1851 filaments and other <i>Chloroflexi</i> members	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS			English	Article							16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; GREEN NONSULFUR BACTERIA; OLIGONUCLEOTIDE PROBE; DIVISION TM7; SLUDGE; IDENTIFICATION; ECOPHYSIOLOGY; ACCESSIBILITY; PHYSIOLOGY; PHYLOGENY	The FISH probe TM7-305 is thought to target the filamentous Eikelboom morphotype 0041 as a member of the Candidatus Saccharibacteria' (formerly TM7) phylum. However, with activated sludge samples in both Japan and Australia, this probe hybridized consistently with filamentous bacteria fitting the description of the morphotype 1851, which also responded positively to the CHL1851 FISH probe designed to target Chloroflexi members of this morphotype. 16S rRNA clone libraries from samples containing type 1851 TM7-305-positive filaments yielded Chloroflexi clones with high sequence similarity to Kouleothrix aurantiaca. These contained a variant TM7-305 probe target site possessing weakly destabilizing mismatches insufficient to prevent probe hybridization. Furthermore, the TM7-905 FISH probe, designed to target members of the entire Candidatus Saccharibacteria' phylum, also hybridized with the filament morphotypes 0041/0675, which responded also to the phylum level Chloroflexi probes. Many Chloroflexi sequences have only a single base mismatch to the TM7-905 probe target sequence. When competitor probes for both the TM7-305 and TM7-905 Chloroflexi non-target sites were applied, no fluorescent signal was seen in any of the filamentous organisms also hybridizing with the aforementioned Chloroflexi probes. These data indicate that these competitor probes must be included in hybridizations when both the TM7-905 and TM7-305 FISH probes are applied, to minimize potential false positive FISH results.

This study used a convenience sampling technique to examine factors associated with misinformation about COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa using an online cross-sectional survey. A link to the online self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 1,969 participants through social media platforms and the authors' email networks. Four false statements-informed by results from a pilot study-were included in the survey. The participants' responses were classified as "Agree," "Neutral," and "Disagree." A multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors. Among those who responded to the survey, 19.3% believed that COVID-19 was designed to reduce world population, 22.2% thought the ability to hold your breath for 10 seconds meant that you do not have COVID-19, 27.8% believed drinking hot water flushes down the virus, and 13.9% thought that COVID-19 had little effect on Blacks compared with Whites. An average of 33.7% were unsure whether the 4 false statements were true. Multivariate analysis revealed that those who thought COVID-19 was unlikely to continue in their countries reported higher odds of believing in these 4 false statements. Other significant factors associated with belief in misinformation were age (older adults), employment status (unemployed), gender (female), education (bachelor's degree), and knowledge about the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Strategies to reduce the spread of false information about COVID-19 and other future pandemics should target these subpopulations, especially those with limited education. This will also enhance compliance with public health measures to reduce spread of further outbreaks.

J	Zhao, DN				Zhao, Danni			Systematic Mode Construction of Mixed Teaching from the Perspective of Deep Learning	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							DEPTH	Deep learning will be one of the key technologies to promote learning in the next five years. With the rapid advancement of the information era, significant changes in students' learning and thinking patterns have occurred. How to further encourage the development of students' professional skills and innovative capacity has become the focus of society under the influence of the notion of deep learning. With the application of information technology in education, blended learning, as the only key trend mentioned in the new media alliance report for five consecutive years, has injected fresh vitality into the reform of traditional classrooms and laid a foundation for better promoting in-depth learning. Therefore, how to effectively use blended learning to change these phenomena has become an urgent problem to be solved. The goal of this research is to encourage pupils to learn in depth. This study specifies the design idea of a hybrid teaching mode supported by an information environment based on the promotion of high-order thinking capacity. Firstly, this study uses the literature research method to sort out the relevant literature on deep learning and hybrid teaching, which provides a theoretical basis for the later construction. Second, a questionnaire is utilized to assess the existing state of in-depth learning as well as the need for blended teaching. The mixed teaching mode has effectively promoted the development of students' high-level thinking abilities such as autonomous learning, problem-solving, and application innovation; played a positive role in cultivating students' in-depth learning; and finally won the unanimous recognition of students.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the usability of a cancer registry system using Cognitive Walkthrough (CW) and to assess users' agreement with its usability problems.MethodsCW was used to evaluate the registry system. We developed a checklist to help evaluators speed up the evaluation process, a problems form to collect the usability issues identified by the evaluators, and a problems severity form to determine the severity of problems by the evaluators. The problems were classified into two categories according to the CW questions and the system tasks. The agreement of the users with the system problems was examined by an online questionnaire. Users' agreement with the problems was then analyzed using the Interclass Correlation Coefficient in the SPSS 22 (Statistical Package for Social Science).ResultsIn this study, 114 problems were identified. In the categorization of problems based on the CW questions, 41% (n = 47) of the problems concerned the issue of "users do not know what to do at each stage of working with the system", 24% (n = 27) were classified as "users cannot link what they intend to do with system controls", and 22% (n = 25) were related to "user's lack of understanding of the system processes". Based on user tasks, about 36% (n = 41) of the problems were related to "removing patient duplication" and 33% (n = 38) were related to "registration of patient identification information". User agreement with the problems was high (CI 95% = 0.9 (0.96, 0.98)).ConclusionSystem problems often originate from user ignorance about what to do at each stage of using the system. Also, half of the system problems concern a mismatch between what users want to do and the system controls, or a lack of understanding about what the system does at different stages. Therefore, to avoid user confusion, designers should use clues and guides on the screen for users, design controls consistent with the user model of thinking, and provide appropriate feedback after each user action to help users understand what the system is doing. The high agreement of users with the problems showed that in the absence of users system designers can use CW to identify the problems that users face in the real environment.

Traditional content delivery mechanisms leverage only local information to make routing decisions, which results in both high latency and low delivery rate. Software-defined networking (SDN) is a novel network paradigm, the design philosophy of which could be applied to MSN for improving the content delivery performance. In this article, the centralized control thought of SDN is introduced into MSN to efficiently process social information. The classical routing algorithm of BubbleRap is improved from the perspective of network density, which is the basis of designing the sparse and dense routing mechanisms for MSNs. In addition, flexibly switching between these two routing mechanisms is implemented by a discriminating scheme, achieving efficient yet adaptive routing. The experimental results show that the delivery ratio of sparse routing is up to 83%, and the dense routing could reach up to 93%.

However, climate-based education efforts in the Midwestern United States may need a slightly different approach since this region lacks obvious indicators, such as sea level rise and melting glaciers. Interpretation, an informal communication process designed to transmit scientific information to visitors in leisure-based settings, could be a useful strategy for engaging visitors in climate change discussions. Few studies have assessed perceptions of interpreters on this topic, much less, their willingness to communicate such information. To address this issue, a mixed methods approach (surveys, interviews, photovoice) was used to examine interpreters' perceptions of climate change and its impacts in Missouri State Park and Historic Sites. Although nearly 70% of interpreters were either alarmed or concerned about climate change, many of them were unsure about its causation. Interpreters report observing impacts such as flooding, earlier plant blooming, high temperatures, extreme weather, and invasive species, but were uncertain about attributing these impacts to climate change. Interpreters did not believe that visitors would be responsive to climate-based education per se but thought the topic could be addressed in pre-existing programs and activities. Rather than discussing complex science with visitors, interpreters felt more comfortable with conveying the significance of resources at their sites. Implications from this study include acknowledging multiple viewpoints, framing strategic messages, and developing place-based educational materials.

However, in the case of frequently browsed news web pages, mass news information derived from visual design elements or different layout designs may affect the preferences of users from different demographics and socio-economic backgrounds. This is due to the dissimilarities between their physical and psychological limitations. The purpose of this study is to investigate users' white-space ratio preferences for news web pages. We tested the top ten online Chinese and English websites, 20 news web pages in total. Two statements were picked from the system usability scale (SUS) and the visual aesthetics of website inventory (VisAWI) to evaluate these samples. We took these two statements as questionnaire questions. They are the following: Q1 "I think that I would like to use this system frequently'' and Q2 "Everything goes together on these web pages.'' The design of the questionnairewas based on a five-point Likert scale. The research variables include age, gender, education, occupation, white-space ratio, along with the other demographic properties. Our results indicated that there are significant differences between age, white-space ratio, education, occupation, news sources, computer usage time, and computer usage history. The group aged between 31-45 years old scored all samples higher than other groups. None prefer too high (90%) or too low (50%) white-space ratio. It is necessary to accumulate more preferences from different groups prior to the coming age of AI and machine learning.

Sampling programs and methods of developing sampling programs for integrated pest management are not sufficient for site-specific weed management because more and different information is needed to make treatment maps than simply estimate average pest density. Sampling plans for site-specific weed management must provide information to map the weeds in the field but should be developed for the objective of prescribing spatially variable management. Weed scientists will be most successful at designing plans for site-specific weed management if they focus on this objective throughout the process of designing a sampling plan. They must also learn more about the spatial distribution and dynamics of weed populations and use that knowledge to identify cost-effective plans, recommend methods to make maps as well as collect data, and find ways to evaluate maps that reflect management to be prescribed from the map. Foremost, sampling must be thought of as an ongoing process over time that uses many types of information rather than a single event of collecting one type of information. Specifically, scientists will need to identify common characteristics rather than just differences of the spatial distribution of weeds among fields and species, recognize that map accuracy may be a poor indicator of the value of a sampling plan, and develop methods to use growers' knowledge of the distribution of weeds and past spatially variable management within a field for both making a map and recommending a sampling plan. The value of proposed methods for sampling and mapping must also be demonstrated or adoption of site-specific weed management might be limited to growers who enjoy using sophisticated technology.

Specifically, the influence of these information sources on expected and perceived flavor intensities, mismatched perceptions, perceived deception, and intention to purchase was studied by taking into account the possible moderating role of consumers' thinking style. Three studies were performed, the first and third at a Dutch University by means of surveys and sensory tests, and the second via an online survey. The results showed that, overall, most consumers did not perceive the incongruity between pictorial and textual information as mismatching. However, a perceived mismatch from packaging, whether originated by the design manipulations or not, did increase perceived deception and lowered willingness to purchase. This effect was robust for both mismatches, among packaging elements (pre-consumption) and from expected and perceived flavor ratios (post-consumption), but was more substantial for the post-consumption mismatch. Although the moderating effect of cognitive processing style regarding expected and perceived flavor ratios from pictorial and textual (ingredient list) information was not confirmed, the results indicated that the effect of salient textual information is substantial, independent of a particular processing style or label usage.

Across disciplines, this data processing task has become a significant challenge, delaying progress and actionable insights. In ecology, the growing use of camera traps (i.e., remotely triggered cameras) to collect information on wildlife has led to an enormous volume of raw data (i.e., images) in need of review and annotation. To expedite camera trap image processing, many have turned to the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and use machine learning models to automate tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in images. To contribute understanding of the utility of AI tools for processing wildlife camera trap images, we evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art computer vision model developed by Microsoft AI for Earth named MegaDetector using data from an ongoing camera trap study in Arctic Alaska, USA. Compared to image labels determined by manual human review, we found MegaDetector reliably determined the presence or absence of wildlife in images generated by motion detection camera settings (>= 94.6% accuracy), however, performance was substantially poorer for images collected with time-lapse camera settings (<= 61.6% accuracy). By examining time-lapse images where MegaDetector failed to detect wildlife, we gained practical insights into animal size and distance detection limits and discuss how those may impact the performance of MegaDetector in other systems. We anticipate our findings will stimulate critical thinking about the tradeoffs of using automated AI tools or manual human review to process camera trap images and help to inform effective implementation of study designs.

Blackawton bees	BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Bombus terrestris; buff-tailed bumble-bee; visual perception; colour vision; behaviour		Background: Real science has the potential to not only amaze, but also transform the way one thinks of the world and oneself. This is because the process of science is little different from the deeply resonant, natural processes of play. Play enables humans (and other mammals) to discover (and create) relationships and patterns. When one adds rules to play, a game is created. This is science: the process of playing with rules that enables one to reveal previously unseen patterns of relationships that extend our collective understanding of nature and human nature. When thought of in this way, science education becomes a more enlightened and intuitive process of asking questions and devising games to address those questions. But, because the outcome of all game-playing is unpredictable, supporting this 'messyness', which is the engine of science, is critical to good science education (and indeed creative education generally). Indeed, we have learned that doing 'real' science in public spaces can stimulate tremendous interest in children and adults in understanding the processes by which we make sense of the world. The present study (on the vision of bumblebees) goes even further, since it was not only performed outside my laboratory (in a Norman church in the southwest of England), but the 'games' were themselves devised in collaboration with 25 8- to 10-year-old children. They asked the questions, hypothesized the answers, designed the games (in other words, the experiments) to test these hypotheses and analysed the data. They also drew the figures (in coloured pencil) and wrote the paper. Their headteacher (Dave Strudwick) and I devised the educational programme (we call 'i,scientist'), and I trained the bees and transcribed the childrens' words into text (which was done with smaller groups of children at the school's local village pub). So what follows is a novel study (scientifically and conceptually) in 'kids speak' without references to past literature, which is a challenge. Although the historical context of any study is of course important, including references in this instance would be disingenuous for two reasons. First, given the way scientific data are naturally reported, the relevant information is simply inaccessible to the literate ability of 8- to 10-year-old children, and second, the true motivation for any scientific study (at least one of integrity) is one's own curiousity, which for the children was not inspired by the scientific literature, but their own observations of the world. This lack of historical, scientific context does not diminish the resulting data, scientific methodology or merit of the discovery for the scientific and 'non-scientific' audience. On the contrary, it reveals science in its truest (most naive) form, and in this way makes explicit the commonality between science, art and indeed all creative activities. Principal finding: 'We discovered that bumblebees can use a combination of colour and spatial relationships in deciding which colour of flower to forage from. We also discovered that science is cool and fun because you get to do stuff that no one has ever done before. (Children from Blackawton)'.	[Lotto, R.

The aim of the present study was to examine how people with schizophrenia maintain and update contextual information over an extended temporal window by using multiple primes that were either remotely associated or unrelated to the target. Fourteen participants with schizophrenia and 12 healthy matched controls were compared across two stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) (short and long) and two relatedness proportions (RP) (high and low) in a crossed design. Analysis of variance statistics revealed significant two- and three-way interactions between Group and SOA, Group and Condition, SOA and RP, and Group, SOA and RP. The participants with schizophrenia showed evidence of enhanced remote priming at the short SOA and low RP, combined with a reduction in the time course over which context could be maintained. There was some sensitivity to biasing contextual information at the short SOA, although the mechanism over which context served to update information appeared to be different from that in the controls. The participants with schizophrenia showed marked performance decrements at the long SOA (both low and high RP). Indices of remote priming at the short (but not the long) SOA correlated with both clinical ratings of thought disorder and with increasing length of illness.

J	Chen, MY; Yuan, ZC				Chen, Meiyi; Yuan, Zaicheng			Teaching Mode of English Language and Literature Based on Artificial Intelligence Technology in the Context of Big Data	MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								Widespread problems exist in English major education, which directly or indirectly restrict the development of English major education. The teaching mode of English language and literature is considered in the context of big data. This paper designs an online English learning system platform based on the BP neural network algorithm under the big data network and uses the BP neural network for learning to improve the learning level of the platform. This article adds a course of Chinese and Western cultural comparison in the process of education and teaching. Through Chinese literature and culture courses, it is conducive to learning and inheriting Chinese civilization, training students' ability to understand and communicate Chinese and Western civilizations, and also training students' thinking skills. The teaching plan introduces courses with Chinese elements such as the history of Chinese philosophy and the introduction of Chinese literary classics. Through the courses of Chinese literature and culture, students are guided to ask questions, apply theory to practice, conduct experiments, obtain data, and then analyze problems and draw conclusions according to certain research methods, which exercises students' thinking ability. This also improves students' language application ability through English writing courses. In addition, this paper designs an English language and literature teaching system. With the support and guidance of the English intelligent teaching system, it analyzes the learning level and weaknesses and puts forward teaching suggestions. Then, data mining technology is used to find the key information in the answers from the massive data and is applied to English teaching. In the English learning test, the average attitude of the experimental class was 1.3314 points. This research will effectively solve the problem of English major courses.

JOURNAL OF LOSS PREVENTION IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES			English	Article						artificial intelligence; accident; out of control; prediction		The European Directive 96/82/EC forces industries to know exactly what substances may be generated during loss of control of an industrial chemical process. The study must be as accurate as possible, as the design of the safety measures that will be ready in case a real loss of control occurs depends on these results. Chemical reactions under out of control conditions, follow defined but difficult to know rules, specially at high temperatures showing high molecular complexity. It seems that the application of artificial intelligence techniques will help to predict which substances are produced given an initial chemical scenario. In this paper the k-nearest algorithm and its application to this problem will be studied. A database has been developed to manage reactive information independently from the algorithm or technique of AI to be applied. The most important information of the database are relations between substances present on the initial reactive scenario and the ones detected after reaction under out of control conditions occurred. Chemical substances contained in the database have been analysed by decomposing them into Benson's Groups, which is thought to be the most adequate level of detail to preserve chemical information while establishing relations between non-identical substances. The Shepard's modification of k-nearest neighbor algorithm has been used for the Boolean prediction of formation of a certain substance given a reactive scenario. Results show an accuracy above 95%.

J	Lu, H; Wang, HW; Yu, DH; Ye, J				Lu, Hui; Wang, Hongwei; Yu, Dihua; Ye, Jian			Sharp schedule compression in urgent emergency construction projects via activity crashing, substitution and overlapping: a case study of <i>Huoshengshan</i> and <i>Leishenshan</i> Hospital projects in Wuhan	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						COVID-19; Urgent emergency projects; Schedule compression; Crashing; Substitution; Overlapping	DESIGN; REWORK; COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION; SAFETY; IMPACT; SPACE; MODEL	Purpose To meet the rapidly increasing demand for medical treatment during the outbreak of COVID-19, Huoshengshan and Leishenshan Hospital are rapidly built (9-12 days) in Wuhan. These two urgent emergency projects are unprecedented. In general, substantial literature suggests that the possibility of shortening a schedule by more than a quarter of its original duration is implausible. By contrast, the two projects had successfully compressed the schedules from months and years to about ten days. This study aims to investigate how this was done and provide references for future projects. Design/methodology/approach The study uses qualitative case study techniques to analyze the project practices in two urgent emergency projects. Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews and archival research. During interviews, interviewees were asked to describe the project practices adopted to overcome the challenges and freely share their experiences and knowledge. Findings The results illustrate that a high degree of schedule compression is achievable through tactful crashing, substitution and overlapping applications. The successful practices heavily rely on the high capacity of participants and necessary organization, management and technology innovations, such as three-level matrix organizational structure, reverse design method, site partition, mock-up room first strategies and prefabricated construction technology. For instance, the reverse design method is one of the most significant innovations to project simplification and accelerate and worthy of promotion for future emergency projects. Practical implications The empirical findings are significant as they evoke new thinking and direction for addressing the main challenges of sharp schedule compression and provide valuable references for future emergency projects, including selecting high-capacity contractors and replacing the conventional design methods with reverse design. Originality/value Substantial studies indicate that the maximum degree of schedule compression is highly unlikely to exceed 25%, but this study suggests that sharp compression is possible. Although with flaws in its beauty (i.e. compressing schedule at the expense of construction cost and quality), it is also a breakthrough. It provides the building block for future research in this fertile and unexplored area.

J	Giurgiutiu, V; Bayoumi, AME; Nall, G				Giurgiutiu, V; Bayoumi, AME; Nall, G			Mechatronics and smart structures: emerging engineering disciplines for the third millennium	MECHATRONICS			English	Article								This paper tackles the impact that Mechatronics and Smart Structures disciplines have on the engineering education in the new millennium. Mechatronics is all emerging engineering area that will likely alter the fundamental nature of engineering education ill the disciplines of electrical and mechanical engineering. It can provide an academic model for developing multi-disciplinary programs within the engineering college departmental structure that is historically based on the traditional engineering disciplines. Mechatronics integrates the classical Fields of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer engineering, and information technology to establish basic principles for a contemporary engineering design methodology. A mechatronics concentration area in the engineering curriculum would support the synergistic integration of precision mechanical engineering, electronics control, and systems thinking into the design of intelligent products and processes. Smart Structures, a. k. a. Adaptive Structures, a. k. a. Adaptronics, is an emerging engineering field with multiple defining paradigms. One definition is based upon a technology paradigm: "'the integration of actuators, sensors, and controls with a material or structural component". Multi-functional elements form a complete regulator circuit resulting in a novel structure displaying reduced complexity, low weight, high functional density, as well as economic efficiency. Another definition is based upon a science paradigm in an attempt to capture the essence of biologically inspired materials by addressing the goal as creating material systems with intelligence and life-like features integrated in the microstructure of the material system to reduce mass and energy and produce adaptive functionality. Their basic characteristics of efficiency, functionality, precision, self-repair, and durability continue to fascinate designers of engineering structures today. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The effect of various initial process factors during a practical process on the sintered properties in LTCC fabrication was investigated. Experiments with chosen process factors were designed by using the Taguchi method of 'design of experiment (DOE)'. The results were analyzed by using statistical methods. The filler ratio and the sintering temperature showed considerable effect on the 3p bending strength and the binder amount and the casting speed affected the sintered density. In the sintered body, three crystalline phases, silica, anorthite and alumina, co-existed. With increasing sintering temperature, the amounts of silica and alumina were reduced while that of anorthite increased, as was calculated from their XRD intensities. However, little correlation existed between the crystallinity and either the sintered density or the 3p bending strength. The sintered density and the 3p-strength are thought to be related to the microstructure of the sintered body rather than to the crystallinity.

THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY			English	Article						Online training; Creativity; Active learning; Passive learning; Cognitive style	HYPERMEDIA NAVIGATION; THINKING SKILLS; 21ST-CENTURY; ENHANCEMENT	While online education has become a new trend for knowledge acquisition and skill development, empirical studies on the effectiveness of online creativity training are scarce and the findings are inconclusive. In the current study, we investigated whether individual differences in cognitive style (i.e., FD-field dependence, FI-field independence) influence learners' performance in online creativity training. The literature suggests that when processing information, FD learners tend to prefer inductive learning and rely on external references while the FI learners are more likely to prefer deductive learning and rely on internal reference. A three-day online training was developed and delivered to participants via either the active or the passive training strategy. This study was a pre-posttest between-subjects design, and three creativity tasks (AUT-alternative uses task, visual imagination task, and the design problem) were used to measure participants' creative performance. The MANOVA results showed a significant interaction effects that FD participants greatly improved on performance of the AUT and the design problem after exposing to the active training compared to the passive training, whereas the FI participants did not show improvement. Besides, the FD participants reported positive training experiences (preference and motivation) on the active training strategy while the FI participants didn't seem to differ in their experiences of different training strategies. The current findings implicate that instructor and teachers should be aware of the individual differences while designing creativity training materials/courses in digital as well as real-life contexts.

By a newly devised test battery of music-perception skills, however, we were able to identify among a group of 12 patients with acute hemispheric stroke six patients with music perception deficits (amusia) while six others had no such deficits. In addition we recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in a passive listening task with frequent standard and infrequent pitch deviants designed to elicit the mismatch negativity (MMN). The MMN in the patients with amusia was grossly reduced, while the non-amusic patients and control subjects had MMNs of equal size. These data show that amusia is quite common in unselected stroke patients. The MMN reduction suggests that amusia is related to unspecific automatic stimulus classification deficits in these patients. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Such contamination may arise from laboratory or reagent sources or from physical exchange between samples. This study seeks to rigorously assess the behavior of this often-neglected between-sample contamination. Using unique bacteria, each assigned a particular well in a plate, we assess the frequency at which sequences from each source appear in other wells. We evaluate the effects of different DNA extraction methods performed in two laboratories using a consistent plate layout, including blanks and low-biomass and high-biomass samples. Well-to-well contamination occurred primarily during DNA extraction and, to a lesser extent, in library preparation, while barcode leakage was negligible. Laboratories differed in the levels of contamination. Extraction methods differed in their occurrences and levels of well-to-well contamination, with plate methods having more well-to-well contamination and single-tube methods having higher levels of background contaminants. Well-to-well contamination occurred primarily in neighboring samples, with rare events up to 10 wells apart. This effect was greatest in samples with lower biomass and negatively impacted metrics of alpha and beta diversity. Our work emphasizes that sample contamination is a combination of cross talk from nearby wells and background contaminants. To reduce well-to-well effects, samples should be randomized across plates, samples of similar biomasses should be processed together, and manual single-tube extractions or hybrid plate-based cleanups should be employed. Researchers should avoid simplistic removals of taxa or operational taxonomic units (OTUs) appearing in negative controls, as many will be microbes from other samples rather than reagent contaminants. IMPORTANCE Microbiome research has uncovered magnificent biological and chemical stories across nearly all areas of life science, at times creating controversy when findings reveal fantastic descriptions of microbes living and even thriving in what were once thought to be sterile environments. Scientists have refuted many of these claims because of contamination, which has led to robust requirements, including the use of controls, for validating accurate portrayals of microbial communities. In this study, we describe a previously undocumented form of contamination, well-to-well contamination, and show that this sort of contamination primarily occurs during DNA extraction rather than PCR, is highest with plate-based methods compared to single-tube extraction, and occurs at a higher frequency in low-biomass samples. This finding has profound importance in the field, as many current techniques to "decontaminate" a data set simply rely on an assumption that microbial reads found in blanks are contaminants from "outside," namely, the reagents or consumables.

Design Quantitative study. Methods Anonymous self-reported questionnaire (adjustment ability scale of outpatients with cancer) responses, patient background information and possible associated factors were collected from 369 cancer outpatients. Results The mean +/- SD adjustment ability score was 110.5 +/- 27.2. Several factors were associated with adjustment ability. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General Scale, used to measure quality of life (QOL), was significantly higher in people with an adjustment ability score >95. The factor that was most related to the adjustment ability score was how people think about asking for support from others. The adjustment ability was higher among people who thought, "I should be supported by others for the things I cannot do by myself".

HEALTH ECONOMICS			English	Article						qualitative methods; standard gambles; preferences; separability; considering others	CONTINGENT VALUATION; HEALTH-CARE; SAFETY; STATES; QALYS	Standard gamble (SG) is commonly used to elicit preferences in order to assess health related quality of life. There has been little qualitative research exploring how respondents answer such questions. An SG study was designed to elicit values for the health states associated with anti-hypertensive medication, stroke and cardiovascular disease. This paper describes a qualitative study that was carried out alongside the SG exercise in order to document the thought processes respondents bring to bear in formulating their responses. Data were generated using 'think aloud' techniques and semi-structured interviews. Values were generally well-constructed: responses were thoroughly considered, and respondents made complex trade-offs and arrived at a point of indifference. However, some respondents incorporated inappropriate information into their choices, redefining the hypothetical 'Option B' resulting in problems interpreting the probabilistic information. Consideration of non-health factors was commonplace, in particular the impact of choices on others. We discuss these findings in terms of the use of qualitative methods in health economics and the wider discourse surrounding the theoretical underpinnings of health state valuation.

Who are the smokers who never plan to quit and what do they think about the risks of using tobacco products?	ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Article							NICOTINE DELIVERY-SYSTEMS; CURRENT CIGARETTE-SMOKING; MENTAL-ILLNESS; UNITED-STATES; CESSATION RESOURCES; ADULTS; PERCEPTION; TRUST; WORLDVIEWS; INFORMATION	Introduction Smoking cigarettes is the most harmful way to use tobacco. Smokers who do not plan to quit present a particular challenge in reducing the morbidity and mortality from tobacco use. Switching to a lower harm product might encourage them to end their use of combusted cigarettes. This study aimed to better understand smokers who do not intend to quit (including their demographic and worldviews as indicators of their social, cultural, and political dispositions) and their perceived risks of cigarettes and possible lower-risk products such as e-cigarettes. Methods: Participants were 2572 current smokers. Data were pooled from 2015 and 2016 cross-sectional surveys of national probability samples of U.S. adults and analyzed with multivariable logistic regressions. Results: Smokers who never plan to quit comprise 14.3% of current U.S. smokers and are more likely to be older (24.2% among 65 + years old vs. 9.8% among 18-24) and less likely to have ever used e-cigarettes. A one-unit increase in hierarchical worldview (measured on a 1-6 scale) was associated with a 20% increase in the odds of never planning to quit. Those who denied that cigarettes cause disease or death (aORs between 1.6 and 2.0) or were uncertain (aORs: 2.5-2.7) were more likely to never plan to quit compared to those who agreed. They did not view risks of e-cigarettes substantially different compared to smokers who plan to quit. Conclusion: One in seven U.S. smokers never plans to quit and might benefit from interventions which reflect their hierarchical worldviews and increase their risk perceptions of combustible cigarettes.

With a wealth of research dedicated to the topic, it is still unclear what determines fake news sharing. This paper comparatively examines fake and accurate news sharing in a novel experimental setting that manipulates news about terrorism.Design/methodology/approach-The authors follow an extended version of the uses-and-gratification framework for news sharing, complemented by variables commonly employed in fake news rebuttal studies.Findings-Logistic regression and classification trees revealed worry about the topic, media literacy, information-seeking and conservatism as significant predictors of willingness to share news online. No significant association was found for general analytical thinking, journalism skepticism, conspiracy ideation, uses-and-gratification motives or pass-time coping strategies.Practical implications-The current results broaden and expand the literature examining beliefs in and sharing of misinformation, highlighting the role of media literacy in protecting the public against the spread of fake news.Originality/value-This is, to the authors' knowledge, the first study to integrate a breadth of theoretically and empirically driven predictors of fake news sharing within a single experimental framework.

J	Segundo, JP				Pedro Segundo, Jose			A history of spike trains as Point Processes in neural coding	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-PARIS			English	Article						Spike trains; Point Processes; Neural coding	SINGLE NEURONS	The history of viewing spike trains as point processes along time is that of the inference that spike trains participate in neural codings. A characteristic thought process, the "Conceptual Framework", present always and with sequential components, upholds the logic of this view. Early research in the 1920's introduced the view: experiments, though largely primitive, were designed and interpreted adequately and thus demonstrated convincingly this role. Modern research, starting around 1950, has contributed impressively. Essential was the mathematical Theory of Point Processes that permitted rigorous studies; computer implementation, though no substitute for clear thinking, was enormously helpful. Contributions, besides confirming the key inference, include wide-range train participation in neural codings, with many courses of action and formal implications involving neuronal performances individually and in networks, discharge forms, dynamic behaviors, critical Information and Communication issues, etc. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

That is to say, the dead-zone dynamics may be thought of as a generic high-dimensional convex set, and the introduction of two methods distinguishes our works in seeking the GNE of non-cooperative games. On the one hand, a two-time-scale structure based on singular perturbation method is led into the design of GNE seeking algorithm, where the fast dynamics part rapidly eliminates the influence of input dead-zone, and the slow dynamics part drives the players' action to the GNE. On the other hand, adaptive penalty method is utilized to ensure the player's action enters the inequality constraints set without a prior estimation of centralized information for penalty parameters. The algorithm in this paper realizes complete distribution and param-eter independence, making it easy to apply in practical programming. At last, several numerical examples regarding the electricity markets are employed to verify the effective-ness of the theoretical results.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Ahmed, RR; Zhang, XQ				Ahmed, Rana Rabnawaz; Zhang, Xueqing			Multi-layer value stream assessment of the reverse logistics network for inert construction waste management	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Reverse logistics; Inert construction waste; Network design; Value stream mapping; Indicator performance; Sustainability; Lean management	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; MUNICIPAL SOLID-WASTE; COMPARATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION; SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; MAPPING SUS-VSM; DEMOLITION WASTE; RECYCLED CONSTRUCTION; AGGREGATE PRODUCTION; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; ROUTING PROBLEM	Reverse logistics (RL) concepts have brought sustainable solutions to the problems pertinent to inert construction waste (ICW) management. However, the involvement of different processes and facilities across the RL value chain makes it difficult to visualize and manage the whole process conveniently. Consequently, issues such as inadequate assessment of environmental hazards, unclear cost accrual patterns, misleading information to stakeholders, and other process-related deficiencies arise, thereby questioning the overall sustainability and alike circularity concepts. Despite the prominent role of lean management (LM) concepts in process improvements across various product-oriented sectors, its integration within RL management to solve ICW problems is almost non-existent. This paper presents a unique lean thinking-based multi-layer value stream assessment (MVSA) approach deriving from a conventional value stream mapping (VSM) technique to assess the overall RL network of ICW management. RL network design entails both facility-based and non-facility-based processes, with four different value streams, i.e., time, cost, environmental quality, and process efficiency aspects. A case study of Hong Kong demonstrates the developed MVSA approach. The case study features an assessment of the RL network's current and future states, considering multiple scenarios. Furthermore, a detailed sensitivity analysis is conducted to provide valuable insights and discussions. In the end, an agenda for continuous improvement related to the proposed MVSA approach is expounded. The research findings verify that the proposed MVSA approach can significantly contribute to the overall process improvement, better visualization, and RL network assessment, leading to effective waste management systems.

Following identification of ISAV-specific clones from a cDNA library, a rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR strategy was designed to obtain the sequence of the full length mRNA transcript. The full length open reading frame (ORF) of this gene was shown to be 2169 nucleotides in length, encoding a putative protein of 722 aa. This sequence was demonstrated by RT-PCR to be specific to ISAV-infected cell cultures. The start codon of this ORF was preceded by the ISAV consensus sequence 5' GCTAAGA 3' indicating the full 5' end of the gene to have been obtained. Based on protein size and amino acid composition, this protein was shown to be similar to the PB2 protein of other orthomyxoviruses. Furthermore, a bipartite nuclear localisation signal was identified in the C-terminus of the protein as is found on all of the influenza virus P proteins. Expression of the putative PB2 as a green fluorescent marker protein-fusion protein confirmed that this protein exhibited nuclear localisation in a fish cell line. Sequences of the ISAV segment 1 gene were obtained from Scottish, Norwegian and Canadian ISAV isolates. Analyses confirmed the close genetic relationship between Norwegian and Scottish ISAV and indicated that this segment was among the most conserved of the ISAV genes identified to date. Thus, this evidence strongly suggests that the genomic segment 1 of ISAV encodes a polymerase protein which is thought to be analagous in function to the PB2 protein of influenza viruses.

J	Kosova, F; Simsek, HN; Çelik, N				Kosova, Funda; Simsek, Hanife Nurseven; Celik, Nurcan			Evaluation of the clinical self-efficacy of postgraduate midwifery students who took courses related to biochemistry: a cross-sectional study	TURKISH JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY-TURK BIYOKIMYA DERGISI			English	Article						biochemistry; midwifery; postgraduate; self-efficacy; biyokimya; Ebelik; lisansustu; oz-yeterlilik	CONFIDENCE; MIDWIVES; PERCEPTIONS; EDUCATION; IMPACT	Objectives Postgraduate midwifery students learn the science and art of midwifery in clinical settings through the integration of evidence-based knowledge, practical skills, quality of care, and personal attitudes. These personal attitudes are confidence, intuition, problem solving, critical thinking, and self-efficacy. This study's goal was to evaluate the clinical self-efficacy of midwifery students who took courses related to biochemistry in the postgraduate education program. Methods A cross-sectional design was used in the study. In the study, data collection was performed using surveys from students in the postgraduate midwifery education program. The study data were collected by employing the "Introductory Information Form" and the "Self-efficacy for Clinical Evaluation Scale." Data evaluation was performed by number, percentage, mean, and correlation test. Results It was revealed that 67.7% of midwifery students who took the courses were postgraduate students in the thesis stage, 41% of them worked in secondary health services, and 51.6% of them had a clinical experience of 5 years and more. The total score of the self-efficacy perception subscale was 4.22 +/- 0.49 (1-5), whereas the total score of the perceived confidence subscale was 4.57 +/- 0.45 (1-5). There was a statistically significant correlation between the self-efficacy subscale and the importance subscale. Conclusions The results indicated that postgraduate midwifery students had high clinical self-efficacy scores. We think that the elective courses related to biochemistry in the postgraduate midwifery education program may have positively affected their clinical skills. We anticipate that it will be appropriate to conduct research with a larger sample size to examine the effect of postgraduate midwifery education on students' clinical self-efficacy.

Swaroop; Haxby, James, V			The neural basis of intelligence in fine-grained cortical topographies	ELIFE			English	Article							REPRESENTATIONAL SPACES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN; DEFAULT; NETWORK; SYSTEMS; CORTEX; COMMON; MODEL; FMRI	Intelligent thought is the product of efficient neural information processing, which is embedded in fine-grained, topographically organized population responses and supported by fine-grained patterns of connectivity among cortical fields. Previous work on the neural basis of intelligence, however, has focused on coarse-grained features of brain anatomy and function because cortical topographies are highly idiosyncratic at a finer scale, obscuring individual differences in fine-grained connectivity patterns. We used a computational algorithm, hyperalignment, to resolve these topographic idiosyncrasies and found that predictions of general intelligence based on fine-grained (vertex-by-vertex) connectivity patterns were markedly stronger than predictions based on coarse-grained (region-by-region) patterns. Intelligence was best predicted by fine-grained connectivity in the default and frontoparietal cortical systems, both of which are associated with self-generated thought. Previous work overlooked fine-grained architecture because existing methods could not resolve idiosyncratic topographies, preventing investigation where the keys to the neural basis of intelligence are more likely to be found.

Study Design A meta-analysis (Prospero; CRD42021259723) was conducted to quantify and compare the strength of the associations between ToM and the clinical symptoms of SSD (Positive, Negative, Cognitive/Disorganization, Depression/Anxiety, Excitability/Hostility). Studies (N = 130, 137 samples) including people with SSD and reporting a correlation between clinical symptoms and ToM were retrieved from Pubmed, PsycNet, Embase, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Proquest, WorldCat, and Open Gray. Correlations for each dimension and each symptom were entered into a random-effect model using a Fisher's r-to-z transformation and were compared using focused-tests. Publication bias was assessed with the Rosenthal failsafe and by inspecting the funnel plot and the standardized residual histogram. Study Results The Cognitive/Disorganization (Zr = 0.28) and Negative (Zr = 0.24) dimensions revealed a small to moderate association with ToM, which was significantly stronger than the other dimensions. Within the Cognitive/Disorganization dimension, Difficulty in abstract thinking (Zr = 0.36) and Conceptual disorganization (Zr = 0.39) showed the strongest associations with ToM. The association with the Positive dimension (Zr = 0.16) was small and significantly stronger than the relationship with Depression/Anxiety (Zr = 0.09). Stronger associations were observed between ToM and clinical symptoms in younger patients, those with an earlier age at onset of illness and for tasks assessing a combination of different mental states. Conclusions The relationships between Cognitive/Disorganization, Negative symptoms, and ToM should be considered in treating individuals with SSD.

J	Dahan, E; Hauser, JR				Dahan, E; Hauser, JR			The virtual customer	JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CONJOINT-ANALYSIS; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; CONSUMER RESEARCH; MONTE-CARLO; CYCLE-TIME; MODELS; INFORMATION; PREFERENCES; ROBUSTNESS; ALGORITHM	Communication and information technologies are adding new capabilities for rapid and inexpensive customer input to all stages of the product development (PD) process. In this article we review six web-based methods of customer input as examples of the improved Internet capabilities of communication, conceptualization, and computation, For each method we give examples of user-interfaces, initial applications, and validity tests. We critique the applicability of the methods for use in the various stages of PD and discuss how they complement existing methods. For example, during the fuzzy front end of PD the information pump enables customers to interact with each other in a web-based game that provides incentives for truth-telling and thinking hard, thus providing new ways for customers to verbalize the product features that are important to them. Fast polyhedral adaptive conjoint estimation enables PD teams to screen larger numbers of product features inexpensively to identify and measure the importance of the most promising features for further development. Meanwhile, interactive web-based conjoint analysis interfaces are moving this proven set of methods to the web while exploiting new capabilities to present products, features, product use, and marketing elements in streaming multimedia representations. User design exploits the interactivity of the web to enable users to design their own virtual products thus enabling the PD team to understand complex feature interactions and enabling customers to learn their own preferences for new products. These methods can be valuable for identifying opportunities, improving the design and engineering of products, and testing ideas and concepts much earlier in the process when less time and money is at risk. As products move toward pretesting and testing, virtual concept testing on the web enables PD teams to test concepts without actually building the product. Further, by combining virtual concepts and the ability of customers to interact with one another in a stock-market-like game, securities trading of concepts provides a novel way to identify winning concepts. Prototypes of all six methods are available and have been tested with real products and real customers. These tests demonstrate reliability for web-based conjoint analysis, polyhedral methods, virtual concept testing, and stock-market-like trading; external validity for web-based conjoint analysis and polyhedral methods and consistency for web-based conjoint analysis versus user design. We report on these tests, commercial applications, and other evaluations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All tights reserved.

Some proposed methodologies try to get the necessary information from the schema and from the content of the database, paying little attention to the analysis of the usage that the programs make of the data, while this can be thought as the most reliable source of information.

Exploring context-awareness for ubiquitous computing in the healthcare domain	PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING			English	Article							INFORMATION	Ubiquitous technologies have potentials to play major roles in different real world organizational settings. One of the areas where applying ubiquitous technologies has been given a lot of attention is in the healthcare domain. Here, users are frequently on the move while at the same time relying increasingly on centralized computerized information. In this paper, we explore ubiquitous technologies in the real world through two studies in the healthcare domain. First, we look at the use and usability of a ubiquitous electronic patient record (EPR) system distributed on desktop and laptop computers throughout a large hospital. Secondly, we present an extension to this ubiquitous computing environment in the form of a context-aware mobile computer terminal prototype. The usability of the mobile EPR prototype was evaluated in both laboratory and field settings. Our results indicate that the usefulness of a ubiquitous computing environment supporting work activities in healthcare can benefit from context-aware mobile information access. However, interaction design for such systems must be carefully thought out and thoroughly evaluated. Also, while the use of mobile and stationary computers complement each other very well, we found that the usefulness of ubiquitous computing environments in healthcare may benefit from additional elements such as situated displays at key locations and on key objects, and from seamless integration between the different devices comprising the system as a whole.

CCDS in this setting aligns with policies to increase IT use in ambulance care, enhance paramedic decision-making skills, reduce avoidable emergency department attendances and improve quality of care and patient experience. This qualitative study was conducted alongside a cluster randomised trial in two ambulance services of the costs and effects of web-based CCDS system designed to support paramedic decision-making in the care of older people following a fall. Paramedics were trained to enter observations and history for relevant patients on a tablet, and the CCDS then generated a recommended course of action which could be logged. Our aim was to describe paramedics' experience of the CCDS intervention and to identify factors affecting its implementation and use. Methods: We invited all paramedics who had been randomly allocated to the intervention arm of the trial to participate in interviews or focus groups. The study was underpinned by Strong Structuration Theory, a theoretical model for studying innovation based on the relationship between what people do and their context. We used the Framework approach to data analysis. Results: Twenty out of 22 paramedics agreed to participate. We developed a model of paramedic experience of CCDS with three domains: context, adoption and use, and outcomes. Aspects of context which had an impact included organisational culture and perceived support for non-conveyance decisions. Experience of adoption and use of the CCDS varied between individual paramedics, with some using it with all eligible patients, some only with patients they thought were 'suitable' and some never using it. A range of outcomes were reported, some of which were different from the intended role of the technology in decision support. Conclusion: Implementation of new technology such as CCDS is not a one-off event, but an ongoing process, which requires support at the organisational level to be effective.

Valence and difficulty of retrieval as moderators of the effect of meta-stereotype activation on intergroup orientations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Meta-stereotypes; Difficulty of retrieval; Intergroup bias; Intergroup contact	METACOGNITIVE EXPERIENCES; SOCIAL IMAGE; PREJUDICE; CONTACT; EASE; AVAILABILITY; INDIVIDUALS; INFORMATION; ATTITUDES; MEMBERS	Previous research indicates that meta-stereotypes are predominantly negative. However, the valence of the meta-stereotypes may not be the only factor accounting for the detrimental effects associated with their activation. In addition to valence, we propose that the subjective difficulty of retrieving the meta-stereotype might critically determine whether its activation deteriorates intergroup orientations. An experimental study showed that the effect of the meta-stereotype activation on the desire to interact with outgroup members was moderated by the interaction between the valence of the meta-stereotype and its difficulty of retrieval. In particular, the activation of a positive meta-stereotype deteriorated intergroup orientations when the difficulty of retrieval was high as compared with a condition in which the difficulty of retrieval was low.

J	Bierwagen, GP; Tallman, DE				Bierwagen, GP; Tallman, DE			Choice and measurement of crucial aircraft coatings system properties	PROGRESS IN ORGANIC COATINGS			English	Article						adhesion; abrasion; aircraft coatings system; corrosion protection; camouflage optics; solvent resistance	ORGANIC COATINGS; NOISE RESISTANCE; ELECTROCHEMICAL IMPEDANCE; CORROSION; DURABILITY; PIGMENT; PAINT; PERFORMANCE; EPOXY	All components of an aerospace coatings system must be functioning properly for it to provide all of the elements of physical protection and optical performance that it was designed to provide. To insure proper coatings system functions over its desired lifetime, one must have the capability to define, measure and evaluate those system properties that determine these functions in use. For military aircraft, the desired properties can be summarized as mechanical/chemical protection of the airframe with controlled electromagnetic emission and reflection properties. This is easily enough said, but difficult to achieve in practice. There are many possible properties one can measure on an aerospace coatings system and the cohort of designers and users of these systems are uncertain of which is the absolute correct set of measurements to choose. They seek the set that gives the maximum amount of pertinent information at the least amount of effort and expense. The sine qua non of such properties has yet to be determined, but the current "best practice" thinking among the coatings science community focuses on system flexibility, adhesion, solvent resistance, corrosion protection and camouflage optics as determined over the coatings lifetime while taking into account the effects of UV exposure, hot and cold organic fluids, sea water, humidity and temperature cycling, mechanical stressing and abrasion. All of these must be considered in choosing the tests/results protocol that the coatings/pretreatment must undergo to be "fit for use." We will discuss the current thinking on the measurements/exposures for aerospace coatings as well as the accuracy/validity that they provide in practice. We will concentrate on spectral, optical and electrochemical testing of coatings system properties and their changes in simulated and field exposure. The differences between test performance and real use performance will be considered, especially with respect to film application uniformity and film damage. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Kansky, R				Kansky, Ruth			Unpacking the challenges of wildlife governance in community-based conservation programs to promote human-wildlife coexistence	CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE			English	Article						collaborative governance; human-wildlife conflict; participatory dialogues; systems thinking; wildlife governance	NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; PARTICIPATION; CONFLICT; IMPACTS; SUCCESS; COMMONS; DESIGN	One of the numerous global challenges today is how to promote biodiversity persistence and at the same time reduce poverty and improve livelihoods, especially in multiple-use landscapes shared by people and wildlife. In such landscapes, where the cost of sharing the landscape with large wildlife can be high, Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) program is a model promoted to offset negative wildlife impacts. However, such programs, that promote sustainable utilization of wildlife, are not always successful. To better understand how CBNRM governance systems enable or hinder human-wildlife coexistence, I implemented an 11-weeks participatory co-learning program in conservancies in the Zambezi region of Namibia. Framing human-wildlife relationships as occurring within complex social-ecological systems, participatory dialogues were used to unpack the system to better understand why human-wildlife conflict remains a challenge after 30 years of CBNRM in Namibia. From listening to communities I identified five key areas requiring improvement: (1) inefficient communication and transfer of information between management and community; (2) lack of policy and process clarity; (3) lack of support, knowledge, resources, and implementation of mitigation measures; (4) lack of accountability by both management and conservancy members; and (5) lack of skills and capacity by both management and conservancy members. To address these problem areas, I propose three key priority actions: (1) harmonize conservancy policies and management practices; (2) improve information flow; and (3) implement an adaptive management mitigation measure program. While this study focused on a small part of Namibia, I expect this methodology and many of the key findings and proposed interventions will be relevant for other areas applying collaborative approaches to improve human-wildlife coexistence.

J	Vecchio, Y; Pauselli, G; Adinolfi, F				Vecchio, Yari; Pauselli, Gregorio; Adinolfi, Felice			Exploring Attitudes toward Animal Welfare through the Lens of Subjectivity-An Application of Q-Methodology	ANIMALS			English	Article						animal welfare; opinions; Q-methodology; policymaking; discourses	PUBLIC-ATTITUDES; DEMOCRACY; PERSPECTIVES; GOVERNANCE; DISCOURSES; BEHAVIORS; INSIGHTS; SCIENCE; CITIZEN; VIEWS	Simple Summary In this paper, we offer a methodological solution to the policymaker to improve the structure of the surveys used for public consultations. Over the years, we noticed the importance of opinions in legislative processes, particularly in animal welfare. The issue, to which European citizens have historically been sensitive, has been the target of multiple consultations aimed at considering perceptions about farming conditions. However, standard surveys suffer from bias and design errors. To overcome these problems, we propose the use of Q-methodology to understand the opinions of veterinary students. The results contribute to the improvement of traditional surveys used to understand what people think about animal welfare and could be useful in providing information to the policy making process. Opinions increasingly influence legislative processes. The case of animal welfare (AW) standards is a clear example of the role played by opinions in political decisions. The issue, to which European citizens have historically been sensitive, has been the subject of numerous consultations and investigations, aimed at considering citizens' opinions regarding breeding conditions. However, these tools and in particular standard surveys, suffer from response biases such as the prejudices involved in the design of questions and the interpretation of the results. To mitigate these problems, we used the Q-methodology, which is an inductive but systematic methodology focused on patterns that explain the ideas of individuals. The purposive sample consisted of 36 veterinary students who were acquiring scientific knowledge about AW. The results, in addition to providing policymakers with food for thought for the further development of AW standards, contribute to testing the use of alternative methodologies to collect citizens' views. This mapping of viewpoints helps to build a more effective form of AW policy making.

J	Xu, CY; Song, C				Xu, Chunyan; Song, Cai			Optimization of Innovation and Entrepreneurship Education and Training System in Colleges and Universities Based on OpenStack Cloud Computing	SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING			English	Article								With economic globalization and rapid development of science and technology, many colleges and universities pay more and more attention to the cultivation of students' innovative thinking and creativity, and innovation and entrepreneurship education has also become an important part of the education system. Due to the current unevenness of teachers in innovation and entrepreneurship education in colleges and universities, high training cost, and lack of strong atmosphere, this paper optimizes the innovation and entrepreneurship education and training system in colleges and universities through OpenStack cloud computing. This paper optimizes the cloud computing platform according to the OpenStack virtual machine and the multiobjective ant colony improvement algorithm and then designs the innovation and entrepreneurship education and training system. The multiobjective ant colony improvement algorithm uses the way ants find food to find the best information resource route from the traces left by the information trend in the cloud platform. In order to test the effectiveness of these methods, this paper uses the simulation method to test. The results show that, sometimes, the load utilization rate of the innovation and entrepreneurship education and training system in colleges and universities exceeds 80%, which is in line with the expected settings. Through the OpenStack cloud computing platform, it can provide a good innovation and entrepreneurship training environment for more users at low cost and low risk and promote the development of innovation and entrepreneurship education.

J	Haddud, A; DeSouza, A; Khare, A; Lee, H				Haddud, Abubaker; DeSouza, Arthur; Khare, Anshuman; Lee, Huei			Examining potential benefits and challenges associated with the Internet of Things integration in supply chains	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Information technology; Adoption; Risks; Technology; Benefits; Information management; Challenges; Supply chain management; Internet of things (IoT); Value chain; Supply chains	PRODUCT RECOVERY; RFID TECHNOLOGY; IOT; MANAGEMENT; SERVICE; OPTIMIZATION; LOGISTICS; SUCCESS; IMPACT	Purpose: The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to have a huge impact on businesses and, especially, the way we think about supply chain management (SCM). However, there is still a paucity of studies on the impact of IoT adoption on supply chains and on different aspects of the business in general. The purpose of this paper is to examine the perception of the academic community of the impact of the IoT adoption in organizational supply chains with a view to verify potential key benefits and challenges existent in the literature. The research presents the impact on an organization along with the impact across its entire supply chain. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through the use of an online survey and 87 participants completed the survey. Participants were mainly from the academic community and were university scholars based in different countries located in six continents. Participants were authors, or co-authors, of academic papers published in the Decision Science Institute 2015 and 2016 annual conference proceedings, the 21st International Symposium of Sustainable Transport and Supply Chain Innovations, the Supply Chain Management: An International Journal 2016 issues, and the Operations and Supply Chain Management: An International Journal 2016 issues. Findings - The authors were able to confirm the significance of some of the examined potential benefits to individual organizations and their entire supply chains. However, the study identified other potential benefits that were not seen as a direct impact of IoT adoption. Most of the examined potential benefits were found to contribute to a number of critical success factors for implementing successful SCM. The authors were also able to confirm that some of the examined potential challenges were still perceived as key hinders to IoT adoption but examined potential challenges were not seen as hurdles to IoT adoption. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study of its kind. Although some literature attempted to provide an overview about the IoT management, no study has specifically explored potential benefits and challenges related to the adoption of IoT in supply chains and ranked them based on their significance. The results can be beneficial to academic scholars interested in the researched topic, business professionals, organizations within different sectors, and any other party interested in understanding more about the impact of adopting IoT on SCM.

Scott			Affinity of small-molecule solutes to hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and chemically patterned interfaces in aqueous solution	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						inverse design; molecular simulation; membrane fouling; solvation free energy; surface adsorption	PROTEIN ADSORPTION; FREE-ENERGY; SURFACE HYDROPHOBICITY; PEPTIDE ADSORPTION; CARBON NANOTUBES; WATER; MODEL; DYNAMICS; VERSION; FORCE	Performance of membranes for water purification is highly influenced by the interactions of solvated species with membrane surfaces, including surface adsorption of solutes upon fouling. Current efforts toward fouling-resistant membranes often pursue surface hydrophilization, frequently motivated by macroscopic measures of hydrophilicity, because hydrophobicity is thought to increase solute-surface affinity. While this heuristic has driven diverse membrane functionalization strategies, here we build on advances in the theory of hydrophobicity to critically examine the relevance of macroscopic characterizations of solute-surface affinity. Specifically, we use molecular simulations to quantify the affinities to model hydroxyl- and methyl-functionalized surfaces of small, chemically diverse, charge-neutral solutes represented in produced water. We show that surface affinities correlate poorly with two conventional measures of solute hydrophobicity, gas-phase water solubility and oil-water partitioning. Moreover, we find that all solutes show attraction to the hydrophobic surface and most to the hydrophilic one, in contrast to macroscopically based hydrophobicity heuristics. We explain these results by decomposing affinities into direct solute interaction energies (which dominate on hydroxyl surfaces) and water restructuring penalties (which dominate on methyl surfaces). Finally, we use an inverse design algorithm to show how heterogeneous surfaces, with multiple functional groups, can be patterned to manipulate solute affinity and selectivity. These findings, importantly based on a range of solute and surface chemistries, illustrate that conventional macroscopic hydrophobicity metrics can fail to predict solute-surface affinity, and that molecular-scale surface chemical patterning significantly influences affinity-suggesting design opportunities for water purification membranes and other engineered interfaces involving aqueous solute-surface interactions.

J	Schmidt, K; Jacobs, PA; Barton, A				Schmidt, K; Jacobs, PA; Barton, A			Cross-cultural differences in GPs' attitudes towards complementary and alternative medicine: a survey comparing regions of the UK and Germany	COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN MEDICINE			English	Article							GENERAL-PRACTITIONERS	Objective: To investigate whether there is a difference in general practitioners' attitudes towards CAM in the UK and Germany. Study design: A descriptive questionnaire was developed and sent to 97 GPs in the UK and 99 GPs in Germany. Results: The overall response rate was 68%. German GPs showed a (non-significant) overall more positive attitude towards CAM than did British GPs. British GPs made more referrals to complementary practitioners. The most popular CAM therapies that UK GPs referred their patients to were chiropractic treatment, acupuncture and osteopathy. German GPs referred their patients mainly to acupuncture treatment, chiropractic treatment and herbal medicine. A significantly higher number of German GPs reported having practised as a CAM practitioner before and having personally used CAM themselves. Seventy percent of British GPs and 76% of German GPs thought it is safe to prescribe complementary medicine and therapies to patients. Conclusion: There are small national differences in referring patients to various CAM modalities. Both nations have an overall positive attitude toward and a high interest in CAM. Lack of scientific evidence and information on training opportunities were important points that were continuously raised by GPs in both countries. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

They can be a helpful tool for enriching clinical research for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), but the approach has gained little traction in TCM. Information is needed before supporters of the trials can pursue a change to that status. Objective The study intended to obtain data needed to support TCM clinicians' adoption of N-of-1 trials. Methods TCM clinicians were interviewed using a dedicated questionnaire between May 15, 2014, and July 31, 2014. Setting The study took place at 4 teaching hospitals (Lanzhou City, China). Participants Participants were TCM clinicians at the 4 hospitals. Outcome Measures The survey included questions to obtain information on (1) the various methods that the TCM physicians used to obtain information about how to develop and conduct clinical trials, (2) their knowledge and experience with traditional clinical trials, (3) their awareness of the concept and methodology of N-of-1 trials, and (4) their needs and willingness to receive training about such trials. Descriptive statistics were used. Results One-hundred-and-six clinicians, with a median age of 32 +/- 9 y, participated in the survey. Most received information on research methods from a medical database (77%) or academic conferences (65%). Eighty-two percent of the clinicians had read papers about clinical trials, and 84% of the material read were medical articles in Mandarin. Of the participants, 57% had designed and carried out clinical trials during the 5 y before the survey, and among those participants, 26% had performed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 28% had carried out retrospective studies, 16% had conducted observational studies, and 30% had completed case reports. For those studies, the results of 7% had been published in the Science Citation Index (SCI), 47% in the Chinese Science Citation Database (CSCD), and 31% in provincial journals; 15% were unpublished. Only 37% had heard of an N-of-1 trial, and only 5% understood what the term means. Most intermediate clinicians thought it is necessary to train different groups of clinicians using N-of-1 trials that included clinicians and patients. Conclusions The results highlight the possible interest of TCM clinicians in the methods of N-of-1 trials; meanwhile, the study's data stress the need for appropriate medical education and recommendations based on available evidence. Further efforts in the area should emphasize the benefits for patients and funders. The training is necessary in TCM clinical practice to improve the evidence quality of studies on TCM.

In this research we describe distributed experimental environment for BW which was designed to obtain better results and can thus eliminate the problems of traditional BW technique. The actual experimental system is an integration of three BW modes with mutually different features and characters. We conducted three different tests implementing this environment, and confirmed quality and quantity of ideas generated by three different groups. It was confirmed that unrestricted inputs are effective in generating a large quantity of ideas, whereas limiting the number of sharable/viewable ideas shows better tendency in some aspects. However, qualitative evaluation results were not confirmed as different functions show variant results. The evaluation of the functions that support viewing and sharing of ideas show that synergy is not always an advantage in generating ideas. The results of number of ideas in correlation with time show that 20 minutes time was appropriate to conduct BW in distributed environment.

The literature indicates a general consensus that clinical decision support systems are thought to have the potential to improve care. Evidence is more equivocal for guidelines and for systems to aid physicians with diagnosis. There also is general consensus that a variety of systems are little used despite demonstrated or potential benefits. In the evaluation literature, the main emphasis is on how clinical performance changes. Most studies use an experimental or randomized controlled clinical trials design (RCT) to assess system performance or to focus on changes in clinical performance that could affect patient care. Few studies involve field tests of a CDSS and almost none use a naturalistic design in routine clinical settings with real patients. In addition, there is little theoretical discussion, although papers are permeated by a rationalist perspective that excludes contextual issues related to how and why systems are used. The studies mostly concern physicians rather than other clinicians. Further, CDSS evaluation studies appear to be insulated from evaluations of other informatics applications: Consequently, there is a lack of information useful for understanding why CDSSs may or may not be effective, resulting in making less informed decisions about these technologies and, by extension, other medical informatics applications.

J	Kuo, YC; Chang, PJ				Kuo, Yu-Chen; Chang, Po-Jung			Flipped classroom combined with WPACQ learning mode on student learning effect - exemplified by program design courses	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Early Access						Flipped classroom; WSQ learning mode; Programming learning; Peer learning; Corrections strategy	COGNITIVE-LOAD; STRATEGIES; EDUCATION; ACHIEVEMENT; PERFORMANCE; LANGUAGE; THINKING; SKILLS	In recent years, many schools have started implementing remote teaching due to the impact of the COVID-19. Flipped classroom has been proven to be a student-centered teaching method that can effectively improve learning effectiveness. Nonetheless, if students fail to watch the instructional videos prior to class or encounter difficulties during the learning process, it can result in unfavorable learning outcomes. Therefore, this study proposes the use of the flipped classroom combined with the WPACQ learning model for programming courses. During the pre-class phase, students engage in online collaboration with their classmates, working together to accomplish the tasks outlined in the flipped classroom learning sheet. They actively share essential summaries with peers, engage in collective problem-solving of concepts and processes, all with the ultimate goal of enhancing the effectiveness of their learning experience.This study will develop a learning system that combines the flipped classroom with the WPACQ learning model, guiding learners to adopt the WPACQ learning strategy. In this system, the experimental group learners go through stages including watching instructional videos (Watch), guided outline-style note-taking with peers (Peer-Summary), unit test (Assessment), error correction (Correction), and final questioning (Question). Through viewing peer-summary key notes and engaging in error correction activities with peers, learners cultivate the ability to summarize key points and deepen their understanding of the learning content. They reflect on their own learning process to identify areas for improvement. The research results demonstrate that learners who adopt the flipped classroom combined with the WPACQ learning model exhibit better learning effectiveness compared to those using the conventional flipped classroom learning model. Furthermore, this approach effectively helps learners enhance their learning motivation, self-efficacy, reflective abilities, programming learning attitudes, and reduce cognitive load.

This can leave students overwhelmed, slow the pace of their learning, and lower their motivation. We find that carefully designed multimedia summaries in the form of one-minute videos and short text summaries can significantly increase students' understanding of the material as well as their ability to organize information into a useful mental framework, as measured by their performances on a concept mapping exercise and a conceptual test of learning. Notably, we show that these improvements can be achieved with negligible increase in overall time students spend on the course material each week. We discuss reasons why these short postlecture summaries helped students learn more, namely, that (i) they likely increased students' ability to chunk and organize information while minimizing the extraneous cognitive load imposed by the materials, and (ii) they likely improved students' ability to consolidate and transfer knowledge through the use of contrasting cases. We provide a set of detailed recommendations that instructors can use to develop effective postlecture multimedia summaries. We suggest that one of the most important and impactful recommendations is incorporating student thinking in the design of these types of summaries informed by the input of qualified former students or teaching assistants with significant experience interacting with students in the course.

Our findings have implications for the way we think about collaborative writing as a design problem, in that current conceptualizations of collaborative writing emphasize the work context rather than the work itself, at the cost of understanding interpersonal dynamics that are central to the common process. The findings come from 23 interviews with 32 university researchers and students regarding their experiences with collaborative writing of academic texts. The analysis of these interviews is supplemented with visualizations of the revision histories of documents written by a subset of the study participants. We discuss our findings in terms of fragmented exchanges in common information spaces and consider the shared document as a mediator for the simultaneous accomplishment and negotiation of work.

Several dimensions, such as the media of concept maps, roles of concepts, sample groups, research methods, application domains, learning contexts, research foci, as well as the citation and cocitation relationships, are taken into account based on the technology-based learning model. From the review results, two thematic dusters were found, namely concept map-facilitated knowledge construction in collaborative learning, and concept map-based learning design to improve learning achievement and motivation. The research focused more on the applications in engineering courses, followed by science and language courses, and potential was also found in arts, business or management, and mathematics. Learning contexts for CMSE are mainly in-class activities, followed by online discussion activities; moreover, it was found that the number of applications in digital game-based teaming contexts is increasing. In terms of research foci, more studies investigated learners' performance, attitude/motivation, and perceptions, while less emphasis was put on developing learners' skills, higher order thinking, as well as collaboration and communication competences. Accordingly, several suggestions for future research of CMSE are provided as a reference for researchers and policy makers.

The article aims to assess the current clinical evidence of yoga for Essential hypertension (EH). Strategy: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library were searched until June, 2013. We included randomized clinical trials testing yoga against conventional therapy, yoga versus no treatment, yoga combined with conventional therapy versus conventional therapy or conventional therapy combined with breath awareness. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane standards. Results: A total of 6 studies (involving 386 patients) were included. The methodological quality of the included trials was evaluated as generally low. A total of 6 RCTs met all the inclusion criteria. 4 of them compared yoga plus conventional therapy with conventional therapy. 1 RCT described yoga combined with conventional therapy versus conventional therapy combined with breath awareness. 2 RCT tested the effect of yoga versus conventional therapy alone. 1 RCT described yoga compared to no treatment. Only one trial reported adverse events without details, the safety of yoga is still uncertain. Conclusions: There is some encouraging evidence of yoga for lowering SBP and DBP. However, due to low methodological quality of these identified trials, a definite conclusion about the efficacy and safety of yoga on EH cannot be drawn from this review. Therefore, further thorough investigation, large-scale, proper study designed, randomized trials of yoga for hypertension will be required to justify the effects reported here.

Being on the agenda of educational science for a long time now and gaining further importance during COVID-19 lockdowns, both advantages (e.g., reducing social anxiety, and a flexible schedule) and disadvantages (lack of social interactivity, and miscommunication) of distance education are highly debated in the related literature. Therefore, this study, through a qualitative method (i.e., a case study design and semi-structured interviews), aims to analyse the opinions and experiences of academics regarding distance education and its applications. The participants consist of 36 lecturers working at 16 different Turkish universities selected by the purposeful sampling method (i.e., typical case sampling). The results suggest that the participants still have doubts about online distance education, and they mention both ups (ease of connection, and cost-effectiveness) and downs (lack of self-motivation, socialization, and the sense of isolation) of it. Nonetheless, none of the academics thinks distance education will replace an in-person learning environment in the near future. Thus, this study presents a general illustration of distance education activities through the views of Turkish academics and gives recommendations for future digital/distance/online learning activities and functionalities.

Thus, system designers and developers consider the human characteristics at first when they think and design their system. For this consideration, user oriented learning system was introduced in education area. Especially, AEHS aims to provide learning contents that fits the individual learning style of users. That is, AEHS analyzes users' learning patterns and their learning process and according to the analyzed learning performance, the system identifies the most appropriate process for each user. But, in AEHS, it is difficult for users to choose learning contents fitted for their preference or learning ability. Also, system development process has many changes from traditional ways to new technology, ubiquitous and cloud computing. This change is to provide more convenient and efficient system process to developers and users. In this paper, we proposed AEHS considering user's characteristics in cloud computing environment. For this environment, we use the process as a service for learning system.

While such services are starting to emerge, current proprietary solutions are often expensive, covering only isolated parts of seniors' needs, and lack support for sharing information between services and between users. For developers, the challenge is that it is complex and time consuming to develop high quality, interoperable services, and new techniques are needed to simplify the development and reduce the development costs. This paper provides the complete view of the experiences gained in the MPOWER project with respect to using model-driven development (MDD) techniques for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) system development in the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) domain. Method: To address this challenge, the approach of the European research project MPOWER (2006-2009) was to investigate and record the user needs, define a set of reusable software services based on these needs, and then implement pilot systems using these services. Further, a model-driven toolchain covering key development phases was developed to support software developers through this process. Evaluations were conducted both on the technical artefacts (methodology and tools), and on end user experience from using the pilot systems in trial sites. Results: The outcome of the work on the user needs is a knowledge base recorded as a Unified Modeling Language (UML) model. This comprehensive model describes actors, use cases, and features derived from these. The model further includes the design of a set of software services, including full trace information back to the features and use cases motivating their design. Based on the model, the services were implemented for use in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) systems, and are publicly available as open source software. The services were successfully used in the realization of two pilot applications. There is therefore a direct and traceable link from the user needs of the elderly, through the service design knowledge base, to the service and pilot implementations. The evaluation of the SOA approach on the developers in the project revealed that SOA is useful with respect to job performance and quality. Furthermore, they think SOA is easy to use and support development of AAL applications. An important finding is that the developers clearly report that they intend to use SOA in the future, but not for all type of projects. With respect to using model-driven development in web services design and implementation, the developers reported that it was useful. However, it is important that the code generated from the models is correct if the full potential of MDD should be achieved. The pilots and their evaluation in the trial sites showed that the services of the platform are sufficient to create suitable systems for end users in the domain. Conclusions: A SOA platform with a set of reusable domain services is a suitable foundation for more rapid development and tailoring of assisted living systems covering reoccurring needs among elderly users. It is feasible to realize a tool-chain for model-driven development of SOA applications in the AAL domain, and such a tool-chain can be accepted and found useful by software developers.

Categorizing relative water use perception bias using household surveys and monthly water bills	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Relative water use perception bias; Social norms; Multi -level nested model; Water utility bills; Urban form	URBAN HEAT-ISLAND; UNITED-STATES; CONSUMPTION; BEHAVIOR; INFORMATION; DEMAND; MANAGEMENT; INTENTION; ATTITUDES; FEEDBACK	We introduce the concept of relative water use perception bias to highlight the role of human relationships, social cues, and the built environment in household water consumption. Although previous studies have explored actual water use, it is also important to understand how people perceive their relative behaviors because humans are social animals and act in relation to each other. We combine household survey responses and water utility bills in a large sample of households to quantify the degree of over-and under-estimation bias in perceived relative household water use. We then use multi-level nested regression models to investigate four categories of potential influence: sociodemographic characteristics, perceived social norms, neighborhood characteristics, and water bill information. Results show that most households tended to view themselves as 'better than average' water users when they actually used more water compared to neighbors. Respondents in high-income households and those who are more concerned about water shortages were more likely to underestimate their relative water use (using comparatively more than they thought). However, in more suburbanized neighborhood environments, households were more likely to overestimate their relative water use (using comparatively less than they thought). We call the inaccuracy in assessing water usage compared to their neighbors' relative water use perception bias. We propose that a better understanding of this bias can aid the design of policy initiatives like neighborhood planning, better water bill design, targeted messaging, and social signaling. By bringing a relational lens to bear on water conservation studies, understanding relative water use perception bias sheds new light on the complex drivers of household water consumption.

Besides, in video data, information such as object movement is included. Objects may move with time, and spatial features can change, which is incorporated in spatio-temporal relations. Many research studies have been carried out over time on information recognition by computers using low-level data in this connection. There is a semantic gap between low-level and high-level information in vocabulary representing human thinking. A substantial amount of research has been conducted on reducing the semantic gap, and it is focused on representation methods of logic. The goal of this study is to understand object movement and define spatio-temporal relations through mapping between vocabulary and the object movements. Ontology mapping is a method used to bridge the gap between low-level and high-level information. In this case, the spatio-temporal relation consists of temporal relations obedient to the passage of time, directional relations obedient to changes in object movement direction, changes in object size relations, topological relations obedient to changes in object movement position, and velocity relations using concept relations between topology models. In this paper, an ontology is used to define the inference rules using the proposed spatio-temporal relations and the use of Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) for probabilistic reasoning. Finally, the performed experiment and evaluation prove the verification recognition and understanding of object movements based on video data. This paper can be extended to retrieval and comparison between object movements, automatic annotation, and video summarization. The contributions of this paper include definition of the spatio-temporal relations of a region-based object, recognition of the semantic movements of moving objects, designing and constructing a spatio-temporal ontology, and Understanding the semantic movement of moving objects.

J	Yu, QY; Lin, HC; Chen, HH				Yu, Qi-Yue; Lin, Hong-Chi; Chen, Hsiao-Hwa			INTELLIGENT RADIO FOR NEXT GENERATION WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS: AN OVERVIEW	IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							CELLULAR NETWORKS	This article discusses various issues on intelligent radio (IR) from a perspective of intelligent UE and intelligent BS. Unlike a traditional UE, an intelligent UE can automatically access channel resources, cooperate with other UEs, and manage interferences. To implement such an intelligent UE, innovative techniques should be used, such as smart resource sensing and grant-free transmission. The core of IR lies in the development of thinking hardware, which can collect/process vital information of the environment and manage its resources optimally to support ultra-broadband communications. In particular, an integrated radar-communication unit is one of the most critical environment sensors in an intelligent UE, which helps it to acquire accurate location and mobility information of its neighbors for cooperation and interference avoidance. The traditional physical layer designs (such as beamforming and MIMO) should be revolutionized for the development of IR. MI. and other Al algorithms play an important role in both BS and UEs. The communication protocols should be re-designed as well. The IR can offer a very high spectrum efficiency and power efficiency and is one of the most important research topics for future-generation wireless communications.

Despite the significance of these issues, geomorphologists typically give scant regard to such deliberations. Geomorphology is not a linear, cause-and-effect science. Inherent complexities and uncertainties prompt perceptions of the process of interpretation in geomorphology as a frustrating form of witchcraft or wizardry - a dark art. Alternatively, acknowledging such challenges recognises the fun to be had in puzzle-solving encounters that apply abductive reasoning to make sense of physical landscapes, seeking to generate knowledge with a reliable evidence base. Carefully crafted approaches to interpretation relate generalised understandings derived from analysis of remotely sensed data with field observations/measurements and local knowledge to support appropriately contextualised place-based applications. In this paper we develop a cognitive approach (Describe-Explain-Predict) to interpret landscapes. Explanation builds upon meaningful description, thereby supporting reliable predictions, in a multiple lines of evidence approach. Interpretation transforms data into knowledge to provide evidence that supports a particular argument. Examples from fluvial geomorphology demonstrate the data-interpretation-knowledge sequence used to analyse river character, behaviour and evolution. Although Big Data and machine learning applications present enormous potential to transform geomorphology into a data-rich, increasingly predictive science, we outline inherent dangers in allowing prescriptive and synthetic tools to do the thinking, as interpreting local differences is an important element of geomorphic enquiry.

J	Kim, D; Kwon, YK; Cho, KH				Kim, Dongsan; Kwon, Yung-Keun; Cho, Kwang-Hyun			The biphasic behavior of incoherent feed-forward loops in biomolecular regulatory networks	BIOESSAYS			English	Article							MEDIATED CALCIUM-ENTRY; NITRIC-OXIDE; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; HUMAN PLATELETS; DEPENDENT MECHANISM; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; ARACHIDONIC-ACID; MESANGIAL CELLS; MOTIFS; RECEPTOR	An incoherent feed-forward loop (FFL) is one of the most-frequently observed motifs in biomolecular regulatory networks. It has been thought that the incoherent FFL is designed simply to induce a transient response shaped by a 'fast activation and delayed inhibition'. We find that the dynamics of various incoherent FFLs can be further classified into two types: time-dependent biphasic responses and dose-dependent biphasic responses. Why do the structurally identical incoherent FFLs play such different dynamical roles? Through computational studies, we show that the dynamics of the two types of incoherent FFLs are mutually exclusive. Following from further computational results and experimental observations, we hypothesize that incoherent FFLs have been optimally designed to achieve distinct biological function arising from different cellular contexts.

A quasi-experimental design was implemented with 84 junior high school students from two classes. One class with 44 students used combination of VPR strategy for learning, whereas the other class with 42 students used only physical robots (the PR strategy) to learn the same content materials. Results showed that no significant difference was found in the students' learning attitude, programming skills, and learning engagement between VPR and PR, while significant difference existed in engineering design ability and cognitive load, no matter in simple or complex learning sessions. Although the VPR strategy is not always better than the PR one, it has unique advantages on facilitating students' higher-order thinking in solving complex problem, as well as reducing their cognitive load. These findings highlight that VPR is more valuable to the engineering design tasks than PR, and indicate a potential direction in the future to integrate Virtual Reality/Augment Reality into robotics education.

J	Lam, KC; Anderson, BE; Bacon, CEW				Lam, Kenneth C.; Anderson, Barton E.; Bacon, Cailee E. Welch			The Critical Need for Advanced Training in Electronic Records Use: Implications for Clinical Practice, Education, and the Advancement of Athletic Training	JOURNAL OF ATHLETIC TRAINING			English	Article						health information technology; informatics; data; patient care documentation; core competencies	HEALTH INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; SPORTS-MEDICINE; PATIENT-CARE; TRAINERS; IMPLEMENTATION; DOCUMENTATION; STUDENTS; SYSTEMS	Context: The effective use of electronic records (ie, electronic health records or electronic medical records) is essential to professional initiatives and the overall advancement of the athletic training profession. However, evidence suggests that comprehensive patient care documentation and widespread use of electronic records are still limited in athletic training. The lack of formal training and education for clinicians and students is often cited as a primary barrier to electronic record use. Other health care disciplines have used academic electronic health record (AEHR) systems to address these barriers with promising results. Objectives: To identify common challenges associated with the effective use of electronic records in clinical practice, discuss how an AEHR system can address these challenges and encourage more effective use of electronic records, and describe strategies for deploying AEHRs in the athletic training profession. Description: The AEHR is an electronic records system specifically designed for educational use to support simulation learning among all types of learners (eg, practicing clinicians, students). Mimicking the form and function of an electronic health record, the AEHR offers various educational tasks, including patient care documentation projects, critical reviews of standardized patient cases, and assessments of patient care data for quality improvement efforts. Clinical and Research Advantages: Recent evidence suggests that the use of an AEHR can improve knowledge and enhance skills. Specifically, AEHR use has been associated with enhanced attitudes toward electronic health record tech-nology, increased informatics competencies, and improved documentation skills. Also, the use of an AEHR has been associated with improved critical thinking and decision-making skills. This tool appears to be valuable for health professions education, and athletic training stands to benefit from its use to better train and upskill clinicians and students alike for clinical practice. Although the implementation of an AEHR will require much time and large-scale coordinated efforts, it will be a worthy investment to address current challenges and advance the athletic training profession.

J	Edwards, D; Hawker, C; Carrier, J; Rees, C				Edwards, Deborah; Hawker, Clare; Carrier, Judith; Rees, Colin			A systematic review of the effectiveness of strategies and interventions to improve the transition from student to newly qualified nurse	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES			English	Review						Internship; Mentorship; New graduate nurses; Orientation; Preceptorship; Residency; Simulation; Transition	GRADUATE NURSES; RESIDENCY PROGRAM; RETENTION; OUTCOMES; RN; PERCEPTIONS; EXPERIENCES; COMPETENCE; IMPACT; MODEL	Background: The transition from student to newly qualified nurse can be stressful for many newly qualified nurses who feel inadequately prepared. A variety of support strategies to improve the transition process have been reported across the international literature but the effectiveness of such strategies is unknown. Objectives/aim: To determine the effectiveness of the main strategies used to support newly qualified nurses during the transition into the clinical workplace and, where identified, evaluate the impact of these on individual and organisational outcomes. Design: Systematic review. Data sources: A search of electronic databases to identify published studies (CINAHL, MEDLINE, British Nursing Index, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PsychLit, PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES, Web Of Science, EBM Reviews, BioMed, TRIP, ERIC, SCOPUS (January 2000-April 2011) was conducted. Relevant journals were hand-searched and reference lists from retrieved studies were reviewed to identify any further studies. The search was restricted to English language papers. The key words used were words that described new graduate nurses and support strategies (e.g. internship, residency, orientation programmes). Review methods: The inclusion criteria were quantitative studies that investigated the effectiveness of support strategies for newly qualified graduate nurses. Studies that involved students in their final year of graduate study were excluded (for example extern programmes). Extraction of data was undertaken independently by two reviewers. A further two reviewers assessed the methodological quality against agreed criteria. Results: A total of 8199 studies were identified from the database search and 30 met the inclusion criteria for the review. The evidence suggests that transition interventions/strategies do lead to improvements in confidence and competence, job satisfaction, critical thinking and reductions in stress and anxiety for the newly qualified nurse. Conclusions: This systematic review demonstrates the beneficial effects of transitional support strategies for newly qualified nurses from the perspective of the new nurse and their employer. The overall impact of support strategies appears positive, irrespective of the type of support provided. This may suggest that it is the organisations' focus on new graduate nurses that is important, rather than simply leaving them to acclimatise to their new role themselves. Future research should involve well designed randomised controlled trials with larger sample sizes, using more objective and reliable outcome measures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	BERRY, DA				BERRY, DA			A CASE FOR BAYESIANISM IN CLINICAL-TRIALS	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	CONF ON METHODOLOGICAL AND ETHICAL ISSUES IN CLINICAL TRIALS	JUN 27-28, 1991	LONDON, ENGLAND	LONDON SCH ECON CTR PHILOS NAT & SOCIAL SCI, ROYAL STAT SOC, MED SECT, MIND ASSOC, WELCOME TRUST, CIBA GEIGY, ECON & SOCIAL RES COUNCIL, ANAL COMM				This paper describes a Bayesian approach to the design and analysis of clinical trials, and compares it with the frequentist approach. Both approaches address learning under uncertainty. But they are different in a variety of ways. The Bayesian approach is more flexible. For example, accumulating data from a clinical trial can be used to update Bayesian measures, independent of the design of the trial. Frequentist measures are tied to the design, and interim analyses must be planned for frequentist measures to have meaning. Its flexibility makes the Bayesian approach ideal for analysing data from clinical trials. In carrying out a Bayesian analysis for inferring treatment effect, information from the clinical trial and other sources can be combined and used explicitly in drawing conclusions. Bayesians and frequentists address making decisions very differently. For example, when choosing or modifying the design of a clinical trial, Bayesians use all available information, including that which comes from the trial itself The ability to calculate predictive probabilities for future observations is a distinct advantage of the Bayesian approach to designing clinical trials and other decisions. An important difference between Bayesian and frequentist thinking is the role of randomization.

J	Stetzik, L; Deeter, A; Parker, J; Yukech, C				Stetzik, Lucas; Deeter, Anthony; Parker, Jamie; Yukech, Christine			Puzzle-based versus traditional lecture: comparing the effects of pedagogy on academic performance in an undergraduate human anatomy and physiology II lab	BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Puzzle; Lecture; Teaching; Pedagogy; Anatomy; Physiology; Performance; Concept	COMPUTER-SCIENCE	Background: A traditional lecture-based pedagogy conveys information and content while lacking sufficient development of critical thinking skills and problem solving. A puzzle-based pedagogy creates a broader contextual framework, and fosters critical thinking as well as logical reasoning skills that can then be used to improve a student's performance on content specific assessments. This paper describes a pedagogical comparison of traditional lecture-based teaching and puzzle-based teaching in a Human Anatomy and Physiology II Lab. Methods: Using a single subject/cross-over design half of the students from seven sections of the course were taught using one type of pedagogy for the first half of the semester, and then taught with a different pedagogy for the second half of the semester. The other half of the students were taught the same material but with the order of the pedagogies reversed. Students' performance on quizzes and exams specific to the course, and in-class assignments specific to this study were assessed for: learning outcomes (the ability to form the correct conclusion or recall specific information), and authentic academic performance as described by (Am J Educ 104: 280-312, 1996). Results: Our findings suggest a significant improvement in students' performance on standard course specific assessments using a puzzle-based pedagogy versus a traditional lecture-based teaching style. Quiz and test scores for students improved by 2.1 and 0.4 % respectively in the puzzle-based pedagogy, versus the traditional lecture-based teaching. Additionally, the assessments of authentic academic performance may only effectively measure a broader conceptual understanding in a limited set of contexts, and not in the context of a Human Anatomy and Physiology II Lab. Conclusion: In conclusion, a puzzle-based pedagogy, when compared to traditional lecture-based teaching, can effectively enhance the performance of students on standard course specific assessments, even when the assessments only test a limited conceptual understanding of the material.

Testing the rhetoric on new urbanism and safety from crime in Perth, Western Australia	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						New urbanism; Victimisation; Crime; Safety; Planning policy; Built environment	BUILT ENVIRONMENT; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; INNER-CITY; RESIDENTS PERCEPTIONS; ALCOHOL OUTLETS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; GREEN SPACE; DESIGN; FEAR; COMMUNITY	New urbanism advocates for the design of the compact, pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use developments thought to promote walking. New urbanist proponents also claim their developments incur other social and wellbeing benefits, including enhanced safety from crime; however there is limited empirical evidence supporting this. We tested the premise that new urbanism inhibits crime by examining the relationship between compliance with a planning policy based on new urbanism and: (1) residents' reports of victimisation; and (2) objective crime measures. RESIDE Participants (n = 603) who had lived in their new developments for 36 months completed a questionnaire that included items on their experiences of victimisation. Detailed measures quantifying the degree to which these developments (n = 36) complied with the policy requirements were generated in Geographic Information Systems. Logistic regression examined the associations between policy compliance and self-report victimisation, and negative binomial log-linear models examined area-level associations between compliance and objective crime. For each 10% increase in overall policy compliance, the odds of being a victim reduced by 40% (OR = 0.60, CI = 0.53-0.67, p = 0.000). Findings for the individual policy 'elements' were consistent with this: for each 10% increment in compliance with the community design, movement network, lot layout and public parkland elements, the odds of victimisation reduced by approximately 6% (p = 0.264), 51% (p = 0.001), 15% (p = 0.000) and 22% (p = 0.001) respectively. However, while policy compliance correlated with lower odds of self-report victimisation among residents, the associations between compliance and development-wide (objective) crime were positive but non-significant. The results indicate that planning policies based on new urbanism may indeed deliver other social and wellbeing benefits for residents, however they also hint that the design of an 'objectively' safe place may differ from the design of a 'subjectively' safe space.

The "gold standard" for OSA diagnosis at the moment is overnight polysomnography (PSG). Some researchers think portable monitors (PMs) are promising methods for diagnosing OSA, which make children more comfortable and lower costs. Compared with PSG, our comprehensively evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of PMs for diagnosing OSA in pediatrics.Research questionThis study aims to determine whether PMs can replace PSG in pediatric OSA diagnosis.Study design and methodsThe PubMed, Embase, Medline databases Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched systematically for studies published up to December 2022, evaluating the ability of PMs to diagnose OSA in children. For estimating the pooled sensitivity and specificity of the PMs in the included studies, we used a random-effects bivariate model. Studies included in this meta-analysis were evaluated systematically according to QUADAS-2 guidelines for assessing diagnostic accuracy studies. Two independent investigators conducted each stage of the review independently.ResultsA total of 396 abstracts and 31 full-text articles were screened, and 41 full-text articles were chosen for final review. There were 707 pediatric patients enrolled in these twelve studies, and 9 PMs were evaluated. There was a wide range of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity among PM systems as compared to AHI measured by PSG. The pooled sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing pediatric OSA were, respectively, 0.91 [0.86, 0.94] and 0.76 [0.58, 0.88] for PMs. According to the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve, the AUC of PMs in diagnosing OSA in pediatric population was 0.93 [0.90, 0.95].InterpretationPMs were more sensitive but slightly less specific for pediatric OSA. The combination of PMs and questionnaires appeared to be a reliable tool for the diagnosis of pediatric OSA. This test may be used for screening subjects or populations at high risk of OSA when there is a high demand for PSG, but the quantity is limited. No clinical trial was involved in the current study.

City identity is the resultant of all forces for changing the city to a cohesive physical-social arena and to strengthen cultural-social prestige and structural phenomenology of urban identity using the effects of these arenas. What creates the urban identity is the coordination between architectural and urban spaces with the performance and the content of physical-social phenomena in a city. Cultural performance spaces are among the most important of these spaces which have the important and valuable role in the hierarchy of urban identity. This study investigates the importance and clear position of the spaces with the cultural using for strengthening and promoting the urban identity. This research in regard to implementation process is qualitative, descriptive and then analytical. The investigation and the concepts are based on library and documentation methods. The results indicate that cultural spaces can be considered as one of physical-social phenomena of a city. Despite of different problems in the design, cultural spaces should be built in coordination with the framework determined in the principles of urban identity. Hence in creating these spaces, a suitable design of the city identity can be imaged by benefiting from past experiences and new thinking. Whatever systematic principles of urban and architectural design have more effective communication with urban identity structure, the stability of urban identity will be provided.

J	Cheng, MY; Yang, SC				Cheng, MY; Yang, SC			GIS-base cost estimate integrating with material layout planning	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE			English	Article								This study is focused on developing an automated site layout system for construction materials. The system, MaterialPlan, including a geographic information system (GIS) based cost estimates system integrated with material layout planning, is a new tool to assist managers in identifying suitable areas to locate construction materials. As tabulation of all project quantities is calculated using GIS, linkages are established between the graphical features of detailed design and the related estimating quantities. Based on information regarding quantities and locations of the materials required in the project, this study identifies the suitable site to store the materials. Using the concept of "searching by elimination," the system develops a heuristic approach, modeling the process of human decision making to generate potential sites for placing the materials. An objective function called the proximity index is developed to determine the optimal site. In conclusion, MaterialPlan demonstrates that GIS is a promising tool for solving construction layout problems and thus opens up a new way of thinking for the management of spatial information in construction planning and design.

J	Shepherd, L; Lovell, B				Shepherd, Lee; Lovell, Brian			The role of psychosocial factors in predicting the formalized human milk donation to nonprofit milk banks	JOURNAL OF APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							PLANNED BEHAVIOR; EXTENDED THEORY; ANTICIPATED REGRET; SELF-EFFICACY; PERCEIVED CONTROL; DONOR; BLOOD; WILLINGNESS; PEER; METAANALYSIS	Human milk donation is important for improving the development of preterm infants. However, despite the importance of donating the human milk, relatively little research has tested which factors predict this form of donation. This study assessed the association between the psychosocial factors and formalized milk donation to a nonprofit milk bank. This study used a cross-sectional design. Breastfeeding mothers (N = 556) completed measures assessing altruism, pride, instrumental and affective attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, self-efficacy, anxiety, and intention to donate human milk to a nonprofit milk bank. We also assessed whether participants requested additional information about donating the human milk. Instrumental and affective attitude, subjective norm, and self-efficacy were positively associated with intention to donate milk. Self-efficacy and intention were also uniquely associated with requesting the additional information. The intention to engage in the formalized milk donation to a nonprofit milk bank appears to be more likely if women view this action as beneficial, believe significant others support the action and think they have the ability to undertake this action. Women who think they have the ability to undertake this action and are willing to donate are more likely to request additional information. These findings might inform future experimental research and campaigns on the human milk donation.

Until now complex folded molecules are the product either of evolution or of an elaborate process of design and synthesis. We now show that molecules that fold in a well-defined architecture of substantial complexity can emerge autonomously and selectively from a simple precursor. Specifically, we have identified a self-synthesizing macrocyclic foldamer with a complex and unprecedented secondary and tertiary structure that constructs itself highly selectively from 15 identical peptide-nucleobase subunits, using a dynamic combinatorial chemistry approach. Folding of the structure drives its synthesis in 95% yield from a mixture of interconverting molecules of different ring sizes in a one-step process. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography and NMR reveal a folding pattern based on an intricate network of noncovalent interactions involving residues spaced apart widely in the linear sequence. These results establish dynamic combinatorial chemistry as a powerful approach to developing synthetic molecules with folding motifs of a complexity that goes well beyond that accessible with current design approaches. The fact that such molecules can form autonomously implies that they may have played a role in the origin of life at earlier stages than previously thought possible.

MOTIVATION; TEACHERS; STUDENTS; AUTONOMY; ENGAGEMENT	Education plays a key role in the development of human civilisation. Learning and teaching methods are still evolving and undergoing numerous changes as a result of scientific knowledge and revolutionary ideas of stakeholders in the education system, and the development of advanced technologies. We are all familiar with traditional ways of learning wherein educational process is conducted in such a way that the focus is primarily on content. Jan Amos Komensky, the alpha and omega of education science, laid out the class-subject-lesson traditional education system and designed, as early as the 17th century, the school as an institution capable of meeting the mass educational demands of the time. Because these traditional methods use repetition and memorisation of information as the principal means of acquiring knowledge, students are unable to develop their critical thinking, problem-solving and decision-making skills. In the 21st century, teaching should be focused on the effective cooperation between teachers and students who are actively participating in the teaching process, because such an approach ensures the training of innovative individuals who go on to become qualified professionals and responsible citizens, thus creating a more affluent and safer society in general. This paper provides an overview of the important characteristics of modern schools, as well as some modern teaching strategies.

Because the neocortex is widely thought to be involved in long-term information storage, this resistance raises questions about the validity of LTP as a memory model. Recently, we have shown that the neocortex of freely moving rats reliably supports LTP, provided that the stimulation is spaced and repeated over days. The following experiments were designed to evaluate the neuromodulatory role played by cholinergic systems in the induction of LTP in this preparation. Chronically implanted rats received either low- or high-intensity LTP-inducing tetani in combination with the administration of either a cholinergic agonist or antagonist injected systemically. potentiation was evidenced as amplitude changes in both early and late components of the evoked field potential, the former including: population spikes. The cholinergic agonist facilitated LTP induction in the late Component of both high- and low-intensity groups. The cholinergic antagonist blocked Lm induction in the early component of the high intensity group. The possibility that there are component-specific modulatory effects of cholinergic agents on the induction of neocortical LTP is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Levin, M				Levin, Michael			Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere: An Experimentally-Grounded Framework for Understanding Diverse Bodies and Minds	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						regeneration; basal cognition; bioelectricity; gap junctions; synthetic morphology; bioengineering	DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER; ION CHANNELS; NERVOUS SYSTEMS; STEM-CELLS; LONG-TERM; EVOLUTIONARY TRANSITIONS; VERTEBRATE REGENERATION; DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY; INFORMATION-SEEKING; PERSONAL IDENTITY	Synthetic biology and bioengineering provide the opportunity to create novel embodied cognitive systems (otherwise known as minds) in a very wide variety of chimeric architectures combining evolved and designed material and software. These advances are disrupting familiar concepts in the philosophy of mind, and require new ways of thinking about and comparing truly diverse intelligences, whose composition and origin are not like any of the available natural model species. In this Perspective, I introduce TAME-Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere-a framework for understanding and manipulating cognition in unconventional substrates. TAME formalizes a non-binary (continuous), empirically-based approach to strongly embodied agency. TAME provides a natural way to think about animal sentience as an instance of collective intelligence of cell groups, arising from dynamics that manifest in similar ways in numerous other substrates. When applied to regenerating/developmental systems, TAME suggests a perspective on morphogenesis as an example of basal cognition. The deep symmetry between problem-solving in anatomical, physiological, transcriptional, and 3D (traditional behavioral) spaces drives specific hypotheses by which cognitive capacities can increase during evolution. An important medium exploited by evolution for joining active subunits into greater agents is developmental bioelectricity, implemented by pre-neural use of ion channels and gap junctions to scale up cell-level feedback loops into anatomical homeostasis. This architecture of multi-scale competency of biological systems has important implications for plasticity of bodies and minds, greatly potentiating evolvability. Considering classical and recent data from the perspectives of computational science, evolutionary biology, and basal cognition, reveals a rich research program with many implications for cognitive science, evolutionary biology, regenerative medicine, and artificial intelligence.

In an era where much is said about the 'open society' and open innovation, looking at the interplay between involvement, technology and social good becomes of particular importance and interest. Having employed an action research approach, we examine how actors have enacted an open technology at the local governance level in a town in Zambia. Our interest is in how the different groups of local people have co-created the technology through multiple negotiations, organizational forms and institutional arrangements. Being theoretically inspired by the technology enactment framework', we propose an approach for framing the design of participatory technology projects at the local governance level, with implications for both theory and practice.

In the current information era, the unprecedented reach and diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICT) to the remotest countries of the world make it a catalyst to achieve the desired target of human development. But ICT cannot be highly overrated, while the world acknowledges the benefits of incorporating ICT to solve societal issues, the world reports also indicate that nearly 70% of ICT designed projects for development are mere failures. The reason can be attributed to the societal norms and cultural aspects of the community toward the usage of technology. This study builds on the thought that the sustained usage of ICT is highly dependent on the various factors and facets of the society. Using national culture as a societal facet, the study demonstrates the necessity of congruence between ICT usage and national culture values to attain the desired human development. The results indicate that national culture dimensions of low-power distance, collectivism, femininity, short-term orientation, and restraint with ICT have significant influence on human development index. The study demonstrates the variations in using ICT for human development depending on cultures in different regions of the world. The study has implications for policymakers at national and international levels regarding treatment of ICT for human development.

J	Chen, YY; Chen, GG				Chen, Yunyue; Chen, Guanggui			Optimization of the Intelligent Asset Management System Based on WSN and RFID Technology	JOURNAL OF SENSORS			English	Article							MAINTENANCE; INTERNET; DESIGN	With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, especially the promotion of perception layer radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and wireless sensor network (WSN), a new way of thinking is provided for asset management. Applying both to the management technology of assets is an effective way to achieve intelligent asset management. This paper proposes an intelligent network applied to an asset management system based on WSN and RFID technologies. The whole intelligent asset management is divided into four layers according to the functional structure. From the top layer downward, the layers are the management and dispatch center, communication network, intelligent gateway, and data collection layer in order. Meanwhile, the functions and hardware composition of each layer are described. The data acquisition butcher is the sensing terminal of the whole intelligent asset management network. Smart nodes are its key devices to collect RFID data and sensing data to realize the intelligent sensing capability of the assets. The paper uses the MSP430 control chip, MFRC522 RF read/write chip, CC2425 wireless communication chip, temperature sensor, data memory, and voltage regulator chip to design the smart nodes in the system and details the working principle of the smart nodes and the networking process of the system. The newly designed intelligent asset management network can be deployed independently in asset management or can be integrated into the technical design of existing asset management systems. The management scheduling also collects and manages the RFID and sensing information of the area through the data collection layer, which improves the intelligent construction of the assets.

Medial zones: Formulation and applications	COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN			English	Article						Medial zones; Medial axis; Skeletons; Distance functions; R-functions	SHAPE; OPTIMIZATION; CONSTRUCTION; AXIS	The popularity of medial axis in shape modeling and analysis comes from several of its well known fundamental properties. For example, medial axis captures the connectivity of the domain, has a lower dimension than the space itself, and is closely related to the distance function constructed over the same domain. We propose the new concept of a medial zone of an n-dimensional semi-analytic domain Omega that subsumes the medial axis MA(Omega) of the same domain as a special case, and can be thought of as a 'thick' skeleton having the same dimension as that of Omega. We show that by transforming the exact, non-differentiable, distance function of domain Omega into approximate but differentiable distance functions, and by controlling the geodesic distance to the crests of the approximate distance functions of domain Omega, one obtains families of medial zones of Omega that are homeomorphic to the domain and are supersets of MA(Omega). We present a set of natural properties for the medial zones MZ(Omega) of Omega and discuss practical approaches to compute both medial axes and medial zones for 3-dimensional semi-analytic sets with rigid or evolving boundaries. Due to the fact that the medial zones fuse some of the critical geometric and topological properties of both the domain itself and of its medial axis, re-formulating problems in terms of medial zones affords the 'best of both worlds' in applications such as geometric reasoning, robotic and autonomous navigation, and design automation.

The Impact of Adding a Fourth Item to the Traditional 3-Item Remote Associates Test	CREATIVITY RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access							SEMANTIC SEARCH; NEURAL ACTIVITY; VERBAL PROBLEMS; WORKING-MEMORY; CREATIVITY; CONVERGENT; DIVERGENT; INTELLIGENCE; ACTIVATION; THINKING	The compound Remote Associates Test (RAT) is a classic measure of creativity. Participants are shown three cue words (sore-shoulder-sweat) and asked to generate a word that connects them (cold). Theoretical views of RAT performance differ in the degree to which they conceptualize performance as depending on automatic spreading activation across semantic networks, strategic generation of bi-associations, and other analytical processes (e.g. executive processes that support fluid intelligence). We tested these views by adding a fourth cue word to determine whether it impaired RAT accuracy (e.g. generation of bi-associations), impaired response times (analytic processes), or improved RAT accuracy without changing response times (e.g. spreading activation). Across four experiments, 551 adults completed 3- and 4-item RAT trials that were matched on linguistic and semantic metrics. Across experiments, adding the fourth word improved accuracy by 27.91%. This performance gain occurred with either modest or no changes to response times or ratings of insight/strategy use. Interestingly, the fourth word predominantly benefited accuracy and response times on difficult trials; on easy trials, the fourth word impaired or did not change performance. The findings suggest that both automatic and strategic/analytical processes contribute to successful RAT performance, with relative dependence on these processes dynamically adapting to the demands of the individual trial. Plain Language SummaryUnderstanding creative achievements in real-world settings requires understanding the cognitive processes that contribute to creativity. One way to do this involves examining performance on standardized creativity instruments across purposefully created conditions. We conducted four experiments in which we modified the semantic information in the Remote Associates Test (RAT), which is one of the more commonly used instruments to assess creativity. We found that as the amount of semantic information provided to participants increased, so too did performance on the RAT. There was, however, a surprising exception: on relatively easy trials, providing more semantic information sometimes hurt performance. These patterns replicated four times using different stimuli sets, designs, and participant samples. Collectively, the findings indicate that multiple cognitive processes are engaged to support creative thinking, with the relative dependence on a given process depending on the difficulty of the problem being solved. Targeting the dynamic nature of automatic and strategic/analytical thinking processes may improve the efficacy of interventions aimed at fostering creative achievements in real-world settings.

Methods Theory-based, evidence-based and person-based approaches to intervention development were used. In phase I, a qualitative systematic review and qualitative interviews developed an in-depth understanding of the needs and challenges of young people with eczema. Guiding principles highlighted key intervention design objectives and features to address the needs of this target group to maximise user engagement. Behavioural analysis and logic modelling developed ECO's hypothesised programme theory. In phase II, qualitative think-aloud interviews were carried out with 28 young people with eczema and the intervention was optimised based on their feedback. Results The final intervention aimed to reduce eczema severity by supporting treatment use (emollients, topical corticosteroids/topical calcineurin inhibitors), management of irritants/triggers, emotional management and reducing scratching. Generally, young people expressed positive views of intervention content and design in think-aloud interviews. Quotes and stories from other young people with eczema and ECO's focus on living with eczema (not just topical treatments) were valuable for normalising eczema. Young people believed ECO addressed knowledge gaps they had from childhood and the safety information about topical corticosteroids was reassuring. Negative feedback was used to modify ECO. Conclusions A prototype of the ECO intervention was developed using rigorous and complementary intervention development approaches. Subsequent think-aloud interviews helped optimise the intervention, demonstrated ECO is likely to be acceptable to this target group, and provided support for our guiding principles including key design objectives and features to consider when developing interventions for this population. A randomised controlled trial and process evaluation of the intervention is underway to assess effectiveness and explore user engagement with the intervention's behavioural goals.

The approach taken is to develop a set of use cases, which would be capable of providing information support to a pre-defined organisational process. The nature of the thinking. which is necessary to derive the use cases, is outlined using the pre-defined process as a case study. The grouping of transactions and state changes into Use Cases is shown to require design choices, which may vary between particular organisational contexts. Conclusions are drawn about the direction of further investigation of links between process modelling and UML. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dopamine D2 agonist affects visuospatial working memory distractor interference depending on individual differences in baseline working memory span	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Agonist; Basal ganglia; Cabergoline; Capacity; Dopamine; D2; Individual differences; Prefrontal cortex; Striatum; Visuospatial working memory; Working memory	GENERAL FLUID INTELLIGENCE; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; STRIATAL DOPAMINE; COMPUTATIONAL MODELS; ATTENTIONAL BLINK; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BINDING PROFILES; D-2 RECEPTORS	The interplay of dopaminergic striatal D1-D2 circuits is thought to support working memory (WM) by selectively filtering information that is to be remembered versus information to be ignored. To test this theory, we conducted an experiment in which healthy participants performed a visuospatial working memory (VSWM) task after ingesting the D2-receptor agonist cabergoline (or placebo), in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover design. Results showed greater interference from distractors under cabergoline, particularly for individuals with higher baseline dopamine (indicated by WM span). These findings support computational theories of striatal D1-D2 function during WM encoding and distractor-filtering, and provide new evidence for interactive cortico-striatal systems that support VSWM capacity and their dependence on WM span.

Toward a Conceptual Model of Affective Predictions in Palliative Care	JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Palliative care; advance care plans; affective predictions; affective forecasting; empathy gap	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; ANTICIPATORY GRIEF; ADVANCE DIRECTIVES; DIGNITY THERAPY; EMPATHY GAP; CANCER; END; DECISION; FAMILY; HEALTH	Context. Being diagnosed with cancer often forces patients and families to make difficult medical decisions. How patients think they and others will feel in the future, termed affective predictions, may influence these decisions. These affective predictions are often biased, which may contribute to suboptimal care outcomes by influencing decisions related to palliative care and advance care planning. Objectives. This study aimed to translate perspectives from the decision sciences to inform future research about when and how affective predictions may influence decisions about palliative care and advance care planning. Methods. A systematic search of two databases to evaluate the extent to which affective predictions have been examined in the palliative care and advance care planning context yielded 35 relevant articles. Over half utilized qualitative methodologies (n = 21). Most studies were conducted in the U.S. (n = 12), Canada (n = 7), or European countries (n = 10). Study contexts included end of life (n = 10), early treatment decisions (n = 10), pain and symptom management (n = 7), and patient-provider communication (n = 6). The affective processes of patients (n = 20), caregivers (n = 16), and/or providers (n = 12) were examined. Results. Three features of the palliative care and advance care planning context may contribute to biased affective predictions: 1) early treatment decisions are made under heightened emotional states and with insufficient information; 2) palliative care decisions influence life domains beyond physical health; and 3) palliative care decisions involve multiple people. Conclusion. Biases in affective predictions may serve as a barrier to optimal palliative care delivery. Predictions are complicated by intense emotions, inadequate prognostic information, involvement of many individuals, and cancer's effect on nonehealth life domains. Applying decision science frameworks may generate insights about affective predictions that can be harnessed to solve challenges associated with optimal delivery of palliative care.

Understanding the sensemaking process allows building effective visual analytics tools to make sense of large and complex datasets. Currently, it is often a manual and time-consuming undertaking to comprehend this: researchers collect observation data, transcribe screen capture videos and think-aloud recordings, identify recurring patterns, and eventually abstract the sensemaking process into a general model. In this paper, we propose a general approach to facilitate such a qualitative analysis process, and introduce a prototype, SensePath, to demonstrate the application of this approach with a focus on browser-based online sensemaking. The approach is based on a study of a number of qualitative research sessions including observations of users performing sensemaking tasks and post hoc analyses to uncover their sensemaking processes. Based on the study results and a follow-up participatory design session with HCI researchers, we decided to focus on the transcription and coding stages of thematic analysis. SensePath automatically captures user's sensemaking actions, i.e., analytic provenance, and provides multi-linked views to support their further analysis. A number of other requirements elicited from the design session are also implemented in SensePath, such as easy integration with existing qualitative analysis workflow and non-intrusive for participants. The tool was used by an experienced HCI researcher to analyze two sensemaking sessions. The researcher found the tool intuitive and considerably reduced analysis time, allowing better understanding of the sensemaking process.	[Nguyen, Phong H.; Xu, Kai; Wheat, Ashley; Wong, B. L.

Effect of Urinary Macromolecules on L-Cystine Crystal Growth and Crystal Surface Adhesion	CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN			English	Article							CALCIUM-OXALATE MONOHYDRATE; ATOMIC-FORCE MICROSCOPY; HEXAGONAL L-CYSTINE; ACID-RICH PEPTIDES; KIDNEY-STONES; ANTIFREEZE PROTEIN; SINGLE-CRYSTALS; MOLECULAR-LEVEL; ANNEALING TIME; L-TYROSINE	L-Cystine is the primary crystalline component of L-cystine kidney stones, which are a consequence of cystinuria, a genetic disorder that results from mutation in the SLC3A1 or the SLC7A9 gene. Urinary macromolecules present in the cellular matrix are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of kidney stones affecting crystal nucleation, growth, crystal-crystal aggregation, and adhesion to epithelial cells. The effect of six prevalent urinary constituents osteopontin, Tamm Horsfall protein, albumin, apotransferrin, chondroitin sulfate, and lysozyme on crystallization kinetics and adhesion events on the L-cystine (0001) surface was investigated with real-time in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). These additives did not significantly change crystal morphology and crystallization yield, although slight reductions in step velocities were observed at nanogram per milliliter and microgram per milliliter concentrations. Chemical force microscopy performed with AFM tips decorated with terminal carboxylate, amino, and cysteine moieties revealed that macromolecular additives reduce the binding affinity of the {0001} face of L-cystine toward these groups. Collectively, these observations suggest that these macromolecules may actually mitigate L-cystine crystal growth and aggregation into stones.

This paper proposes new road and building symbols in mapping Brazilian urban areas, aiming to increase the effectiveness of map-reading tasks (MRTs) in a multi-scale context. For this purpose, colour theory and semiotics were applied to develop new symbols and a remote test through an adapted think-aloud protocol. The results showed that users performed better with the proposed symbols than the previous ones.

However, integrated qualitative studies in such trials are needed to enable a broader evaluation of patient experiences in the trial, with important ethical and practical implications for the design and conduct of similar trials and treatment regimes in the future. Methods: Ten participants were recruited from the control and intervention arms of FRAGMATIC: a non-placebo trial for patients with advanced lung cancer. Participants were interviewed at up to three time points during their time in the trial. Interviews were analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Results: Patients were motivated to join the trial out of hope of medical benefit and altruism. Understanding of randomisation was mixed and in some cases poor, as was appreciation of trial purpose and equipoise. The trial was acceptable to and evaluated positively by most participants; participants receiving the intervention focused on the potential treatment benefits they hoped they would receive, whilst participants in the control arm found alternative reasons, such as altruism, personal fulfilment and positive attention, to commit to and perceive benefits from the trial. However, whilst experiences were generally very positive, poor understanding, limited engagement with trial information and focus on treatment benefits amongst some participants give cause for concern. Conclusions: By exploring longitudinally the psychological, emotional and cognitive domains of trial participation, we consider potential harms and benefits of participation in non-placebo trials amongst patients with advanced lung cancer and identify several implications for future research with and care for patients with advanced cancer.

The Scientific Method as a Scaffold to Enhance Communication Skills in Chemistry	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Communication/Writing; Undergraduate Research; Curriculum; First-Year Undergraduate/General Audience; Second-Year Undergraduate; Upper-Division Undergraduate	CHEMICAL INFORMATION LITERACY; CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS; ORGANIC-CHEMISTRY; UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH; PROXIMAL DEVELOPMENT; COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH; SCIENCE COMMUNICATION; CONTEMPORARY-ISSUES; GRADUATE-EDUCATION; WRITING SKILLS	Scientific success in the field of chemistry depends upon the mastery of a wide range of soft skills, most notably scientific writing and speaking. However, training for scientific communication is typically limited at the undergraduate level, where students struggle to express themselves in a dear and logical manner. The underlying issue is deeper than basic technical skills; rather, it is a problem of students' unawareness of a fundamental and strategic framework for writing and speaking with a purpose. The methodology has been implemented for individual mentorship and in our regional summer research program to deliver a blueprint of thought and reasoning that endows students with the confidence and skills to become more effective communicators. Our didactic process intertwines undergraduate research with the scientific method and is partitioned into six steps, referred to as "phases", to allow for focused and deep thinking on the essential components of the scientific method. The phases are designed to challenge the student in their zone of proximal development so they learn to extract and ultimately comprehend the elements of the scientific method through focused written and oral assignments. Students then compile their newly acquired knowledge to create a compelling and logical story, using their persuasive written and oral presentations to complete a research proposal, final report, and formal 20 min presentation. We find that such an approach delivers the necessary guidance to promote the logical framework that improves writing and speaking skills. Over the past decade, we have witnessed both qualitative and quantitative gains in the students' confidence in their abilities and skills (developed by this process), preparing them for future careers as young scientists.

The process emphasizes teachers' prolonged engagement with peers and researchers in design teams. Supported by technological pedagogical content knowledge rubrics and technological pedagogical content knowledge design heuristics, the process enabled teachers to assess their current ICT lessons, set design goals, redesign, implement, and evaluate student learning outcomes, as well as reflect on their pedagogical practices. A year-long implementation study conducted with 37 teachers from a Singapore primary school who were organized into seven lesson design teams found that the process had positive effects on teachers' confidence for technological pedagogical content knowledge for 21st century learning and lesson design practices. Five of the seven design teams were able to make pedagogical changes toward 21st century learning, and six of the teams realized improvement in student learning outcomes. The implications for teacher ICT professional development are discussed.

To collect quantitative data, a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest with a control group design was employed, and to collect qualitative data, a case study design was used. The study was designed around the lesson topic "geometric objects and measuring volume," and 88 sixth grade students participated. While the students in the experimental group studied the lesson topic using augmented reality and real objects, the students in the control group used only real objects. The results indicate that though a significant increase was observed in the spatial ability of both groups, no significant difference was found between the post-test spatial ability mean scores of the experimental and control groups. In addition to the spatial ability results, the students' academic achievement scores in the experimental group significantly increased, but the small increase in the control group students' scores was not significant. No significant difference was found between the post-test academic achievement scores of the experimental and control groups. In addition to the quantitative data, the qualitative data gathered from the students and the teacher yielded valuable information that may assist researchers who attempt to integrate augmented reality in education.

The Family Gene Toolkit encourages family communication of genetic testing results and cascade genetic testing among at-risk relatives. Feedback from 68 women with genetic changes and 31 clinicians informed the culturally sensitive adaptation of the content. The Information Technology team developed the web application that will host the intervention. Finally, a new sample of 18 women from families with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer reviewed and evaluated the adapted content and the functions of the web application. Findings support that overall, the adapted Family Gene Toolkit is well-designed, has useful information for these families, and provides interactive content and illustrative stories. The research team will test if it can increase rates of cascade testing among at-risk relatives in a subsequent randomized trial. The study adapted the Family Gene Toolkit and developed a customized web application for Swiss and Korean families harboring BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants to support family communication of genetic testing results and promote cascade genetic testing among at-risk relatives. In the first step, narrative data from 68 women with BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variants and clinician feedback informed a culturally sensitive adaptation of the content consistent with current risk management guidelines. In the second step, the Information Technology team developed the functions and the interface of the web application that will host the intervention. In the third step, a new sample of 18 women from families harboring BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variants tested the acceptability and usability of the intervention using "think-aloud" interviews and a questionnaire. Participants expressed high levels of satisfaction with the intervention. They provided positive feedback for the information regarding active coping, strategies to enhance family communication, interactive elements, and illustrative stories. They reported that the information was useful and the web application was easy to navigate. Findings suggest that the Family Gene Toolkit is well-designed and can increase rates of cascade testing among at-risk relatives. Its efficacy will be tested in a subsequent randomized trial.

There is little evidence on mobile health app facilitated remote monitoring in India. We conducted a pilot usability and feasibility assessment of a smartphone-based application (Suhriday) to remotely monitor patients with CHF. Methods We used a mixed-methods design. Usability testing consisted of the think-aloud approach followed by semistructured in-depth interviews (SSIs) and a satisfaction questionnaire. Feasibility testing was done using acceptability and user satisfaction questionnaires in addition to SSIs. We trained five purposively sampled patients with CHF (based on health literacy and gender) and their caregivers (n=10) in self-care monitoring and app use. Usability was assessed using metrics such as task completion, time required for task completion and user satisfaction using Brooke's System Usability Scale (SUS). Content analysis of the transcripts with deductive coding was performed for both usability and feasibility interviews. The number and types of medical alerts transmitted through the app were captured and escalated to the treating team. Results Critical tasks involving (1) opening the app and identifying task list, (2) reporting blood pressure, weight, heart rate and fluid intake and (3) reporting symptoms were completed within 60 s by four patients. Median (IQR) SUS score was 85 (75-92.5) indicating high level of usability. There were 62 alerts from four patients over 4 weeks, with 36 (58.1%) excess fluid intake alerts and 16 (25.8%) blood pressure variations being the most frequent. One participant had challenges using the app and was monitored through active phone calls. Conclusion Overall usability and satisfaction with Suhriday were good and we were able to remotely manage patients. However, patients with limited health literacy and those facing technological challenges required active structured telephone support.

A study on respondents' cognitive processing	EDUCATIONAL ASSESSMENT EVALUATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY			English	Article						School self-evaluation; Cognitive processing; Instruments; Survey design; Validity	STRATEGIES; INTERVIEWS; QUESTIONS; MODELS	School self-evaluation (SSE), as an important leverage for quality assurance, often relies on surveys among staff members to collect information on the schools' functioning. The extent to which respondents cognitively process items as developers intended them determines the cognitive validity of SSE results. However, it is unclear what problems occur in respondents' cognitive processes which lead to cognitively invalid SSE results and how respondents' positions in the school affects these cognitive processes. This study draws on cognitive interviews conducted with 20 teachers and principals to understand their thinking process while answering an SSE survey. Cognitively invalid results were analysed using a content analysis to identify problems in respondents' cognitive processes. Findings showed that respondents experience semantic and syntactical issues when interpreting items. While elaborating, problems were found regarding items' topic and focus, particularly concerning whom to make a statement about. Issues also emerged in the response stage, especially that the 'don't know' option was not used as intended. Respondents' positions influence their understanding about whom a statement is required and how self-evident some items are to them. These problems should be taken into account by developers of SSE surveys and other instruments that intend to measure organisational characteristics.

Infomax Control of Eye Movements	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTONOMOUS MENTAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Eye movement; face detection; infomax control; object detection; policy gradient; visual search	ATTENTION; DESIGN; MODEL	Recently, infomax methods of optimal control have begun to reshape how we think about active information gathering. We show how such methods can be used to formulate the problem of choosing where to look. We show how an optimal eye movement controller can be learned from subjective experiences of information gathering, and we explore in simulation properties of the optimal controller. This controller outperforms other eye movement strategies proposed in the literature. The learned eye movement strategies are tailored to the specific visual system of the learner-we show that agents with different kinds of eyes should follow different eye movement strategies. Then we use these insights to build an autonomous computer program that follows this approach and learns to search for faces in images faster than current state-of-the-art techniques. The context of these results is search in static scenes, but the approach extends easily, and gives further efficiency gains, to dynamic tracking tasks. A limitation of infomax methods is that they require probabilistic models of uncertainty of the sensory system, the motor system, and the external world. In the final section of this paper, we propose future avenues of research by which autonomous physical agents may use developmental experience to subjectively characterize the uncertainties they face.

J	Dreyer, J; van der Walt, K				Dreyer, Johan; van der Walt, Kobus			The origin of life: "In the beginning was the Word"	TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE			English	Article						origin of life; normative materialism; Creationism; Panspermia; Abiogenesis; information in DNA; Anthropocentric3 principle; data	GENE-EXPRESSION; RANDOMNESS; PRINCIPLES	origin of life: beginning Many scientists and researchers agree that biological life on earth most likely arose naturally, but they cannot account for the exact method by which life arose. Numerous experiments and observations have provided evidence that the basic building blocks of life (amino acids) can form spontaneously under the conditions thought to be those present on ancient earth. The recent discovery of Extremophiles (organisms that thrive in extreme conditions such as high temperature and pressure) gave further impetus to the belief that it is possible for unguided, random mechanisms to produce life. However, contrary to scientists who present contemporary scientific evidence as proof of life having a natural origin, there is a growing number of authoritative scholars who claim that the a priori conditions for life to exist at all, as well as its complexity, are indicative of carefully planned, guided mechanisms. Contrary to a materialistic/atheistic view, these researchers advocate a willingness to follow contemporary data to its most likely, logical conclusion. This conclusion involves the continuous involvement of a Creator right from the moment of creation, to the present. The group of theories that centre around a belief that life was created by a supernatural force or deity is known as Creationism. It is based on religious beliefs that determine the way in which natural scientific data is interpreted. Creationists argue that the complexity of living organisms, as well as the existence of consciousness, cannot be explained by random, unguided processes and must have been designed by a higher power. One of the arguments for a supernatural origin of life, is the Anthropocentric principle (or the so-called "fine-tuning" argument), which claims that the universe has precise values for certain physical constants and laws that make it possible for life to exist. Proponents of this view argue that the universe's design could only have been orchestrated by a conscious, purposeful designer. Further evidence cited for supernatural involvement includes the Cambrian explosion and other discontinuities in the paleontological record, as well as the belief that the information in the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) molecule must have had an intelligent author. Criticism of Creationism is that there is no scientific evidence that the universe was fine-tuned solely for the purpose of facilitating life, or that a conscious designer was responsible for it. Furthermore, the "Multiverse" hypothesis, which postulates that there can be many universes with different physical constants, offers a possible naturalistic explanation for why our universe possesses the properties that are observed. As for the paleontological discontinuities and the information in DNA, these are indeed interesting phenomena that have been and still are the subject of much scientific investigation. However, it is important to note that there is ongoing scientific debate about possible unguided mechanisms that could have caused the Cambrian explosion, and the information in DNA can, according to materialists, also be explained by natural processes such as evolution through natural selection.One of the Naturalistic theories about the origin of life on earth is Abiogenesis, which claims that life arose spontaneously from non-living matter through an optimal coincidence of chemical reactions under favourable conditions. This theory is based on the idea that the conditions on the early earth were perfect for the formation of simple organic molecules, which eventually gave rise to more complex structures capable of self-replication. The Miller- Urey experiment, for example, showed that simple organic molecules formed under conditions that, according to the knowledge at the time, were identical to those on early earth. However, this experiment was discredited over time because the researchers assumed that the primordial atmosphere consisted mainly of methane, ammonia, and water vapour, but later research showed that the early atmosphere more likely consisted of nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapour. In addition, some scientists have pointed out that the conditions simulated in the experiment were too reducing in nature (that is, too poor in oxygen), to accurately reflect the conditions on the early earth which had a more oxidizing atmosphere. Therefore, while the Miller-Urey experiment remains an important milestone in the history of origin of life research, it is widely recognised that its results should be viewed with caution and that its implications for the natural formation of life on earth should not be overstated. Another naturalistic theory is that life was brought to earth by comets or meteorites. This theory, known as Panspermia, suggests that life may have originated elsewhere in the universe and was transported to earth by comets or meteorites. Panspermia is supported by the discovery of organic molecules and microorganisms in some meteorites, as well as the presence of microbial life in extreme environments on earth that may be similar to conditions on other planets. Each of these theories has its own strengths and weaknesses and there is no consensus among scientists as to which theory is the most accurate. Abiogenesis, for example, is supported by the evidence of the formation of simple organic molecules under conditions, presumably like those on the early earth, but it is difficult to explain how these molecules gave rise to complex structures capable ofself-replication. Panspermia is in turn supported by the discovery of organic molecules and microorganisms in some meteorites, but this does not explain the original origin of life itself. Creationism, on the other hand is not directly supported by scientific evidence but is based on the interpretation of empirical data from a religious paradigm. The origin of life on earth therefore remains a subject of scientific inquiry and naturalistic explanations, based on empirical evidence and well-established scientific theories are still considered in mainstream science to be the only valid basis of human understanding of this complex and interesting subject. However, this normative materialist interpretation is increasingly being questioned by a growing number of eminent scholars. This article focuses on the origin and complexity of information as found in life on earth. All forms of information known to man, whether hieroglyphs, radio signals, printed media or TV broadcasts have an intelligent author, and the question is why mainstream science insists on considering the most complex information observed by humankind to date (namely the code in the DNA molecule), as strictly materialistic in origin.

J	Zhu, Y; Wang, X; Chen, LP; Nie, RC				Zhu, Ya; Wang, Xue; Chen, Luping; Nie, Rencan			CEFusion: Multi-Modal medical image fusion via cross encoder	IET IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article								Most existing deep learning-based multi-modal medical image fusion (MMIF) methods utilize single-branch feature extraction strategies to achieve good fusion performance. However, for MMIF tasks, it is thought that this structure cuts off the internal connections between source images, resulting in information redundancy and degradation of fusion performance. To this end, this paper proposes a novel unsupervised network, termed CEFusion. Different from existing architecture, a cross-encoder is designed by exploiting the complementary properties between the original image to refine source features through feature interaction and reuse. Furthermore, to force the network to learn complementary information between source images and generate the fused image with high contrast and rich textures, a hybrid loss is proposed consisting of weighted fidelity and gradient losses. Specifically, the weighted fidelity loss can not only force the fusion results to approximate the source images but also effectively preserve the luminance information of the source image through weight estimation, while the gradient loss preserves the texture information of the source image. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the method over the state-of-the-art in terms of subjective visual effect and quantitative metrics in various datasets.

Design Both questionnaire-based and telephone-based survey were used. The data were collected face to face, the first time by questionnaire and the second time by telephone. Methods One hundred and fifty-five patients completed valid survey questionnaires (response rate was about 70% in the first and 62% in the second round). The association of social support and optimism with subsequent DRSCA was examined after adjusting for demographics and disease information. Results Based on results, optimism was significantly associated with subsequent DRSCA. In the dimensions of social support, objective social support and support use were significantly associated with subsequent DRSCA. The results showed that the mediation of optimism between the dimensions of social support and DRSCA was not significant after controlling for covariates. The results also indicated that social support and optimism played directly an important role in improving diabetes-related self-care activities.

Based on this proposed pathophysiology, alternative treatments for acute-onset OCD have been introduced, including antibiotics and immunomodulatory interventions. However, the literature on treatment of PANDAS is diverse, and clinical consensus regarding optimal treatment strategy is lacking. We conducted a systematic review of articles in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus that addressed treatment for PANDAS and related disorders. Twelve research studies involving the following treatments met inclusion criteria: penicillin, azithromycin, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange, tonsillectomy, cognitive behavior therapy, NSAID and corticosteroids. In addition, 65 case reports in which patients received immunomodulatory treatments, antibiotics, and/or psychotropics were identified. We determined that rigorously conducted research regarding treatments for PANDAS is scarce, and published studies have a high risk of bias. Further research is needed in which promising treatment strategies for PANDAS and other variants of OCD with proposed autoimmune etiology are rigorously investigated.

Indispensable Resource? A Phenomenological Study of Textbook Use in Engineering Problem Solving	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						textbook; problem solving; phenomenology	STUDENTS; DESIGN; GROWTH	Background Textbooks play an important role in engineering education, influencing instructors' pedagogical approaches and providing much of the information students learn. Research has explored students' recollections of the roles that textbooks played in their educational experiences, but how students actually use textbooks remains largely unexplored. Purpose This phenomenological study describes engineering students' textbook use during problem-solving activities. This study directly examined how students employed a textbook in order to generate detailed descriptions of students' behaviors, approaches, and reflections regarding their actual problem-solving experiences. Method Ten senior materials engineering students (8 males and 2 females) were asked to think aloud while solving engineering problems. Follow-up retrospective interviews regarding the think aloud session were conducted to gain in-depth information on students' textbook use during the problem-solving activities. Results Students used the textbook primarily to find information related to problem constraints that were explicitly stated in the problem. Furthermore, textbook example problems exerted a strong influence on students' problem-solving processes. Students also reported limitations of the textbook, contrasting it to the diversity of resources available via the Internet. Conclusions This study provides insight into students' textbook use during engineering problem-solving activities. Students' limited application of the textbook during problem solving suggests that textbooks may not be serving their intended purposes.

J	Ma, SQ; Zhu, CH; Nie, M; Quan, DX				Ma, Shuquan; Zhu, Changhua; Nie, Min; Quan, Dongxiao			Efficient self-testing system for quantum computations based on permutations*	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						quantum computation; verification; self-testing systems; complexity theory		Verification in quantum computations is crucial since quantum systems are extremely vulnerable to the environment. However, verifying directly the output of a quantum computation is difficult since we know that efficiently simulating a large-scale quantum computation on a classical computer is usually thought to be impossible. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a self-testing system for quantum computations, which can be used to verify if a quantum computation is performed correctly by itself. Our basic idea is using some extra ancilla qubits to test the output of the computation. We design two kinds of permutation circuits into the original quantum circuit: one is applied on the ancilla qubits whose output indicates the testing information, the other is applied on all qubits (including ancilla qubits) which is aiming to uniformly permute the positions of all qubits. We show that both permutation circuits are easy to achieve. By this way, we prove that any quantum computation has an efficient self-testing system. In the end, we also discuss the relation between our self-testing system and interactive proof systems, and show that the two systems are equivalent if the verifier is allowed to have some quantum capacity.

J	Kunimoto, R; Vogt, M; Bajorath, J				Kunimoto, Ryo; Vogt, Martin; Bajorath, Jueren			Tracing compound pathways using chemical space networks	MEDCHEMCOMM			English	Article							MATCHED MOLECULAR PAIRS; DESIGN	Similarity-based compound networks are used as coordinate-free representations of chemical space. In so-called chemical space networks (CSNs), nodes represent compounds and edges pairwise similarity relationships. Nodes can be annotated with activity information, which enables visualization of structure-activity relationship (SAR) patterns. A major determinant of CSN structure and topology is the way in which similarity relationships are determined. Using different similarity measures, a number of CSN variants have been generated previously. Herein, we report a new type of CSN with an asymmetric similarity metric based upon the maximum common substructure of compound pairs. While CSNs have thus far mostly been used for SAR visualization, the new CSN variant was designed for another medicinal chemistry application, i. e. the identification of compound pathways in data sets. In this CSN, pathways consisting of structurally related compounds with increasing size can be systematically traced, which represent models of compound optimization paths. Compound series forming such paths can be extracted from the CSN. The network-based identification of hit-to-lead or lead optimization series in compound data sets is intuitive and thought to provide valuable information for medicinal chemistry.

However, I show that embedded covenants can generate price pressure in collateralized loan obligation (CLO) funds, even though such funds are closed end. Loans held by constrained CLOs report significantly lower cumulative returns than loans held by unconstrained CLOs. This can be explained by contractual arbitrage, a practice by which CLOs exploit loopholes in the design of covenants to mechanically loosen their covenants and avoid covenant breaches. Covenant breaches are associated with significant pecuniary and nonpecuniary costs, affecting CLO compensation, reputation, and career prospects. I show that when covenants breaches are imminent, managers fire sell distressed loans. Hence, I demonstrate a channel by which closed-end funds can also create fire sale risk, akin to their open-end counterparts.

J	van Niekerk, E; Ankiewicz, P; de Swardt, E				van Niekerk, Elsabe; Ankiewicz, Piet; de Swardt, Estelle			A process-based assessment framework for technology education: a case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN EDUCATION			English	Article						Technology education; Assessment; Assessment framework; Outcomes; Content; Assessment methodology	DESIGN	Over the past few years, educators in South Africa have been subjected to many changes in the educational sphere. Not only was a new approach to education, namely outcomes-based education (OBE) implemented, but the curriculum was also changed and now consists of eight learning areas, some of which are groupings of traditional school subjects (e.g. languages). Technology, however, is a new and for most educators unfamiliar learning area. The implementation in 1998 of the technology learning area in South African schools had educators reeling as they were unprepared and untrained to facilitate this new learning area. There was also limited information available for the assessment of learners in technology. Learners' competence in technology education should be assessed in a meaningful and responsible manner, which requires more than just the evaluation of the end product. The purpose of this research was to develop a process-based assessment framework to support the technology teacher with assessment activities, which incorporate the technological process and provide opportunities for the assessment of aspects of the thinking sub-processes as part of the technological process. Qualitative action research was undertaken. Three Grade 7 learners and a teacher at a parallel medium primary school (school where two official languages are used congruently as medium of instruction) were involved in the case study. Resource, case study and a capability task were done by the three learners. For the purpose of the research project, information obtained from the capability task was used. This research focused on the initial idea generation stage (stage five) of the technological process, as well as creative and critical thinking (as thinking sub-processes) processes. Observation and semi-structured interviews were used as data-collection methods. The validity and reliability of the research were ensured by means of triangulation. Three main categories (findings) were named as aspects which could be employed when compiling a process-based assessment framework, namely outcomes, content and assessment methodology. Further subcategories were identified within each of these main categories. The framework will serve as a roadmap to technology teachers, especially those with little or no pedagogical knowledge in technology to assist them to base their assessment on sound methodology.

J	Thompson, C; Stapley, S				Thompson, Carl; Stapley, Sally			Do educational interventions improve nurses' clinical decision making and judgement? A systematic review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES			English	Review						Decision making; Judgement; Educational activities; Systematic review	CRITICAL-THINKING; NURSING-EDUCATION; HEALTH-CARE; STUDENTS; STRATEGIES; QUALITY; DESIGN; TRIAL	Objectives: Despite the growing popularity of decision making in nursing curricula, the effectiveness of educational interventions to improve nursing judgement and decision making is unknown. We sought to synthesise and summarise the comparative evidence for educational interventions to improve nursing judgements and clinical decisions. Design: A systematic review. Data sources: Electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, Social Sciences Citation Index, OpenSIGLE conference proceedings and hand searching nursing journals. Review methods: Studies published since 1960, reporting any educational intervention that aimed to improve nurses' clinical judgements or decision making were included. Studies were assessed for relevance and quality. Data extracted included study design; educational setting; the nature of participants; whether the study was concerned with the clinical application of skills or the application of theory; the type of decision targeted by the intervention (e.g. diagnostic reasoning) and whether the evaluation of the intervention focused on efficacy or effectiveness. A narrative approach to study synthesis was used due to heterogeneity in interventions, study samples, outcomes and settings and incomplete reporting of effect sizes. Results: From 5262 initial citations 24 studies were included in the review. A variety of educational approaches were reported. Study quality and content reporting was generally poor. Pedagogical theories were widely used but use of decision theory (with the exception of subjective expected utility theory implicit in decision analysis) was rare. The effectiveness and efficacy of interventions was mixed. Conclusions: Educational interventions to improve nurses' judgements and decisions are complex and the evidence from comparative studies does little to reduce the uncertainty about 'what works'. Nurse educators need to pay attention to decision, as well as pedagogical, theory in the design of interventions. Study design and reporting requires improvement to maximise the information contained in reports of educational interventions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Through space thought experiments, three basic principles are established: (1) the key to the sensation of space is whether there is a sense of being marked; (2) the boundary is necessary but not sufficient for the generation of spatial perception; (3) the spatial scale must be comparable to the scale of the observer to create spatial perception. In the Raumplan, the sense of being marked between spaces is determined by the connection between the spaces. Mathematically, the connectivity allows field functions to be represented in the same coordinate system and thus to be comparable. Since the sense of being marked is mutual, there is no special reference space. Each space can be used as a reference space to mark another space, which corresponds to the equal weighting between rooms.

These emergent outcomes are thought to occur because communication among individuals results in community-wide synchronization. Here, we use experimental manipulations in lab-created networks to investigate how the temporal dynamics of conversations shape the formation of collective memories. We show that when individuals that bridge between clusters (i.e., bridge ties) communicate early on in a series of networked interactions, the network reaches higher mnemonic convergence compared to when individuals first interact within clusters (i.e., cluster ties). This effect, we show, is due to the tradeoffs between initial information diversity and accumulated overlap over time. Our approach provides a framework to analyze and design interventions in social networks that optimize information sharing and diminish the likelihood of information bubbles and polarization.

Objective: This study systematically reviewed and quantified the scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of BW training on balance performance. Methods: Keyword and reference search on BW training interventions was conducted in six electronic databases (PubMed, Web of science, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and CNKI) for peer-reviewed articles published till November 2017. A standardized form was used to extract data from each selected article that met the pre-specified eligibility criteria. Meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled effects of BW training on balance performance measures. Results: Eleven studies (nine randomized controlled trials and two pre-post studies) met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. All studies reported some beneficial effects of BW training on balance performance. Compared to control, BW training was associated with a reduction in overall stability index score by 0.99 (95% CI = 0.37, 1.61; I-2 = 0.0%; fixed-effect model), medial-lateral stability index score by 0.95 (95% CI = 0.34, 1.57; I-2 = 0.0%; fixed-effect model), and anterior-posterior stability index score by 0.99 (95% CI = 0.37, 1.61; I-2 = 0.0%; fixed-effect model). Meanwhile, BW training was associated with an increase in open-eyes single leg standing duration by 0.91 s (95% CI = 0.29, 1.53; I-2 = 75.9%; random-effect model) in comparison to control. Conclusions: BW training could serve as a potentially useful tool to improve balance performance among those with a high risk of fall. However, current evidence remains preliminary due to the small cohort of studies and possible learning effect in pre-post studies. Future work with larger scale and randomized experimental design is warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of BW training on balance performance across diverse population and disease subgroups, and elucidate the underlying biomechanical and neurological pathways.

J	Xiong, LZ; Shi, YQ				Xiong, Lizhi; Shi, Yunqing			On the Privacy-Preserving Outsourcing Scheme of Reversible Data Hiding over Encrypted Image Data in Cloud Computing	CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA			English	Article						Cloud data security; re-encryption; reversible data hiding; cloud computing; privacy-preserving		Advanced cloud computing technology provides cost saving and flexibility of services for users. With the explosion of multimedia data, more and more data owners would outsource their personal multimedia data on the cloud. In the meantime, some computationally expensive tasks are also undertaken by cloud servers. However, the outsourced multimedia data and its applications may reveal the data owner(,)s private information because the data owners lose the control of their data. Recently, this thought has aroused new research interest on privacy-preserving reversible data hiding over outsourced multimedia data. In this paper, two reversible data hiding schemes are proposed for encrypted image data in cloud computing: reversible data hiding by homomorphic encryption and reversible data hiding in encrypted domain. The former is that additional bits are extracted after decryption and the latter is that extracted before decryption. Meanwhile, a combined scheme is also designed. This paper proposes the privacy-preserving outsourcing scheme of reversible data hiding over encrypted image data in cloud computing, which not only ensures multimedia data security without relying on the trustworthiness of cloud servers, but also guarantees that reversible data hiding can be operated over encrypted images at the different stages.

This brief review emphasizes some of the ''new obstetrics'' from the viewpoint of perinatal medicine, particularly in tenus of neonatal teaching and the design of future neonatal research. The information that can be obtained about an infant prenatally by the use of ultrasound, power doppler, computerized fetal heart rate monitoring, cordocentesis, etc is extensive and yet, has rarely been utilized in the design of neonatal research protocols, It is becoming imperative that the ''new obstetrics'' be recognized and utilized in modern neonatal thinking if a truly ''perinatal medicine'' is to be practised.

M.; Krause, Jens; Wolf, Max			Quorums enable optimal pooling of independent judgements in biological systems	ELIFE			English	Article							CONSENSUS DECISION-MAKING; JURY THEOREM; INFORMATION; ACCURACY; SIZE; RULE	Collective decision-making is ubiquitous, and majority-voting and the Condorcet Jury Theorem pervade thinking about collective decision-making. Thus, it is typically assumed that majority-voting is the best possible decision mechanism, and that scenarios exist where individually-weak decision-makers should not pool information. Condorcet and its applications implicitly assume that only one kind of error can be made, yet signal detection theory shows two kinds of errors exist, 'false positives' and 'false negatives'. We apply signal detection theory to collective decision-making to show that majority voting is frequently sub-optimal, and can be optimally replaced by quorum decision-making. While quorums have been proposed to resolve within-group conflicts, or manage speed-accuracy trade-offs, our analysis applies to groups with aligned interests undertaking single-shot decisions. Our results help explain the ubiquity of quorum decision-making in nature, relate the use of sub- and super-majority quorums to decision ecology, and may inform the design of artificial decision-making systems. Editorial note: This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review. The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed (see decision letter).	[Marshall, James A.

J	Yang, Q; Yang, JH				Yang, Qi; Yang, Jong Hoon			Virtual Reconstruction of Visually Conveyed Images under Multimedia Intelligent Sensor Network Node Layout	JOURNAL OF SENSORS			English	Article							VISION	In this paper, multimedia intelligent sensing technology is applied to the virtual reconstruction of images to construct or restore images to the communication media for visual communication. This paper proposes image virtual reconstruction theory based on visual communication research, treats image virtual reconstruction content as open data links and customized domain ontology, establishes an interdisciplinary interactive research framework through the technical means of visual communication, solves the problem of data heterogeneity brought by image virtual reconstruction, and finally establishes a three-dimensional visualization research method and principle of visual communication. The research firstly visual communication cuts into the existing conservation principles and proposes the necessity of image virtual reconstruction from the perspective of visual communication; secondly, the thinking mode of digital technology is different from human thinking mode, and the process of calculation ignores the emotional and spiritual values, but the realization of value rationality must be premised on instrumental rationality. This requires a content judgment and self-examination of the technical dimensional model of image virtual reconstruction on top of comprehensive literature and empirical evidence. In response to the research difficulties such as the constructivity of visual communication, the solution of image virtual reconstruction of visual communication is proposed based on the data collection method and literature characteristics. The process of introducing the tools of computer science into humanity research needs to be placed in a continuous critical theory system due to the uncontrollable and subjective nature of visual content, and finally, based on the construction of information models for image virtual reconstruction, the ontology and semantics of information modeling are thoroughly investigated, and the problems related to them, such as interpretation, wholeness, and interactivity, are analyzed and solved one by one. The transparency of image virtual reconstruction is enhanced through the introduction of interactive metadata, and this theoretical system of virtual restoration is put into practice in the Dunhuang digital display design project.

Nanoscale Synaptic Membrane Mimetic Allows Unbiased High Throughput Screen That Targets Binding Sites for Alzheimer's-Associated Aβ Oligomers	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PRION PROTEIN; MOLECULAR-BASIS; MOUSE MODEL; RECEPTOR; DISEASE; TOXICITY; BRAIN; NEURODEGENERATION; PERMEABILIZATION; PHOSPHORYLATION	Despite their value as sources of therapeutic drug targets, membrane proteomes are largely inaccessible to high-throughput screening (HTS) tools designed for soluble proteins. An important example comprises the membrane proteins that bind amyloid beta oligomers (A beta Os). A beta Os are neurotoxic ligands thought to instigate the synapse damage that leads to Alzheimer's dementia. At present, the identities of initial A beta O binding sites are highly uncertain, largely because of extensive protein-protein interactions that occur following attachment of A beta Os to surface membranes. Here, we show that A beta O binding sites can be obtained in a state suitable for unbiased HTS by encapsulating the solubilized synaptic membrane proteome into nanoscale lipid bilayers (Nanodiscs). This method gives a soluble membrane protein library (SMPL)-a collection of individualized synaptic proteins in a soluble state. Proteins within SMPL Nanodiscs showed enzymatic and ligand binding activity consistent with conformational integrity. A beta Os were found to bind SMPL Nanodiscs with high affinity and specificity, with binding dependent on intact synaptic membrane proteins, and selective for the higher molecular weight oligomers known to accumulate at synapses. Combining SMPL Nanodiscs with a mix-incubate-read chemiluminescence assay provided a solution-based HTS platform to discover antagonists of A beta O binding. Screening a library of 2700 drug-like compounds and natural products yielded one compound that potently reduced A beta O binding to SMPL Nanodiscs, synaptosomes, and synapses in nerve cell cultures. Although not a therapeutic candidate, this small molecule inhibitor of synaptic A beta O binding will provide a useful experimental antagonist for future mechanistic studies of A beta Os in Alzheimer's model systems. Overall, results provide proof of concept for using SMPLs in high throughput screening for A beta O binding antagonists, and illustrate in general how a SMPL Nanodisc system can facilitate drug discovery for membrane protein targets.

Systematic review. Objective. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of catastrophizing on treatment efficacy and outcome in patients treated for low back pain. Summary of Background Data. Psychological factors including catastrophizing thoughts are thought to increase the risk for chronic low back pain. The influence of catastrophizing is debated. Methods. In September 2012, the following databases were searched: BIOSIS, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, OTseeker, PeDRO, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science. For 50 of 706 references, full text was assessed. Results based on 11 studies were included in this analysis. Results. In the 11 studies, a total of 2269 patients were included. Seven studies were of good and 4 of moderate methodological quality. Heterogeneity in study settings, treatments, outcomes, and patient populations impeded meta-analysis. Catastrophizing at baseline was predictive for disability at follow-up in 4 studies and for pain in 2 studies. Three studies found no predictive effect of catastrophizing. A mediating effect was found in all studies (n = 5) assessing the impact of a decrease in catastrophizing during treatment. A greater decrease was associated with better outcome. Most studies that investigated the moderating effects on treatment efficacy found no effect (n = 5). However, most studies did not look for a direct interaction between the treatment and catastrophizing thoughts. No study investigated the influence of catastrophizing on work-related outcomes including return to work. Conclusion. Catastrophizing predicted degree of pain and disability and mediated treatment efficacy in most studies. The presence of catastrophizing should be considered in patients with persisting back pain. Limited evidence was found for the moderating effects on treatment efficacy. Future research should aim to clarify the role of catastrophizing as a moderator of outcome and investigate its importance for work-related outcomes.

With their large surface area, they hold promise for inhibiting protein-protein interactions, a chemical space that was thought to be undruggable. Although many chemical methods have been developed for peptide macrocyclization, enzymatic methods have emerged as a promising new economical approach. Thus far, most enzymes have been shown to act on l-peptides; their ability to cyclize d-amino-acid-containing peptides has rarely been documented. Herein we show that macrocycles consisting of d-amino acids, except for the Asn residue at the ligating site, were efficiently synthesized by butelase1, an Asn/Asp-specific ligase. Furthermore, by using a peptide-library approach, we show that butelase1 tolerates most of the d-amino acid residues at the P1 and P2 positions.	[Nguyen, Giang K.

The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, is challenging interaction between humans and machines changing the service systems' value co-creation configurations and logic. To envision possible future scenarios, this paper aims to reflect upon how the humans' use of AI technology can impact value co-creation. Design/methodology/approach The study is developed, at a conceptual level, using selected elements from managerial and marketing theoretical frameworks interested in value co-creation - Service-Dominant Logic, Service Science and Viable Systems Approach (VSA) - used as interpretative tools to reframe value co-creation in the digital age. Findings The interpretative approach adopted and, in particular, the new VSA notion of Intelligence Augmentation (IA), in the perspective of the information variety model, shed new light on value co-creation in the digital age framing a possible "IA effect" that can empower value co-creation in complex decision-making contexts. Practical implications The study provides insights useful in the design and management of service systems suggesting a rethinking of the view of AI as a means for mainly increasing the smartness of service systems and a new focus on the enhancement of the human resources contribution to make the service systems wiser. Originality/value The paper provides a refocused interpretative view of the interaction between humans and AI that looks at a possible positive impact of the use of AI on humans in terms of augmented decision-making capabilities in conditions of complexity.

In a multi-study, mixed method design, we presented university students with science content that relayed conceptual discrepancies and collected quantitative and qualitative data to study how students responded to discrepancies. In Study 1 (n = 42), we collected eye tracking patterns, study times, and metacognitive ratings and found that participants adapted their behavioral processing as a function of their epistemic cognition and discrepancy type. In Study 2 (n = 20), we collected concurrent think-aloud protocols and retrospective interviews to further explore why discrepancies were noticed (or not) and how they were resolved. Results revealed that prior knowledge and epistemic self-efficacy in oneself as an evaluator of knowledge emerged as important themes to detecting and efficiently resolving discrepancies.

If organizations successfully adopt a motivational climate, such climate influences the performance and behavior of employees to a great extent. Responsible leadership plays a constructive role in injecting a motivational climate in an organization to ensure information flow. In a motivational climate, top management or leaders reward their employees for individual progress, improvement and mastery. Knowledge sharing is supported in a mastery climate because such a climate can reduce the motive of knowledge hiding and instead further help in stimulating creativity. Design/methodology/approach Study was to scrutinize a moderated-mediation model, a quantitative hypothetic deductive approach to verify the hypotheses of the study. The data were gathered from employees and supervisors of advertising agencies and marketing departments in metropolitan cities of Punjab, Pakistan. Such firms and departments are considered because they offer a great opportunity to relevant variables and their relations. These organizations and departments are the most creativity-seeking domains and involve frequent interactions (for instance, regular meetings) between leaders with their employees and among peers. Data were primarily gathered from managerial employees performing their duties in the areas mentioned above. Findings Current study reveals that RL has a positive and significant relation with employee creative behaviour. Increasing RL characteristics can ultimately boost employee performance in the creativity domain. Being a responsible leader becomes mandatory for leaders to foster employee creativity to maintain the sustainability of an organization. It is confirmed from the results that responsible leadership articulates the mind thinking of employees, which creates an open environment of information while persuading creative and similar behaviour. Originality/value The current research investigates how responsible leadership can efficiently leverage the stakeholder approach in influencing employees through a knowledge-based pathway to boost their creative behaviour. The current study tends to uncover the mediating effect of the basic construct of knowledge management, which is knowledge sharing. Knowledge sharing enables employees to exchange their information while creating mutual understanding, which helps in the smooth flow of knowledge within the organization; this flow enriches employees to think openly in a creative and appreciative environment.

This review is based largely on discussions held at a meeting of the COST B9 Action, entitled 'Bioenergetics of Protozoan Parasites'. The major questions posed were: which enzymes are the best to target; what further information is required to allow their use for rational drug development; what compounds would constitute the best inhibitors and which of the enzymes of the pentose-phosphate pathway are present inside the glycosomes, as well? Only partial answers could be obtained in many cases, but the interactive discussion between the multidisciplinary group of participants, comprising chemists, biochemists and molecular biologists, provided thought-provoking ideas and will help direct future research.

Understanding "Why:" How Implicit Questions Shape Explanation Preferences	COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Article						Explanation; Teleology; Mechanism; Why questions	TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATIONS; DESIGN; PURPOSE; ARTIFACTS; CHILDREN	Adults and children 'promiscuously' endorse teleological answers to 'why' questions-a tendency linked to arguments that humans are intuitively theistic and naturally unscientific. But how do people arrive at an endorsement of a teleological answer? Here, we show that the endorsement of teleological answers need not imply unscientific reasoning (n = 880). A series of experiments show that (a) 'why' questions can be understood as a query for one of two distinct kinds of information and (b) these "implicit questions" can explain adults' answer preferences without appeal to unscientific worldviews. As a strong test of this view, we show that people endorse teleological answers that can answer relevant (implicit) questions about something's purpose, even when those answers are explicitly non-causal. Thus, we argue that endorsement of teleological answers does not necessarily equate to the endorsement of teleological 'explanations': Instead, explanation preferences may simply be an indication of people's pragmatic expectations about the questions that others ask. This view reframes how we should think about explanation preferences in general, while also offering practical insight into the pragmatics of question asking.

Effects of the Informed Health Choices podcast on the ability of parents of primary school children in Uganda to assess the trustworthiness of claims about treatment effects: one-year follow up of a randomised trial	TRIALS			English	Article						Podcast; Health choices; Treatment effects; Evidence-informed decision-making; Critical thinking; Health literacy; Evidence-based health care; Informed health choices; Claims about treatment effects	INCOME INEQUALITY; POPULATION HEALTH; TESTS; EXPECTATIONS; DETERMINANT; INFORMATION; ATTITUDES; NUMERACY; BARRIERS; INTERNET	Introduction Earlier, we designed and evaluated an educational mass media intervention for improving people's ability to think more critically and to assess the trustworthiness of claims (assertions) about the benefits and harms (effects) of treatments. The overall aims of this follow-up study were to evaluate the impact of our intervention 1 year after it was administered, and to assess retention of learning and behaviour regarding claims about treatments. Methods We randomly allocated consenting parents to listen to either the Informed Health Choices podcast (intervention) or typical public service announcements about health issues (control) over 7-10 weeks. Each intervention episode explained how the trustworthiness of treatment claims can be assessed by using relevant key concepts of evidence-informed decision-making. Participants listened to two episodes per week, delivered by research assistants. We evaluated outcomes immediately, and a year after the intervention. Primary outcomes were mean score and the proportion with a score indicating a basic ability to apply the key concepts (> 11 out of 18 correct answers) on a tool measuring people's ability to critically appraise the trustworthiness of treatment claims. Skills decay/retention was estimated by calculating the relative difference between the follow-up and initial results in the intervention group, adjusting for chance. Statistical analyses were performed using R (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria; version 3.4.3). Results After 1 year, the mean score for parents in the intervention group was 58.9% correct answers, compared to 52.6% in the control (adjusted mean difference of 6.7% (95% CI 3.3% to 10.1%)). In the intervention group, 47.2% of 267 parents had a score indicating a basic ability to assess treatment claims compared to 39.5% of 256 parents in the control (adjusted difference of 9.8% more parents (95% CI 0.9% to 18.9%). These represent relative reductions of 29% in the mean scores and 33% in the proportion of parents with a score indicating a basic ability to assess the trustworthiness of claims about treatment effects. Conclusions Although listening to the Informed Health Choices podcast initially led to a large improvement in the ability of parents to assess claims about the effects of treatments, our findings show that these skills decreased substantially over 1 year. More active practice could address the substantial skills decay observed over 1 year.

However the influence of depression during FEP on longer-term mortality is not certain. Existing evidence was synthesised to understand the influence of depressive symptoms during FEP on subsequent suicidal behaviour. Methods: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, OpenGrey, and NICE Evidence were searched from inception to Jan 25, 2017. Longitudinal observational studies assessing the relationship between depressive symptoms during FEP with a measure of s at a specified follow-up time were included. Summary estimates were extracted. The Downs and Black Instrument was used to appraise study quality. Odds ratio (OR) of suicidal behaviour were calculated using random effects meta-analyses. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017055881). Results: Of 4210 articles found, 23 fulfilled eligibility criteria. 13 were included in meta-analysis (n = 3002). 428 participants demonstrated suicidal behaviour in the study periods. Odds of suicidal behaviour during follow-up were significantly higher among patients with depressive symptoms during FEP compared to those without (OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.14-2.21; I2 = 50.0%, p = 0.02). Meta-regression demonstrated no evidence of influence of length of follow-up on results. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms during FEP are associated with increased longer-term risk of suicidal behaviour. This association should be acknowledged during early management planning. Large-scale clinical trials are needed to identify efficacious management of depression during FEP. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[McGinty, Jessica; Haque, M.

Herein, upon the fact that vibrational frequency of O-H is greater than O- D, we design a dynamic Eu(III)-macrocycle Eu-2a with two emitters which exhibits the imine bond breakage of macrocycle emitter H2L2a in H2O or D2O, resulting in the turn-on fluorescence of Eu(III) emitter. For their differential fluorescence sensing signals of Eu-2a on three emission bands (433, 500 and 615 nm), the statistical analysis method is employed to produce fully separated fingerprints and thus high-throughput discrimination of 13 common solvents, especially the H2O and D2O. Fluorescent titration experiments by instrumental or smartphone-based analysis method also prove the successful determination of proportional H2O/D2O mixtures together with the good sensitivity and wide linear response range. Moreover, this H2O-triggered fluorescent complex Eu-2a used as the fluorescence ink also shows its potential in information encryption application. This article must be a valuable reference for the areas of lanthanide-based luminescent material, multianalyte detection and information encryption.

Woody species were largely excluded from these early experiments, despite the ecological and socioeconomic importance of forest ecosystems. We discuss conceptual aspects of mechanistically driven research on the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship in forests, including the comparison of scientific approaches like 'observational studies', 'removal experiments', and 'synthetic-assemblage experiments'. We give a short overview on the differences between herbaceous and forest ecosystems, focusing on canopy characteristics, and the possibilities for individual versus population-based investigations. We present detailed information about the first large-scale, multisite and long-term biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment with tree species of temperate forests (BIOTREE - BIOdiversity and ecosystem processes in experimental TREE stands). At three sites of differing geology and local climate, we planted 200,000 saplings on a total area of 70 ha. At two sites, diversity gradients were established by varying the number of tree species (BIOTREE-SPECIES). At a third site, only functional diversity at a constant level of tree species richness was manipulated by selecting mixtures that differ in the functional trait values of the corresponding species (BIOTREE-FD). Additional experimental treatments at the subplot level include silvicultural management options, the addition of subdominant species, and the reduction of genetic diversity. Response variables focus on productivity, biogeochemical cycles and carbon sequestration, and resource use complementarity. We explore the use of different measures of functional diversity for a posteriori classifications of functional richness and their use in the analysis of our tree diversity experiment. The experiment is thought to provide a long-term research platform for a variety of scientific questions related to forest biodiversity and ecosystem processes. (c) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich.

In particular, information technology (IT) implementation is a field that needs more significant focus and a wider range of creative interventions. The author would undoubtedly see a more human-focused approach to HR management (HRM) in the post-coronavirus disease 2019 (post-COVID-19) era, where enterprises and workers have had to reinvent themselves in a brief amount of time drastically. Following the nationwide lockdown caused by COVID-19, many companies were pushed to opt for remote working, which presents both difficulties and benefits for workers and employers. So the purpose of this study is to investigate some key consequences resulting from COVID-19's effect on multiple HRM roles, how technology is empowering and fostering HRM, informative forecasts based on how organizations are coping and finally, the path in the post-pandemic environment. Design/methodology/approach The COVID-19 epidemic has had a significant effect on every area of the global economy. It has had severe implications for public institutions and raises particular questions for medical schools. The emergence of COVID-19 has disrupted many activities and requires intense and prompt attention from medical educators. So, HR leaders now face the difficult task of managing the interests of workers and their corporations. The outbreak of COVID-19 has proved that this is not just a difficult time but rather a testing time for companies across the globe to check and ensure how swiftly they adapt themselves by thinking and planning differently. An enterprise evolves with nature, and change is unavoidable if performance and productivity are to improve. Changes in structure, technology and priorities are overgrowing, posing big obstacles to leaders. Corporations worldwide have looked to technology to pursue creative solutions to some of the world's most pressing problems. This study provides a review of articles related to the role of technology in HRM in the COVID-19 period. The analyzed articles are divided into three groups, including articles related to the role of information communication technology, cloud computing and teleworking in HRM in the COVID-19 era. Also, the most important key challenges are collected, and solutions are provided for them. Findings In times of trouble, authentic leadership shines through. The actions of pioneering HR leaders throughout the COVID-19 epidemic will significantly affect their respective organizations. When COVID-19 expanded around the world, HR agencies made their workers' health and welfare a top priority. HRM's long-term sustainability can be dictated by how they deal with the current crisis. Web-based solutions, such as cloud computing, will also address a vital resource allocation gap. It illustrates the possible efficacy of patient-oriented, web-based applications built on result-driven design, which continues to be validated by more testing and assessment. Many studies have emphasized business innovation as a necessity due to changes in the environment and various challenges and requirements facing businesses. The challenge of observing social distance and limiting face-to-face business services is the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic era. Research limitations/implications This study could entail a joint international collaboration initiative among research centers, allowing information about COVID-19 impacts to be shared more easily. It will favor a worldwide policy to find a response to the epidemic but still address cultural and social issues. Practical implications The survey concludes that, whenever possible, employers and medicals should explore remote working opportunities in all industries to alleviate uncertainty and improve employee psychological well-being. The facilitating considerations and problems are often addressed in order to supply practical views for developing cloud-based solutions. Originality/value This research aims to lead to the advancement of scientific knowledge in the HRM area through the use of IT-based technology. It allows businesses to reinvent HRM techniques to save money and maximize efficiency without compromising their employees' life quality and well-being. More in-depth studies at various pandemic stages would yield more valuable insights into HRM's emerging position.

There is a need for new insight tasks to probe and extend the limits of existing theories and cognitive frameworks. To shed more light on this fascinating issue, we addressed the question: Is it possible to convey a well-known card sorting game into an insight task? We introduced different conditions and tested them via two online experiments (N = 546). Between the conditions we systematically varied the available perceptual features, and the existence of non-obvious rules. We found that our card sorting game elicited insight experience. In the first experiment, our data revealed that solution strategies and insight experience varied by the availability and saliency of perceptual features. The discovery of a non-obvious rule, which is not hinted at by perceptual features, was most difficult. With our new paradigm, we were able to construe ambiguous problems which allowed participants to find more than one solution strategy. Interestingly, we realized interindividual preferences for different strategies. The same problem drove strategies which either relied on feature integration or on more deliberate strategies. The second experiment varied the degree of independence of a sorting rule from the standard rules which were in accordance with prior knowledge. It was shown that the more independent the hidden rule was, the more difficult the task became. In sum, we demonstrated a new insight task which extended the available task domains and shed light on sequential and multi-step rule learning problems. Finally, we provided a first sketch of a cognitive model that should help to integrate the data within the existing literature on cognitive models and speculated about the generalizability of the interplay of prior knowledge modification and variation for problem solving.

Study Design: A quasi-experimental study. Place and Duration of Study: Kunming Medical University, from September 2014 to January 2015. Methodology: One hundred and twenty-two (122) third year undergraduate medical students, starting a 48-hour lecture-based pharmacology course, volunteered to use mind maps as one of their study strategies (intervention group), while the remaining 100 students in the class continued to use their usual study strategies (control group) over the duration of the course. The performance of both groups in the final course examination was compared. Students in the intervention group also completed a questionnaire on the usefulness of mind maps during the course and in preparation for the final examination. Results: The students' performance of intervention group was superior to performance of the control group in all parts of a multi-modal final examination. For the multiple choice questions and comprehensive scores, average marks of 45.97 +/- 7.22 and 68.07 +/- 12.77, respectively were acquired by the control group, and 51.77 +/- 4.95 (p < 0.01) and 80.05 +/- 7.54 (p < 0.01), respectively by the intervention group. The median IQR scores for "filling in the blanks" questions, short answers questions and case analyses, were 6.00 (6.00), 8.00 (3.50), 8.75 (5.88), respectively for the control group, and were all significantly higher at 8.00 (4.00) (p = 0.024), 10.00 (2.00) (p < 0.001), and 11.00 (3.25) (p = 0.002), respectively for the intervention group. Questionnaire responses showed that 95.45% thought that mind maps helped them to prepare more efficiently for the final exam; 90.91% believed that mind maps helped them to better understand all of pharmacology. Ninety-one percent also thought that mind maps would help them to better understand other disciplines, and 86.36% students would like the lecturers to utilize mind mapping as an alternative to conventional teaching formats, such as the use of Power Point. Conclusion: The addition of mind maps to students' study of pharmacology at Kunming Medical University improved their performance in all aspects of a multi-modal final examination.

A transcriptomic scan for potential candidate genes involved in osmoregulation in an obligate freshwater palaemonid prawn (<i>Macrobrachium australiense</i>)	PEERJ			English	Article						Transcriptome; Osmoregulation; Macrobrachium australiense; Hepatopancreas; Illumina; Antennal gland; Gill	ALKALINE-PHOSPHATASE ACTIVITY; ANALYSIS PROVIDES INSIGHTS; NA/K-ATPASE ACTIVITIES; CARBONIC-ANHYDRASE; ARGININE KINASE; LITOPENAEUS-VANNAMEI; EURYHALINE CRABS; WHITE SHRIMP; EXPRESSION ANALYSIS; CARCINUS-MAENAS	Background. Understanding the genomic basis of osmoregulation (candidate genes and/or molecular mechanisms controlling the phenotype) addresses one of the fundamental questions in evolutionary ecology. Species distributions and adaptive radiations are thought to be controlled by environmental salinity levels, and efficient osmoregulatory (ionic balance) ability is the main mechanism to overcome the problems related to environmental salinity gradients. Methods. To better understand how osmoregulatory performance in freshwater (FW) crustaceans allow individuals to acclimate and adapt to raised salinity conditions, here we (i), reviewed the literature on genes that have been identified to be associated with osmoregulation in FW crustaceans, and (ii), performed a transcriptomic analysis using cDNA libraries developed from mRNA isolated from three important osmoregulatory tissues (gill, antennal gland, hepatopancreas) and total mRNA from post larvae taken from the freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium australiense using Illumina deep sequencing technology. This species was targeted because it can complete its life cycle totally in freshwater but, like many Macrobrachium sp., can also tolerate brackish water conditions and hence should have genes associated with tolerance of both FW and saline conditions. Results. We obtained between 55.4 and 65.2 million Illumina read pairs from four cDNA libraries. Overall, paired end sequences assembled into a total of 125,196 non redundant contigs (>= 200 bp) with an N50 length of 2,282 bp and an average contig length of 968 bp. Transcriptomic analysis of M. australiense identified 32 different gene families that were potentially involved with osmoregulatory capacity. A total of 32,597 transcripts were specified with gene ontology (GO) terms identified on the basis of GO categories. Abundance estimation of expressed genes based on TPM (transcript per million) >= 20 showed 1625 transcripts commonly expressed in all four libraries. Among the top 1-0 genes expressed in four tissue libraries associated with osmoregulation, arginine kinase and Na+/K+- ATPase showed the highest transcript copy number with 7098 and 660, respectively in gill which is considered to be the most important organ involved in osmoregulation. Discussion The current study, provides the first broad transcriptome from M. australiense using next generation sequencing and identifies potential candidate genes involved in salinity tolerance and osmoregulation that can provide a foundation for investigating osmoregulatory cap capacity in a wide variety of freshwater crustaceans.

J	Li, XS; Wang, WJ				Li, Xiaoshan; Wang, Wenjing			Exploring Spatial Cognitive Process Among STEM Students and Its Role in STEM Education A Cognitive Neuroscience Perspective	SCIENCE & EDUCATION			English	Article							PATH-INTEGRATION; ABILITY; ARGUMENTATION; PERFORMANCE; THINKING; IMPACT; NAVIGATION; MAP; REFUTATIONS; HIPPOCAMPUS	Spatial ability is a powerful systematic source of individual differences in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and technology (STEM). Abundant research has evidenced that psychometrically assessed spatial ability is a strong predictor of STEM achievement. However, its underlying cognitive process and relevant role in STEM education are unknown. From the perspective of cognitive neuroscience, spatial ability is also considered a human intelligence deriving from the cognitive processing of spatial information in the brain. With the help of the cognitive neuroscience paradigm of spatial navigation, in the present work, we investigate the spatial cognitive process among STEM students and its role in STEM education. A total of 172 undergraduates majoring in veterinary science participated in a spatial navigation test. Participants attempted to return a toy to its original place in an arena when given either internal self-motion cues only, external landmark cues only, or both in a spatial navigation task. Modelling analysis of 172 participants' spatial navigation behaviours showed that all the participants' spatial cognitive processes featured navigation cue integration. The results of the different tests showed that students with higher levels of navigation cue integration had better academic performance in STEM learning. The results also indicated that, surprisingly, better academic performance in science and mathematics relied more on the use of internal self-motion cues, while better academic performance in engineering and technology relied more on the use of external landmark cues. This study sheds some light on the spatial cognitive process and its role in STEM education from the cognitive neuroscience perspective, thus deepening the functional understanding of spatial ability as a systemic source of individual differences for STEM education, and provides an empirical reference point for interdisciplinary studies on the role of cognition in the context of STEM education. Implications on STEM learning design and STEM teaching were discussed.

We collected quantitative data from December 24, 2020, to January 16, 2021, and qualitative data from February 19 to March 30, 2021. We conducted a telephone survey among a marginal quota sample of 607 people over 18 years old. We performed descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses with R software for the quantitative phase; and performed manual content analyses for the qualitative phase. We surveyed 607 people for the quantitative phase and interviewed 30 people for the qualitative phase. Individuals who hesitated or refused to be vaccinated represented 12.9% and 32.8%, respectively. Vaccine hesitancy was related to gender, living in large cities, having a poor attitude toward the vaccine, thinking that the vaccine would not help protect them from the virus, being influenced by people important to them, and lacking information from health professionals. Vaccine refusal was related to living in large cities, having a poor attitude toward the vaccine, thinking that the vaccine would not help protect them from the virus, thinking that the vaccine could endanger their health, trusting opinions of people who were important to them, and lacking information from health professionals. The results of the study show that the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and refusal are diverse and complex. Addressing these factors will help to ensure better vaccination coverage. Governments and health authorities should intensify their efforts to promote vaccine confidence and reduce misinformation.

Refractive error (i.e., myopia, hyperopia or astigmatism) is a condition where the refracting system of the eye fails to focus objects sharply on the retina. As a consequence refractive errors cause blurred vision. We subdivided 84 individuals according to their spherical equivalent refraction into Emmetropes (control individuals without refractive errors) and Ametropes (individuals with refractive errors). Participants performed a vividness task and completed a questionnaire that explored their cognitive style of thinking before their vision was checked by an ophthalmologist. Although results showed that Ametropes had less vivid mental images than Emmetropes this did not affect the development of their cognitive style of thinking; in fact, Ametropes were able to use both verbal and visual strategies to acquire and retrieve information. Present data are consistent with the hypothesis of equivalence between imagery and perception.

However, within the wind power industry, sustainability research, including life cycle assessments, has been focused mostly on technology innovation at the material (e.g. permanent magnets), components (e.g. blades) or product level (e.g. new assets). Research analysing the implementation of circular business models in the wind industry is scarce. Such information could, however, support more robust decision-making in the development of system-level innovations for the deployment of more resource-efficient and sustainable wind energy infrastructure. Building upon practical methods for the identification, categorisation and characterisation of business models, 14 circular business models with application to the wind industry were comprehensively evaluated through the revision of 125 documents, including 56 journal papers, 46 industrial business cases and 23 wind technology management reports. Each circular business model is examined according to i) business offering and drivers, ii) value creation, delivery and capture mechanisms, iii) sustainability benefits and trade-offs, and iv) industrial challenges and opportunities. Accordingly, comprehensive guidelines to drive political (legislation design and implementation), industrial (technology and business innovation) and academic (further research) actions, are provided. Though the results are focussed on the wind industry, the general findings and recommendations are relevant across the renewable and low-carbon energy sector.

Knowledge building (KB) is an instructional approach designed to support both deep learning and the development of these skills. In KB learners engage in a sustained discourse to share knowledge, formulate and refine inquiries, and continually improve their collective ideas and understanding of authentic problems. This paper presents an example of applying KB in an undergraduate engineering mechanics course. Data from 77 students engaging in KB and the discourse record of a KB team consisting of 8 students was examined to look for indications of 21st century skill development. Evidence was found supporting high-level creativity and innovation, communication, collaboration/teamwork, information literacy/research, critical thinking and metacognition skills. The discourse also provided evidence that the class was centered on the learner, knowledge, community, and assessment-all best practices for designing learning environments.

To explore the differing perspectives of patients and providers and their assessment of supportive care needs in breast cancer patients receiving oral chemotherapy. Background. The patient-provider concordance in patients' needs assessment is critical to the effective management of cancer. Self-administered oral chemotherapy greatly shifts responsibilities for side-effect monitoring, symptom management and dose adjustments from the provider to the patient. Home-based care plans will be central to the effective management of these patients. Design. A descriptive qualitative design was used. Methods. A purposive sample of nine breast cancer patients, four oncologists and four oncology nurses were recruited in Shanghai, China. Semi-structured and in-depth interviews were conducted to collect data. A qualitative content analysis aimed at finding manifest and latent meanings of data was applied to analyse the information. Results. Four themes of needs emerged from the interviews with patients and providers: information/knowledge, communication, social support and symptom management, but patients and providers only agreed on the assessment of symptom and side-effects management needs. Patients want more positive encouraging information from providers, but providers think patients need more information of efficacy and safety. Patients appreciate support from other peer patients with similar experiences, but providers think the support from families and friends are readily available to them. Patients discussed their spiritual needs, while oncologists see the need to improve patient adherence to medication. Conclusion. Breast cancer patients differed from their providers in assessment of healthcare needs. Further investigation of the relationships between patient-provider discordance and patient outcomes may guide interventions to improve care for cancer patients receiving oral chemotherapy. Relevance to clinical practice. Oncology nurses should develop a holistic home-based care plan by exploring and integrating the discordance of needs assessment of both patients and health providers.

Work-related stress is thought to be a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes; however, this association has not been widely studied, and the findings that have been reported are inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to explore the association between work-related stress and risk for type 2 diabetes. Methods A systematic literature search and manual search limited to articles published in English were performed to select the prospective cohort studies evaluated the association between work-related stress and risk for type 2 diabetes up to September 2014 from four electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science. A random-effects model was used to estimate the overall risk. Results No significant association was found between work-related stress and risk for type 2 diabetes based on meta-analysis of seven prospective cohort studies involving 214,086 participants and 5,511 cases ( job demands: relative risk 0.94 [95% confidence interval 0.721.23]; decision latitude: relative risk 1.16 [0.85-1.58]; job strain: relative risk 1.12 [.0.951.32]). However, an association between work-related stress and risk for type 2 diabetes was observed in women ( job strain: relative risk 1.22 [1.01-1.46]) (P=0.04). A sensitivity analysis conducted by excluding one study in each turn yielded similar results. No publication bias was detected with a funnel plot despite the limited number of studies included in the analysis. Conclusions The results of this meta-analysis did not confirm a direct association between work-related stress and risk for type 2 diabetes. In subgroup analyses we found job strain was a risk factor for type 2 diabetes in women.

J	Head, BW				Head, Brian W.			Forty years of wicked problems literature: forging closer links to policy studies	POLICY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Wicked problems; problem framing; policy capacity; complex problem-solving; collaboration; information uncertainty	CAPACITY; CHALLENGES; GOVERNANCE; KNOWLEDGE; POLITICS; SYSTEMS; US	Rittel and Webber boldly challenged the conventional assumption that scientific' approaches to social policy and planning provide the most reliable guidance for practitioners and researchers who are addressing complex, and contested, social problems. This provocative claim, that scientific-technical approaches would not work' for complex social issues, has engaged policy analysts, academic researchers and planning practitioners since the 1970s. Grappling with the implications of complexity and uncertainty in policy debates, the first generation of wicked problem' scholars generally agreed that wicked issues require correspondingly complex and iterative approaches. This tended to quarantine complex wicked' problems as a special category that required special collaborative processes. Most often they recommended the inclusion of multiple stakeholders in exploring the relevant issues, interests, value differences and policy responses. More than four decades later, however, there are strong arguments for developing a second-generation approach which would mainstream' the analysis of wicked problems in public policy. While continuing to recognize the centrality of complexity and uncertainty, and the need for creative thinking, a broader approach would make better use of recent public policy literatures on such topics as problem framing, policy design, policy capacity and the contexts of policy implementation.

Community dashboards to support data-informed decision-making in the HEALing communities study	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						Opioid use disorder; Overdose; Dashboards; Implementation science; Interventions; Health surveillance; Information visualization; Helping to End Addiction Long-term; HEALing Communities Study	ACCEPTANCE; TECHNOLOGY	Background: With opioid misuse, opioid use disorder (OUD), and opioid overdose deaths persisting at epidemic levels in the U.S., the largest implementation study in addiction research-the HEALing Communities Study (HCS)-is evaluating the impact of the Communities That Heal (CTH) intervention on reducing opioid overdose deaths in 67 disproportionately affected communities from four states (i.e., "sites"). Community-tailored dashboards are central to the CTH intervention's mandate to implement a community-engaged and data-driven process. These dashboards support a participating community's decision-making for selection and monitoring of evidence-based practices to reduce opioid overdose deaths. Methods/Design: A community-tailored dashboard is a web-based set of interactive data visualizations of community-specific metrics. Metrics include opioid overdose deaths and other OUD-related measures, as well as drivers of change of these outcomes in a community. Each community-tailored dashboard is a product of a cocreation process between HCS researchers and stakeholders from each community. The four research sites used a varied set of technical approaches and solutions to support the scientific design and CTH intervention implementation. Ongoing evaluation of the dashboards involves quantitative and qualitative data on key aspects posited to shape dashboard use combined with website analytics. Discussion: The HCS presents an opportunity to advance how community-tailored dashboards can foster community-driven solutions to address the opioid epidemic. Lessons learned can be applied to inform interventions for public health concerns and issues that have disproportionate impact across communities and populations (e.g., racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minorities and other marginalized individuals).

The purpose of this study is to develop the Computerized Model of Performance-Based Measurement system based on the Clinical Reasoning Model. The system can evaluate and identify learning needs for clinical competency and be used as a learning tool to increase clinical competency by using computers. The system includes 10 high-risk, high-volume clinical case scenarios coupled with questions testing clinical reasoning, interpersonal, and technical skills. Questions were sequenced to reflect patients' changing condition and arranged by following the process of collecting and managing information, diagnosing and differentiating urgency of problems, and solving problems. The content validity and known-groups validity was established. The Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 was 0.90 and test-retest reliability was supported (r = 0.78). Nursing educators can use the system to understand students' needs for achieving clinical competence, and therefore, educational plans can be made to better prepare students and facilitate their smooth transition to a future clinical environment. Clinical nurses can use the system to evaluate their performance-based abilities and weakness in clinical reasoning. Appropriate training programs can be designed and implemented to practically promote nurses' clinical competence and quality of patient care.

Thirteen SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers were successfully developed in carnation using an enriched genomic library method. All 13 primer pairs designed could successfully amplify target fragments of the expected size for the original variety 'Francesco' or 'Barbara'. Thirty-nine of 41 carnation varieties, except for mutant varieties, were successfully distinguishable using 32 putative alleles and 15 polymorphic bands produced from 13 SSR markers. 'U Conn Sim' and 'White Sim', which are bud mutants originated from 'William Sim', showed an identical genotype to 'William Sim'. Three (CB026a, C13057a, and CB060a) of 13 SSR markers were thought to be derived from multi-locus because the 3 SSR markers produced more than 3 discrete amplified fragments. The number of allelles per locus ranged from 1 (CB020a and CB041a) to 9 (CB003a), with an average value of 3.2. The values of the observed heterozygosity (H-O) and the expected heterozygosity (H-E.) ranged from 0 to 0.59 (mean 0.30) and 0 to 0.68 (mean 0.34), respectively. The power of discrimination (PD) ranged from 0 (CB020a and CB041a) to 0.93 (CB026a) (mean 0.49). The parentage of 2 carnation varieties from intraspecific crosses was analyzed using 10 SSR markers, and the hybridity of the progenic varieties was confirmed. SSR markers were very effective for variety discrimination and determination of carnation parentage.

Toward a Framework for Public Accountability in Education Reform	EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER			English	Article						accountability; educational policy; educational reform; governance; historical analysis; law; legal; policy analysis	SCHOOL-BASED MANAGEMENT; REPORT CARDS; STATE	Public accountability through information disclosure is a pillar of modern education reform efforts. Despite the ubiquity of this approach, we argue that public accountability in education is undertheorized and often predictably unlikely to achieve its intended policy goals. Drawing on examples from an equity-oriented court case in California and the literatures on democratic engagement and parent use of school performance data, we propose a framework for thinking about the design of public accountability systems in education. The framework could provide guidance for policymakers considering new efforts at improving schools through the production and dissemination of educational data.

We quantified the interaction of medical students with an SoF table while answering a knowledge quiz. Read&Learn tool was used to measure the number of target and non-target table cells visited for each question and the time spent on these cells. Students positively identified target elements for quiz questions and answered simpler questions, but struggled with critical thinking and understanding study outcomes. The question on outcomes with the largest improvement post-intervention had the fewest correct answers, the longest interaction with table cells and the most opened cells before answering. Students spent a median of 72% of the time reading target table cells. A heatmap of the interactions showed that they were mostly answer-oriented. Further development of the tool and metrics is needed to use the tool and the metrics to study the cognitive processes during the assessment of health evidence.

J	Ye, XQ; Liu, D; Li, TR				Ye, Xiaoqing; Liu, Dun; Li, Tianrui			Multi-granularity sequential three-way recommendation based on collaborative deep learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						Granular computing; Sequential three-way decisions; Collaborative filtering; Deep learning	DECISIONS; MODEL	Recommender system (RS) is an information processing system, which mainly utilizes the recommendation information (RI) learned from different data sources to capture user's preference and make recommendation. However, existing recommendation strategies pri-marily focus on the static recommendation strategy, and the multilevel characteristic of RI is ignored. To address the above-mentioned problem, we introduce the idea of granular computing and sequential three-way decisions into RS, and then propose a naive rec-ommendation method with cost-sensitive sequential three-way recommendation (CS3WR) based on collaborative deep learning (CDL). Firstly, inspired by the structure thinking of granular computing, we design a CDL-based joint granulation model to produce the multi-level RI. Subsequently, we propose a CS3WR strategy and an optimal granularity selection mechanism to get the optimal recommendation and optimal granularity, respectively. Fi-nally, extensive experimental results on two CiteUlike datasets validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our methods.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This study examines and compares twenty-first century competencies demonstrated in mother tongue curriculum standards in China, the United States and Finland. It identifies key similarities and significant differences among them. It shows that the Finnish Curriculum has a more balanced distribution of twenty-first century competencies. While communication and critical thinking are stressed in all three, critical thinking is prioritised in the American Curriculum. In addition to communication and critical thinking, the Chinese Curriculum emphasises citizenship based on national identity, metacognitive strategies and aesthetics. The American Curriculum focuses on information and ICT literacy, and the Finnish Curriculum highlights personal and social responsibility concerning cultural awareness and citizenship. The significant differences between these three Curricula are related to the countries' tradition of curriculum theories - the Chinese integrate Western theories and the Confucian tradition, the American follow the Anglo-American curriculum and the Finnish have roots in Bildung-Didaktik. Curriculum objectives should take into consideration both subject knowledge and skills and the student as a whole person. Additionally, different curriculum traditions should be considered and learned during the curriculum design process.

How Media Literacy, Trust of Experts and Flu Vaccine Behaviors Associated with COVID-19 Vaccine Intentions	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH PROMOTION			English	Article; Early Access						COVID-19; media literacy; vaccine; behavior change; intention; flu; critical thinking; knowledge; news; misinformation; disinformation; Indexing Keywords; communication; general medicine; health (social science); infectious diseases; media technology; medicine (miscellaneous); public health; environmental and occupational health	SELF-EFFICACY; KNOWLEDGE	Purpose To assess how previous experiences and new information contributed to COVID-19 vaccine intentions. Design Online survey (N = 1264) with quality checks. Setting Cross-sectional U.S. survey fielded June 22-July 18, 2020. Sample U.S. residents 18+; quotas reflecting U.S. Census, limited to English speakers participating in internet panels. Measures Media literacy for news content and sources, COVID-19 knowledge; perceived usefulness of health experts; if received flu vaccine in past 12 months; vaccine willingness scale; demographics. Analysis Structural equation modelling. Results Perceived usefulness of health experts (b = .422, P < .001) and media literacy (b = .162, P < .003) predicted most variance in vaccine intentions (R-squared=31.5%). A significant interaction (b = .163, P < .001) between knowledge (b = -.132, P = .052) and getting flu shot (b = .185, P < .001) predicted additional 3.5% of the variance in future vaccine intentions. An increase in knowledge of COVID-19 associated with a decrease in vaccine intention among those declining the flu shot. Conclusion The interaction result suggests COVID-19 knowledge had a positive association with vaccine intention for flu shot recipients but a counter-productive association for those declining it. Media literacy and trust in health experts provided strong counterbalancing influences. Survey-based findings are correlational; thus, predictions are based on theory. Future research should study these relationships with panel data or experimental designs.

J	Ngiam, WXQ				Ngiam, William Xiang Quan			Mapping visual working memory models to a theoretical framework	PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW			English	Review; Early Access						Visual working memory; Theory development; Theory map; Model comparison; Definitions	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; CAPACITY LIMITS; NEURAL EVIDENCE; FIXED-CAPACITY; RESOURCES; OBJECTS; ATTENTION; STORAGE; REPRESENTATIONS; INFORMATION	The body of research on visual working memory (VWM)-the system often described as a limited memory store of visual information in service of ongoing tasks-is growing rapidly. The discovery of numerous related phenomena, and the many subtly different definitions of working memory, signify a challenge to maintain a coherent theoretical framework to discuss concepts, compare models and design studies. A lack of robust theory development has been a noteworthy concern in the psychological sciences, thought to be a precursor to the reproducibility crisis (Oberauer & Lewandowsky, PsychonomicBulletin & Review, 26, 1596-1618, 2019). I review the theoretical landscape of the VWM field by examining two prominent debates-whether VWM is object-based or feature-based, and whether discrete-slots or variable-precision best describe VWM limits. I share my concerns about the dualistic nature of these debates and the lack of clear model specification that prevents fully determined empirical tests. In hopes of promoting theory development, I provide a working theory map by using the broadly encompassing memory for latent representations model (Hedayati et al., Nature HumanBehaviour, 6, 5, 2022) as a scaffold for relevant phenomena and current theories. I illustrate how opposing viewpoints can be brought into accordance, situating leading models of VWM to better identify their differences and improve their comparison. The hope is that the theory map will help VWM researchers get on the same page-clarifying hidden intuitions and aligning varying definitions-and become a useful device for meaningful discussions, development of models, and definitive empirical tests of theories.

This overarching research question incorporates a number of points for investigation, including understanding how analysts begin to explore a dataset, the types of grouping/spatial structures created and the operations performed on them, the relationship between grouping and spatial structures, the decisions analysts make when exploring individual observations, and the role of external information. This work contributes the design and results of such a study, in which a group of participants are asked to organize the data contained within an unfamiliar quantitative dataset. We identify several overarching approaches taken by participants to design their organizational space, discuss the interactions performed by the participants, and propose design recommendations to improve the usability of future high-dimensional data exploration tools that make use of grouping (clustering) and spatial (dimension reduction) operations.

The effects of artificial autonomy in intelligent personal assistants	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Internet of Things (IoT); Artificial intelligence; Intelligent personal assistant; Artificial autonomy; Mind perception	UNIVERSAL DIMENSIONS; STEREOTYPE CONTENT; SOCIAL COGNITION; DECISION-MAKING; SERVICE; ADOPTION; COMPETENCE; WARMTH; MODEL; ACCEPTANCE	In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies provide various artificial autonomy features that allow intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) to assist users in managing the dynamically expanding applications, devices, and services in their daily lives. However, limited academic research has been done to validate empirically artificial autonomy and its downstream consequences on human behavior. This study investigates the role of artificial autonomy by dividing it into three types of autonomy in terms of task primitives, namely, sensing, thought, and action autonomy. Drawing on mind perception theory, the authors hypothesize that the two fundamental dimensions of humanlike perceptions-competence and warmth-of non-human entities could explain the mechanism between artificial autonomy and IPA usage. Our results reveal that the comparative effects of competence and warmth perception exist when artificial autonomy contributes to users' continuance usage intention. Theoretically, this study increases our understanding of AI enabled artificial autonomy in information systems research. These findings also provide insightful suggestions for practitioners regarding AI artifacts design.

J	Hartley, J				Hartley, J			What do we know about footnotes? Opinions and data	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article							LIKERT SCALE	Background: There is a scattered literature on various aspects of the design, use and information conveyed by footnotes in academic text that can be considered under the three headings of sociological, psychological and typographical matters. Aims: The aims of this paper are: (i) to review this literature and (ii) to report the results from a small-scale enquiry into academics' attitudes to footnotes and endnotes and their positioning in text. Method: In this enquiry, an eleven-item Likert-type scale was completed by two groups of academics. Group 1 (N = 52) typically reads journal articles with footnotes and Group 2 (N = 57) typically reads articles without them. Results: The result suggested that, despite wide variations, there were commonalties between these two groups of academics. Most people in both groups were positive towards footnotes and many thought that they could be easily ignored. In addition, most readers preferred footnotes, endnotes and references to be at the ends of the chapters to which they referred, rather than at the end of the book.

It is a revolutionary leap in the research of geoscience knowledge discovery from the traditional encyclopedic discipline knowledge system to the computer-understandable and operable knowledge graph. Based on adopting the graph pattern of general knowledge representation, the geoscience knowledge graph expands the unique spatiotemporal features to the Geoscience knowledge, and integrates geoscience knowledge elements such as map, text, number, to establish an all-domain geoscience knowledge representation model. A federated, crowd intelligence-based collaborative method of constructing the geoscience knowledge graph is developed here, which realizes the construction of high-quality professional knowledge graph in collaboration with global geoscientists. We also develop a method for constructing a dynamic knowledge graph of multi-modal geoscience data based on in-depth text analysis, which extracts geoscience knowledge from massive geoscience literature to construct the latest and most complete dynamic geoscience knowledge graph. A comprehensive and systematic geoscience knowledge graph can not only deepen the existing geoscience big data analysis, but also advance the construction of the high-precision geological time scale driven by big data, the compilation of intelligent maps driven by rules and data, and the geoscience knowledge evolution and reasoning analysis, and others. It will further expand the new directions of geoscience research driven by both data and knowledge, break new ground where geoscience, information science, and data science intersect, and realize the original innovation of the geoscience research and achieve major theoretical breakthroughs in the spatiotemporal big data research.

Situativity theory: A perspective on how participants and the environment can interact: AMEE Guide no. 52	MEDICAL TEACHER			English	Article							INSTRUCTIONAL-DESIGN; COGNITION; CONTEXT; MODELS	Situativity theory refers to theoretical frameworks which argue that knowledge, thinking, and learning are situated (or located) in experience. The importance of context to these theories is paramount, including the unique contribution of the environment to knowledge, thinking, and learning; indeed, they argue that knowledge, thinking, and learning cannot be separated from (they are dependent upon) context. Situativity theory includes situated cognition, situated learning, ecological psychology, and distributed cognition. In this Guide, we first outline key tenets of situativity theory and then compare situativity theory to information processing theory; we suspect that the reader may be quite familiar with the latter, which has prevailed in medical education research. Contrasting situativity theory with information processing theory also serves to highlight some unique potential contributions of situativity theory to work in medical education. Further, we discuss each of these situativity theories and then relate the theories to the clinical context. Examples and illustrations for each of the theories are used throughout. We will conclude with some potential considerations for future exploration. Some implications of situativity theory include: a new way of approaching knowledge and how experience and the environment impact knowledge, thinking, and learning; recognizing that the situativity framework can be a useful tool to ""diagnose"" the teaching or clinical event; the notion that increasing individual responsibility and participation in a community (i.e., increasing ""belonging"") is essential to learning; understanding that the teaching and clinical environment can be complex (i.e., non-linear and multi-level); recognizing that explicit attention to how participants in a group interact with each other (not only with the teacher) and how the associated learning artifacts, such as computers, can meaningfully impact learning.</.

The decline in the synaptic density of neuronal networks is one of the most important characteristics of brain development, which is closely related to synaptic pruning, synaptic growth, synaptic plasticity, and energy metabolism. However, because of technical limitations in observing large-scale neuronal networks dynamically connected through synapses, how neuronal networks are organized and evolve as their synaptic density declines remains unclear. Here, by establishing a biologically reasonable neuronal network model, we show that despite a decline in the synaptic density, the connectivity, and efficiency of neuronal networks can be improved. Importantly, by analyzing the degree distribution, we also find that both the scale-free characteristic of neuronal networks and the emergence of hub neurons rely on the spatial distance between neurons. These findings may promote our understanding of neuronal networks in the brain and have guiding significance for the design of neuronal network models.

Accordingly, an instant perspective comparison system (IPCS) based on natural language processing, social networks, and data visualization technologies was developed in this study to present the similarity and differences in terms of the multiple perspectives and complexity of both learning peers through visualizing perspective comparison diagram to facilitate the depth and width of learners' thinking in a discussion process for promoting the online discussion effectiveness. With a quasi-experimental design, a total of 49 Grade 11 students from two classes in a senior high school of Taipei City in Taiwan were randomly recruited as the research subjects for the online discussion activity about the socio-scientific issues (SSI) titled "nuclear power generation." A total of 28 students from a class were randomly assigned as the experimental group with an IPCS-assisted online discussion, while a total of 21 students from another class were randomly assigned as the control group with a general online discussion to examine the differences in discussion effectiveness of learners between the two groups. Furthermore, prior computer-mediated communication (CMC) competence was considered as a background variable to discuss the difference in the discussion effectiveness of learners between the two groups. The research results show that, in comparison with a general online discussion, an IPCS-assisted online discussion could significantly facilitate learners' overall discussion effectiveness, particularly for the sub-dimension of multiple perspectives. Especially, the IPCS could promote the overall discussion effectiveness and sub-dimension of the complexity of learners with low CMC competence to more deeply comprehend and understand the discussion issue than those of learners with high CMC competence. In conclusion, the IPCS developed in this study is an innovative and effective online discussion assisted tool. It would bring the development of online discussion tool into new ground.

J	Harms, IM				Harms, Ilse M.			Distracted by familiarity: Implications of 'autopilot' as a default cognitive mode	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						Everyday driving; Route familiarity; Skilled behaviour; Automaticity; Distraction	DRIVER DISTRACTION; TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT; ATTENTION; BEHAVIOR; SPEED; SIGNS; INATTENTION; TIME; AUTOMATICITY; INFORMATION	Most trips are made, and most travel is done on roads and paths well-known. To provide insight in the cognitive processes involved in visual information processing of familiar traffic environments this paper considers a series of four consecutive empirical studies. The aim of this paper is 1) to discuss the implications of these insights on research methodologies used to measure driver attention and distraction and 2) to provide recommendations for policymaking, road design and vehicle design. This line of work consists of three studies on car driver behaviour (two driving simulator studies and a video-based study) and an observational study on pedestrian behaviour. The recurring theme in the results of these studies is that the progressive exposure to the same traffic environment enables participants to automatise their behavioural performance in traffic up to the point that it could be executed at skill-based level. As a result, attention is easily diverted away from traffic participation, while participating in traffic. Participants could act without thinking about it, so they didn't always even remember what they had done. People get used to familiar traffic environments so much that they don't have to think about walking or driving with much conscious focus. Hence, when studying road user behaviour and particularly driver distraction, it is crucial to mimic these natural circumstances as closely as possible. It is therefore proposed that within driver distraction research, route familiarity should be regarded as a context that enables distraction. What is more, is that the results point in the direction of a familiarity paradox: deviating from what is very familiar likely results in involuntary distraction, but being very familiar may lead to underload resulting in (voluntarily) diverting attention elsewhere.

Design/methodology/approach - A three-month TRIZ educational program was run. Three standard questionnaires were used for assessing creative thinking (CT), need for cognition (NFC) and interest in work innovation (IWI). From different scientific sectors of aerospace industries, 290 participants took part in completing pre- and post-test questionnaires. The collected data were analyzed by the related statistical methods (the sign test, correlation analysis and descriptive statistics). Findings - The results indicate that the TRIZ training workshop directly enhanced CT, NFC and IWI scores, and that there is a statistically significant positive correlation between these characteristics. Also, the results of the correlation analysis of these variables and the demographic features of the participants shed light on interesting facts that can be used for decision makers and researchers of aerospace industries. Research limitations/implications - This study opens a new way for further research in the analysis of the impact of problem-solving techniques on improving creativity and innovation in aerospace and other high-tech industries. Originality/value - This paper may be of high value to researchers in creativity and innovation fields in the high-tech industries, including the aerospace industry. This study further facilitates decision-making by enhancing inventive problem solving in these industries. It gives valuable information and guidelines that hopefully will help managers to consider the important issues during TRIZ toolkit establishment in their organizations.

A socio-emotional analysis of technology use by people with intellectual disabilities	JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY RESEARCH			English	Article						Ahmed; digital inclusion; emotions; information and communication technologies; learning disability; post-qualitative	INCLUSION; INTERNET; ADULTS; LIFE; IDENTITY; RISKS; ICT	Background Access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) is often thought to enhance the lives of people with intellectual disabilities (ID) and is considered an important aspect of digital inclusion. However, inclusion practices often fail to address societal inequalities that lead to and sustain exclusion. The aim of this research was to enhance understandings of the relationships people with ID form with technology by critically analysing the underlying assumptions of inclusion practices. Method We employed a post-qualitative approach to reanalyse previously collected data from face-to-face interviews with 10 Australian adults with ID who attended a community literacy programme about their technology use in their daily lives. Two of social theorist Sara Ahmed's key concepts were used to analyse these data: (1) 'stickiness' of emotions, where certain (socially dominant) emotions are considered to attach to objects over time (e.g. mobile phone use is normal/good) and (2) 'fit' between people and objects, where there is a sense of comfort when objects are designed for people like you - those outside the 'norm' experience discomfort and a sense of being 'othered' in their interactions with such objects which do not fit them. Results Our analysis identified how people with ID often attributed positive feelings to technology even when they had seemingly negative interactions with their devices (e.g. they could not use certain features, caregivers acted as gatekeepers to access). The positive associations were likely the outcome of implicitly held understandings that society highly values technology (Ahmed's stickiness of emotions). Although some participants accessed technology without difficulty, others experienced discomfort due to difficulties using devices that were not designed for them (Ahmed's fit between people and objects). Importantly, some participants had access to technology and the technical skill to use ICTs, but other factors, such as not having many friends, impacted their ability to use their devices in meaningful ways. Conclusion Our analysis suggests that digital inclusion practices focused on providing access to technology may unintentionally harm in ways that are not immediately apparent when working with people with ID. Harms might include further marginalisation or 'othering' of people with ID. It is important to recognise that well-meaning attempts to encourage use of ICTs may be counterproductive if they lead to experiences of marginalisation. To avoid this, inclusion practices could focus beyond access to devices, and the ability to use them, to include considerations of the multiple socio-emotional effects. What is a good fit is not entirely predeterminable, exploration of the possibilities for what will work well for any individual requires experimentation and creativity, and a careful attention to unintended effects. Beyond this, the development of new technology should consider how to diversify devices that often fail to fit people with disabilities.

J	Tambo, T; Filtenborg, J				Tambo, Torben; Filtenborg, Jacob			Digital services governance: IT4IT™ for management of technology	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						IT4IT; IT service management; Management of technology; Digital business creation; SIAM	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; FRAMEWORK; ORGANIZATIONS; PERSPECTIVE; INNOVATION; DESIGN; MODELS; ISSUE; COST	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present, analyse and demonstrate the impact and potentials of a pragmatically derived information technology (IT) governance framework, IT4IT (TM), for the discipline of management of technology (MoT) especially within the IT industry. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on an extensive literature study working with the limitations of the relatively recent publication of IT4IT (TM) and the normative character of IT4IT (TM). A mixed-method case study is presented based on an IT service provider organisation. Both a qualitative method and a systems and design oriented method are being used. Findings IT4IT (TM) can provide value and a clearer understanding of the service delivery framework if the technological core of the focal organisation is adapted to a value stream thinking. This suggests a more operational character of all IT processes and analogue to general MoT frameworks and corporate governance models. Research limitations/implications - Given the recent publication of the IT4ITT framework, this study is primarily ex ante and suggests further full-scale ex post research in the future. Practical implications - Validation and successful implementation of the IT4ITT framework will give companies better opportunities for safe and controlled value creation using IT. Control connects with risk reduction and less risk can encourage innovation and "tame" development complexity. Using value streams will align IT better with manufacturing and services. Originality/value Companies are striving to seek governance and risk minimisation in IT development and operations. This paper is discussing the applicability of the IT4IT (TM) framework for finding a better understanding of the value creation and value proposition delivered by introducing controlled processes minimising risk.

Osteoconductive Microarchitecture of Bone Substitutes for Bone Regeneration Revisited	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						osteoconduction; pore; bone substitute material; additive manufacturing; lithography; micro architecture; bone regeneration; scaffold	CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE CERAMICS; TITANIUM IMPLANTS; PORE-SIZE; IN-VITRO; TISSUE; SCAFFOLDS; CELLS; HYDROXYAPATITE	In the last three decades, all efforts in bone tissue engineering were driven by the dogma that the ideal pore size in bone substitutes lies between 0.3 and 0.5 mm in diameter. Newly developed additive manufacturing methodologies for ceramics facilitate the total control over pore size, pore distribution, bottleneck size, and bottleneck distribution. Therefore, this appears to be the method of choice with which to test the aforementioned characteristics of an ideal bone substitute. To this end, we produced a library of 15 scaffolds with diverse defined pore/bottleneck dimensions and distributions, tested them in vivo in a calvarial bone defect model in rabbits, and assessed the clinically most relevant parameters: defect bridging and bony regenerated area. Our in vivo data revealed that the ideal pore/bottleneck dimension for bone substitutes is in the range of 0.7-1.2 mm, and appears therefore to be twofold to fourfold more extended than previously thought. Pore/bottleneck dimensions of 1.5 and 1.7 mm perform significantly worse and appear unsuitable in bone substitutes. Thus, our results set the ideal range of pore/bottleneck dimensions and are likely to have a significant impact on the microarchitectural design of future bone substitutes for use in orthopedic, trauma, cranio-maxillofacial and oral surgery.

Progeny vRNAs replicated in the nucleus selectively assemble into a single set of eight different segments, probably in the cytoplasm, and are packaged into progeny virions at the cell membrane. In these processes, a region of approximately 100 nucleotides at both ends of each segment is thought to function as a selective assembly/packaging signal; however, the details of the mechanism, such as the required sequences, are still unknown. In this study, we focused on the 5 '-terminus of the sixth neuraminidase gene segment vRNA (Seg.6) to identify the essential sequence for selective packaging. The 5 '-terminal region of the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 strain Seg.6 was divided into seven regions of 15 nucleotides each from A to G, and mutations were introduced into each region by complementary base substitutions or synonymous codon substitutions. Mutant viruses were generated and compared for infectious titers, and the relative ratios of the eight segments packaged into virions were measured. We also ascertained whether mutant vRNA was eliminated by competitive packaging with wild-type vRNA. Mutations in the A-C regions reduced infectious titers and eliminated mutant vRNAs by competition with wild-type vRNA. Even under non-competitive conditions, the packaging efficiency of the A or B region mutant Seg.6 was reduced. Next, we designed an artificial vRNA with a 50-nucleotide duplication at the 5 '-terminal region. Using this, a virus library was created by randomly replacing each region, which became an untranslated region (UTR), with complementary bases. After selecting proliferative viruses from the library, nine wild-type nucleotides in the A and B regions were identified as essential bases, and we found that these bases were highly conserved in Seg.6 vRNAs encoding the N1 subtype neuraminidase. From these results, we conclude that the identified bases function as the 5 '-terminal packaging signal for the N1 subtype Seg.6 vRNA.

Decision aids (DAs) offer a promising method of helping them make this decision. But concern lingers that DAs might introduce cognitive biases. Methods: We recruited 663 women at high risk of breast cancer and presented them with a DA designed to experimentally test potential methods of identifying and reducing cognitive biases that could influence this decision, by varying specific aspects of the DA across participants in a factorial design. Results: Participants were susceptible to a cognitive bias - an order effect - such that those who learned first about the risks of tamoxifen thought more favorably of the drug than women who learned first about the benefits. This order effect was eliminated among women who received additional information about competing health risks. Conclusion: We discovered that the order of risk/benefit information influenced women's perceptions of tamoxifen. This bias was eliminated by providing contextual information about competing health risks. Practice implications: We have demonstrated the feasibility of using factorial experimental designs to test whether DAs introduce cognitive biases, and whether specific elements of DAs can reduce such biases.

There are no standardized protocols for gathering user requirements beyond clinical/diagnostic information relating to AAC access needs (i.e., physical and cognitive capabilities). Nonetheless, information on the social, cultural, and psychological aspects of technology orientation and use are important to understanding how an AAC system will complement the user's lifestyle, personal goals, values, and activities. Persona development is a user-centered design method that creates descriptive user models of different segments of a user population. Personas describe users' personal characteristics, and the ways in which they think, behave, and engage in activities (with or without technology). The objective of this study is to investigate the utility of user personas as a supplementary tool to aid SLPs in AAC assessment and service delivery. Three personas of individuals with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) were developed and validated in our prior research. Twelve SLPs engaged in mock AAC assessments of the three ALS case studies under two conditions: with or without the use of personas as a supplemental informational tool. By and large, there were no statistically significant differences between groups across objective measures; however, interview sessions with the SLP participants revealed benefits to using personas during clinical decision-making, particularly for training novice SLPs. Discussion also focuses on ways in which user personas can be adapted and improved to mitigate some of the challenges and risks identified.

Recently, face alignment is deemed as a regression problem, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are utilized to predict the coordinates of facial landmarks. However, most existing methods only adopt Euclidean loss as the optimization target for each landmark, and neglect the correlations between them, which we think may be inappropriate. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a novel Relative Coordinates Constraint (RCC) loss function for face alignment, which considers the relative coordinates between any pairs of landmarks as a new supervision signal. More importantly, we prove that the proposed RCC loss function is trainable and can be easily incorporated in existing CNNs optimization procedure. With the joint supervision of Euclidean loss and RCC loss, we train a robust and light CNNs framework for face alignment. Extensive experimental results on several datasets show that the precision of face alignment improved significantly by the proposed RCC loss and quantitative results are comparable to state-of-the-art methods (mean error 5.39 on 300-W and 6.99 on AFLW). In addition, the proposed framework is also an efficient solution (300 FPS on CPU). We share the implementation code of our proposed methods at https://github.com/nianfudong/RCC-loss.

A similar approach is used in group KJ method sessions; however, the effectiveness of capturing and sharing the diagrams and information is limited because of the large amount of paper required. Considering the merits of the conventional paper-pen approach and the demand for quick sharing of diagrams after a session, we designed and implemented a system to digitize group KJ sessions-not just the diagrams but also the details of the creative process. We used digital pens during the session to capture the position and orientation of labels as well as their content. We confirmed the efficiency of our system by applying it to several GKJ sessions.

Our earlier research initiated the adoption of Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) to derive a model, that specifies strategic drivers for guiding alignment of healthcare and IT practices in IMM. However, the model does not directly reveal details of how a programme can implement and continuously assess specific healthcare and IT practices in a coherent/integrated way, so as to realize goals and outcomes of IMM. This implies the need to extend the model by providing a mechanism that synchronizes specific elements of healthcare and IT practices, with the strategic goals of delivering integrated care for multimorbid patients. Such a synthesis of best practices in IMM, can serve as Scorecard for Continuous Assessment and improvement of programmes on Integrated Care for multimorbid patients (SAICO). To design SAICO, SSM's multi-level thinking technique was mutually adopted with Co-Creation, Enterprise Architecture, and Balanced Scorecard approaches. SAICO's design was enhanced using a Co-Creation by validation approach, that involved 18 co-creators or subject matter experts from Spain and Uganda. Findings from SAICO evaluation affirmed its usefulness and provided insights that improved its design, understandability, and usability. SAICO can be perceived as an evolving reference map of elements/capabilities that shape a programme's capacity for IMM, because it can be used to conduct continuous self assessment and identify actions for improvement.

To develop, implement, and assess an Internet-based vidcasting project to promote the pharmacist's role in public health. Design. This was a collaborative effort for 2 different courses taught at 2 different schools of pharmacy. Faculty members created a special instructional design for students to follow in planning, producing, and publishing video public service announcements on the Internet. Assessment. Formative and summative assessments, including course examinations, a grading rubric, student survey, and focus group, were implemented to evaluate student learning and public reaction. Students believed Internet video public service announcements served as a useful reference for patients and professionals, aided in promoting disease prevention and wellness initiatives, positively impacted patient-provider relationships, and increased awareness regarding significance and financial impact of disease burden. Conclusion. Producing a public health information video and vidcasting it on the Internet increased pharmacy students' self-esteem, respect for peers, creative and critical-thinking abilities, and understanding of the need for and importance of pharmacists providing accurate public health information.

J	Wang, C; Guo, N; Lian, MH; Xiao, XH				Wang, Chao; Guo, Na; Lian, Menghe; Xiao, Xiaohong			Differences in Regional Media Responses to China's Holistic Tourism: Big Data Analysis Based on Newspaper Text	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Media; Indexes; Big Data; Economics; Focusing; Finance; Industries; Big data; holistic tourism; media response; response index; text mining		Holistic tourism is an important strategy to promote tourism development and has been widely concerned by the academic community. Newspaper media is an important thought output port of the local government. Newspaper media reports can reflect each regional response to the holistic tourism strategy to a certain extent. By investigating newspaper text using big data analysis, the differences in regional media responses to holistic tourism provide new research perspectives for scholars in the fields of global information, big data, and tourism. These differences also provide reference for policymakers in measuring the response of international media reports. Based on the full-text database of China National Knowledge Infrastructure newspaper, this study analyzes the situation of "holistic tourism" reported by different regional newspapers in China using content analysis and bibliometrics. From the perspectives of three dimensions of attention, importance, and focusing degrees, the coverage time of newspaper media in the eastern and the central regions of China is earlier than that in the western China. However, the newspaper media reports have increased in the western region after some years. From the media response index, China's holistic tourism media response area has been increasing annually and rapidly expanding to 31 provinces in Mainland China, showing the characteristics of the east central part of the country being higher than the west. By designing the concept of media response index, this study provides a new research perspective for scholars from different fields and enriches the measurement and the theoretical systems of media response.

Decoding study-independent mind-wandering from EEG using convolutional neural networks	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; convolutional neural network; mind-wandering; generalizability; meta-learner; classifier; machine learning	CONTINUOUS WAVELET TRANSFORM; AWARENESS; THOUGHT; BRAIN; MODEL	Objective. Mind-wandering is a mental phenomenon where the internal thought process disengages from the external environment periodically. In the current study, we trained EEG classifiers using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to track mind-wandering across studies. Approach. We transformed the input from raw EEG to band-frequency information (power), single-trial ERP (stERP) patterns, and connectivity matrices between channels (based on inter-site phase clustering). We trained CNN models for each input type from each EEG channel as the input model for the meta-learner. To verify the generalizability, we used leave-N-participant-out cross-validations (N = 6) and tested the meta-learner on the data from an independent study for across-study predictions. Main results. The current results show limited generalizability across participants and tasks. Nevertheless, our meta-learner trained with the stERPs performed the best among the state-of-the-art neural networks. The mapping of each input model to the output of the meta-learner indicates the importance of each EEG channel. Significance. Our study makes the first attempt to train study-independent mind-wandering classifiers. The results indicate that this remains challenging. The stacking neural network design we used allows an easy inspection of channel importance and feature maps.

However, with continuing increases in fish consumption advisories due to the contamination of our environment, anglers have to decide whether or not to eat the fish they catch. The Clinch River arm of Watts Bar Reservoir is under a fish consumption advisory because of elevated PCB concentrations in striped bass (Morone saxatilis), catfish (Ictalurus spp.) and sauger (Stizostedion canadense) due in part from contaminants released from the US Department of Energy's (USDOE's) Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) in East Tennessee. To obtain information about the demographics, fishing behavior, knowledge, fish consumption and risk perception of anglers, a survey was conducted of 202 people actively fishing either on land or by boat along the Clinch River arm of Watts Bar Reservoir adjacent to the ORR from Melton Hill Dam to the Poplar Creek confluence, or on Poplar Creek within ORR boundaries from mid-March to early November 2001. Even though 81% of people interviewed knew about the fish consumption advisories for the study area, 48% of them thought the fish were safe to eat, while 38% ate the fish that they caught from the study area. Approximately 36% of anglers who had knowledge of the fish consumption warnings ate fish from the study area. Providing confirmation that people fish for many reasons, 35% of anglers interviewed did not eat fish at all. The majority of anglers interviewed knew about the fish consumption advisories because of the signs posted throughout the study area. However, few people knew the correct fish advisories. Significantly fewer blacks had knowledge of the fish consumption warnings than whites. Information resulting from this study could be used to design a program with the objective of reaching the people who may be most at risk from eating fish caught from the Clinch River arm of Watts Bar Reservoir.

Perceptions about their risk and other factors are thought to influence individuals' decisions to take protective actions for hurricanes. This research investigates the perceptions, behavioral intentions, and actual protective actions of a sample of residents in Miami-Dade County, Florida. We use unique data collected via a telephone survey to investigate a set of factors including risk perception, perceived local government readiness for a hurricane, past hurricane experience, hazard information exposure, and demographics, which have been posited to influence perceived hurricane preparedness, intent to evacuate under hurricane threat, and actual hurricane preparedness. The analytic results show that risk perception was positively associated with perceived preparedness, intent to evacuate, and one of the actual preparedness measures. Perceived local government readiness for a hurricane also was positively related to perceived preparedness and an actual protective measure. The results for other factors, including socio-demographics, varied by dependent variable. Following a report of the results, we discuss the research and policy implications of our findings.

If it doesn't work, then can take start taking the medication given by the doctors." Patients' perceptions towards hypertension in Fiji	PLOS ONE			English	Article							QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; VALIDITY; RIGOR	BackgroundHypertension remains a public health challenge worldwide however, the prevention, detection, treatment and management of this condition are not highly prioritized. Health knowledge has an important impact on individual's health. The ability to actively participate in screening, diagnosis and management of hypertension are influenced by patient's knowledge of hypertension. To understand why hypertension is so difficult to control, it may be of benefit to gain an understanding of the patient's perspective. Hence, the aim of the study is to explore the perceptions of patients on prevention and diagnosis of hypertension in Fiji.MethodsThe study used a qualitative method approach. The study was conducted at the four purposively selected health centers in the Lautoka/ Yasawa medical subdivision. A purposive sampling was used which included all the patients who attended the SOPD, age more than 18 years and above, diagnosed with hypertension for 6 months or more and attended clinic at one of the 4 selected health centers. Semi-structured open-ended interview guide were used to collect data among patients through in-depth interviews. Thematic analysis was used manually to analyze the data using four steps that is immersion in the data, coding the data, creating categories and identifying themes / subthemes.ResultsTwenty-five SOPD patients took part in the in-depth interview and the responses were grouped into two themes. The themes emerged included hypertension knowledge and diagnosis of hypertension in a closed family and self. Subthemes derived from the hypertension knowledge were measures of awareness, hypertension aetiology, risk perception, origin of information and concept of prevention. Sub themes derived from the diagnosis of hypertension in a closed family were perception when first diagnosed, hypertension in relation and hypertension impact. Patients' knowledge on etiologies and risk factors of hypertension were generally poor. Majority of the participants learnt about hypertension in hospitals and few over radios and television. Diagnosis in a closed family triggered worrisome, fear and fright on some patients.ConclusionMajority of the patients have less knowledge about various risk factors of hypertension. Worrisome, fearful, frightful, frustration and sadness were some of the reactions and emotions highlighted by the patients. It is important to design culturally tailored interventions that address the psychological and behavioral needs of the patients. Recommendation to conduct further studies to understand the perception of hypertension among the general public.

We have developed a theoretical framework to generate a ZTC model from any given zeolite structure, which we show can successfully predict the structure of known ZTCs. We use our method to generate a library of ZTCs from all known zeolites, to establish criteria for which zeolites can produce experimentally accessible ZTCs, and to identify over 10 ZTCs that have never before been synthesized. We show that ZTCs partition space into two disjoint labyrinths that can be described by a pair of interpenetrating nets. Since such a pair of nets also describes a triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS), our results establish the relationship between ZTCs and schwarzites-carbon materials with negative Gaussian curvature that resemble TPMSs-linking the research topics and demonstrating that schwarzites should no longer be thought of as purely hypothetical materials.

Computer-Assisted Keyword and Document Set Discovery from Unstructured Text	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; CLASSIFICATION; COVERAGE; MEDIA	The (unheralded) first step in many applications of automated text analysis involves selecting keywords to choose documents from a large text corpus for further study. Although all substantive results depend on this choice, researchers usually pick keywords in ad hoc ways that are far from optimal and usually biased. Most seem to think that keyword selection is easy, since they do Google searches every day, but we demonstrate that humans perform exceedingly poorly at this basic task. We offer a better approach, one that also can help with following conversations where participants rapidly innovate language to evade authorities, seek political advantage, or express creativity; generic web searching; eDiscovery; look-alike modeling; industry and intelligence analysis; and sentiment and topic analysis. We develop a computer-assisted (as opposed to fully automated or human-only) statistical approach that suggests keywords from available text without needing structured data as inputs. This framing poses the statistical problem in a new way, which leads to a widely applicable algorithm. Our specific approach is based on training classifiers, extracting information from (rather than correcting) their mistakes, and summarizing results with easy-to-understand Boolean search strings. We illustrate how the technique works with analyses of English texts about the Boston Marathon bombings, Chinese social media posts designed to evade censorship, and others.

Besides solving an MPG in the usual sense, our algorithm computes more information about the game, information that is important with respect to applications. The weights of the edges of an MPG can be thought of as a gained/consumed energy - depending on the sign. For each vertex, our algorithm computes the minimum amount of initial energy that is sufficient for player Max to ensure that in a play starting from the vertex, the energy level never goes below zero. Our algorithm is not the first algorithm that computes the minimum sufficient initial energies, but according to our experimental study it is the fastest algorithm that computes them. The reason is that it utilizes the strategy improvement technique which is very efficient in practice.

Using Guiding Questions to Promote Scientific Practices in Undergraduate Chemistry Laboratories	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						First-Year Undergraduate; General; Upper-Division Undergraduate; Laboratory Instruction; Communication; Writing; Inquiry-Based; Discovery Learning; Problem Solving; Decision Making	ARGUMENT-DRIVEN INQUIRY; STUDENTS CRITICAL THINKING; SCIENCE; SKILLS; CHALLENGES; KNOWLEDGE; FACULTY; LEARN; TOOL	Engaging students in scientific practices has become an important pedagogical component in STEM education, although its implementation in laboratories is still emerging. This paper uses three types of guiding questions to facilitate scientific practices in introductory and analytical chemistry laboratories. What makes our instructional model different from other developments is that certain types of scientific practices can be promoted by incorporating guiding questions into traditional laboratories, namely, type I prelaboratory questions for experimental design and implementation, type II postlaboratory guiding questions for knowledge construction, and type III postlaboratory guiding questions for experimental error analysis. Answers to these guiding questions were assessed for students' correct chemical knowledge and procedure design (type I) and for their presentation of the three key components of an argument: evidence, justifications, and claims (types II and III). A significant improvement in student score on types II and III questions and a modest upgrading on type I questions were observed as students progressed through Introductory Chemistry Laboratories to Analytical Chemistry Lab. Type I prelaboratory guiding questions incorporate a higher level of inquiry than types II and III postlaboratory guiding questions, thus more practices are needed to master advanced skills. Student performance on guiding questions improved throughout the semester in analytical chemistry laboratories. Students rated their experiences and helpfulness of guiding questions positively. This instructional model can be adopted in other science laboratories for setting up explicit goals and prioritizing useful information without changing the structure of curricula.

J	Button, J; Turner, DP; Hammer, D				Button, John; Pamuk Turner, Diren; Hammer, David			How chemists handle not-knowing in reasoning about a novel problem	CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article							EXPERT; STUDENTS; SCIENCE; EDUCATION; UNCERTAINTY; PERFORMANCE; KNOWLEDGE; DESIGN; MANGLE; THINK	The most obvious feature of expertise in chemistry is content knowledge, which defines the primary objectives of instruction. Research in chemistry education, and STEM education more broadly, has also devoted attention to students' developing scientific practices of reasoning, investigation, and learning. In this study, we set out to investigate how expert chemists reason about an unfamiliar question. We conducted semi-structured, think-aloud interviews with fourteen chemists, all of whom found the problem novel. In this article, we focus on how the chemists handled the situation of not-knowing. We analyzed the moments when they said "I don't know" (IDK), taking that as a clear, systematic marker of their not-knowing. The results elucidate two general dimensions of the chemists' reasoning and experience. First, their identifying what they do not know served substantive roles in their reasoning, including to mark that they needed to search for insight or information, or to mark a boundary to the problem space. Second, IDK statements served to help the chemists manage what they experienced socially and emotionally, such as to hedge or distance themselves from ideas they considered, or to forestall their own-or the interviewer's-negative judgments. We discuss both aspects of our findings, and we consider possible implications for instruction and for further research.

The characterization and analysis of such inhomogeneous index profiles pose several degrees of challenges to thin-film researchers depending upon the availability of relevant experimental and process-monitoring-related information. In the present work, a variety of novel experimental non-linear index profiles have been observed in thin films of MgOAl2O3ZrO2 ternary composites in solid solution under various electron-beam deposition parameters. Analysis and derivation of these non-linear spectral index profiles have been carried out by an inverse-synthesis approach using a real-time optical monitoring signal and post-deposition transmittance and reflection spectra. Most of the non-linear index functions are observed to fit polynomial equations of order seven or eight very well. In this paper, the application of such a non-linear index function has also been demonstrated in designing electric-field-optimized high-damage-threshold multilayer coatings such as normal- and oblique-incidence edge filters and a broadband beam splitter for p-polarized light. Such designs can also advantageously maintain the microstructural stability of the multilayer structure due to the low stress factor of the non-linear ternary composite layers.

J	WOODDAUPHINEE, S				WOODDAUPHINEE, S			BRINGING SURGICAL REALITY TO QUALITY-OF-LIFE ASSESSMENT	THEORETICAL SURGERY			English	Review						QUALITY OF LIFE; SURGICAL PRACTICE; SURGICAL RESEARCH		To maximize the art and science of quality-of-life assessment, it is essential that caregivers, clinical researchers and methodologists work together. This coordinated effort demands that these types of individuals understand the generalities of each other's disciplines. The sessions during the Consensus Conference on Issues, Problems and Solutions in Quality-of-Life Assessment in Surgery were designed to help methodologists understand how surgeons were thinking about quality-of-life issues on a day-to-day basis. In this paper the presentations are reviewed and the trends across the surgical specialties outlined. Despite the general acknowledgement that evaluation of the effects of disease and treatment on the quality of patients' lives is important, extensive diversity exists in terms of the status and actual use of quality-of-life assessment. When undertaken, most authors concur that physical, emotional and social domains should be included, that standardized measures should be employed and that disease-specific instruments provide more information of value to clinicians. There is a growing idea that in addition to the quality of life of the patient, perhaps that of the family should also be assessed. These sessions emphasized what has been accomplished to date in quality-of-life assessment in surgery and pointed out directions to be followed in the future.

J	Ormerod, R				Ormerod, R			Putting soft OR methods to work: The case of the business improvement project at PowerGen	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						process of OR; systems; business process redesign; benchmarking; energy	SYSTEMS STRATEGY-DEVELOPMENT; OPERATIONAL-RESEARCH; SAINSBURYS; FUTURE; VSM	In 1994 PowerGen, a UK electricity generating company, conducted a business improvement project. The project used a participative approach involving soft OR and systems thinking, an approach that was developed in earlier projects in food retailing and mining. The aim of the project was initially to conduct a benchmarking exercise and develop an information systems (IS) strategy. As the project progressed the emphasis moved to business process redesign and downsizing in the light of new perceptions of business prospects. The paper describes the design and implementation of the intervention, the evolution of the project, the problems encountered, and the outcome. Throughout it describes in some detail the interaction that took place. Although many improvements to current operations were identified for implementation, it proved difficult to obtain agreement to a fundamental change in the organisational structure. Two years after the project finished a new organisation based on the project's analysis has been adopted. The case is discussed drawing on a number of recent theoretical themes that have emerged from the debate about the process of OR. Conclusions are drawn about the value of the methods used in the intervention, the practicalities of mixing several methods, and the future direction the research programme should take.

J	Davidoff, F; Batalden, P				Davidoff, F; Batalden, P			Toward stronger evidence on quality improvement. Draft publication guidelines: the beginning of a consensus project	QUALITY & SAFETY IN HEALTH CARE			English	Article							RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; MEDICAL STATISTICS	In contrast with the primary goals of science, which are to discover and disseminate new knowledge, the primary goal of improvement is to change performance. Unfortunately, scholarly accounts of the methods, experiences, and results of most medical quality improvement work are not published, either in print or electronic form. In our view this failure to publish is a serious deficiency: it limits the available evidence on efficacy, prevents critical scrutiny, deprives staff of the opportunity and incentive to clarify thinking, slows dissemination of established improvements, inhibits discovery of innovations, and compromises the ethical obligation to return valuable information to the public. The reasons for this failure are many: competing service responsibilities of and lack of academic rewards for improvement staff; editors' and peer reviewers' unfamiliarity with improvement goals and methods; and lack of publication guidelines that are appropriate for rigorous, scholarly improvement work. We propose here a draft set of guidelines designed to help with writing, reviewing, editing, interpreting, and using such reports. We envisage this draft as the starting point for collaborative development of more definitive guidelines. We suggest that medical quality improvement will not reach its full potential unless accurate and transparent reports of improvement work are published frequently and widely.

A Practical Approach to Evidence-Based Medicine for the Medical Communications Professional	DRUG INFORMATION JOURNAL			English	Article						Medical communications professional; Evidence-based medicine; EBM; Practical approach; Decision making	MACULAR DEGENERATION; RECOMMENDATIONS	The daily responsibilities of medical communications professionals require the application of evidence-based medicine (EBM) principles. Decision making based on personal experience alone, without knowledge from well-designed, controlled, randomized trials with adequate sample size, often overestimates the efficacy and underestimates the safety risks associated with drug therapy. The practice of EBM involves integrating clinical expertise with the best available evidence from systematic research. There are several EBM methods currently available; how-ever many of these are complex, requiring considerable time and effort. Medical communication professionals need a simple, time-sensitive, systematic EBM process they can quickly learn and integrate into their thought process and decision making. An EBM process developed by the University of Missouri, Kansas City School of Pharmacy Drug Information Center provides these attributes. This five-step evidence-based medicine process and a case study illustrating how the medical communications professional aplies the process are described in this article.

However, this practice is mainly based on expert opinion, and mounting evidence suggests holding aspirin perioperatively might not be more harmful than once thought. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to discuss the safety of continuing low-dose aspirin perioperatively in PCNL. Materials and Method: We performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library to identify relevant studies up to December 31st, 2021. The ROBINS-I (Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions) tool was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. The safety was assessed by all kinds of perioperative complications and bleeding complications mainly. Egger's test estimated publication bias. The statistical analyses were performed using Rev-Man 5.3 and STATA 15.1 software. Results: Overall, four eligible studies with a total of 1054 patients were included in our study. The meta-analysis results revealed that operative time (95%CI: -14.20 - 4.50, MD=-4.85, P=.31), hospital durations (95%CI: -1.80 - 0.50, MD=-0.65, P=.26), stone size (95%CI: -2.90 - 0.67, MD=-1.11, P=.22), and estimated blood loss (95%CI: -17.15 - 0.47, MD=-8.34, P=.06) were not significantly different between the continuing low-dose aspirin group and the control group. Moreover, there were no significant differences in total complication rate (25% vs 27.9%, 95%CI: -0.07 - 0.08, RD=0.00, P=.94) and serious complication rate (6.0% vs 3.0%, 95%CI: -0.08 - 0.06, RD=-0.01, P=.84) between the two groups. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in terms of bleeding complication rate (8.3% vs 14.0%, 95%CI: -0.04 - 0.06, RD=0.01, P=.75), transfusion rate (5.4% vs 10.8%, 95%CI: -0.04 - 0.04, RD=-0.00, P=.98), and postoperative thrombotic events rate (0.6% vs 0.2%, 95%CI: -0.03 - 0.02, RD=-0.00, P=.85). Sensitivity analysis suggested that our results were convincing and no publication bias was observed with the Egger's test (P=.112). Conclusion: It appears that continuing low-dose aspirin therapy perioperatively in PCNL might be relatively safe. However, further well-designed prospective studies with a large sample size are needed to confirm and validate our findings.

However, ASC research has two major knowledge gaps that hinder progression in understanding the concept of ASC and in providing proper support for autistic adults: (1) the majority of knowledge about ASC mainly stems from childhood studies so little is known about older autistic adults and (2) while it is broadly recognised that ASC is a heterogeneous condition, we do not yet understand the differences in trajectories leading to their future outcome. We aim to fill both knowledge gaps. Methods and analysis A multistage overlapping cohort design assessing (cognitive) ageing in ASC is designed to obtain an accelerated longitudinal data set. Data, including a multitude of questionnaires, diagnostics and cognitive tests, are collected over four waves within a 10-year time frame. This will provide information regarding actual changes in quality of life, co-occurring health conditions and cognition as well as the possibility to test external validity and temporal stability in newly formed behavioural subtypes. Participants consist of three groups of adults aged 20-90 years: (1) with a clinical diagnosis of ASC, (2) with a clinical diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) but no ASC, (3) no ASC/ADHD (ie, comparison group). The sample size differs between waves and instruments. Detailed analysis plans will be preregistered in AsPredicted or at the Open Science Framework.

To this end, 387 approved B- and T-cell epitopes, as well as 331 non-epitope peptides from different serotypes of the virus were collected from IEDB database for generating of the train datasets. After that, the physicochemical properties of the epitopes were expressed as the numeric vectors using Chou's pseudo amino acid composition method. The vectors then were used for training of four machine learning algorithms including artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machine (SVM) and Random forest (RF). The results confirmed that ANN was the most accurate algorithm for discriminating between the epitopes and non-epitopes with the accuracy of 0.90. Furthermore, for evaluating the performance of the ANN algorithm, an epitope prediction challenge was performed to a random peptide library from envelopment polyprotein of CCHFV. Moreover, the efficiency of the predicted epitopes in term of antigenicity and affinity to MHC-II were compared to the predicted epitope by standard epitope prediction tools based on their VaxiJen 2.0 score and molecular docking outputs. Finally, the ability of the screened epitopes to stimulation of humoral and cellular responses was evaluated by an in silico immune simulation process thought C-Immsim 10.1 server. The results confirmed that this method has more accuracy for epitope-mapping than the standard tools and could considered as an effective algorithm to develop a serotype independent one-click automated epitope based vaccine design tool.

Reliable information on soil erosion rates is, nevertheless, an essential prerequisite for the design of targeted erosion and sediment control strategies. This contribution reports the use of Cs-137 measurements to quantify medium-term ( similar to 40 years) soil erosion and redistribution rates in both cultivated and uncultivated areas within the Upper Kaleya River basin in southern Zambia. Typical net soil erosion rates are estimated to be 43 t ha(-1) year(-1) for areas under commercial cultivation. 2.9 t ha(-1) year(-1) for bush grazing areas and 2.5 t ha(-1) year(-1) for areas under communal cultivation. Although these erosion rates reflect land use in these broad areas over the past 40 years, rather than present land use, they are nevertheless thought to also be representative of current conditions. The findings indicate that any attempt to develop effective erosion and sediment control strategies in the study area should involve all land use types and should aim to reduce both on-site erosion and sediment delivery from the slopes to the stream channel.

The simple rules of a complex world: William Rand and Roland Rust	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING			English	Article						Standards; Methodology; Sufficiency; Agent-based modeling; Validity		Purpose - The purpose of this commentary is to explain that it is not useful to unnecessarily complicate a model. Striving for realism for its own sake does not advance understanding; however, making sure that a model provides valid insights is a useful goal. Design/methodology/approach - The authors advocate that a standard should exist based on whether experts in a field think that a particular mechanism is necessary for the model to achieve the goals of validity and sufficiency. Findings - The authors find that critiques that do not offer a more valid alternative model do not necessarily advance the production of science. Practical implications - Decision makers need to understand the assumptions and limitations of the models that they are using, but they should also be educated on the basic concepts of modeling literacy, and develop an understanding that all models are necessarily incomplete, as to make a model a perfect reflection of the real world would not provide insightful generalizations. Originality/value - Although the original paper provides some additional cases that should be explored in understanding the diffusion of information, the authors extend this paper by providing a standard that explains when it is necessary to examine additional extensions and when the original (less complex) model is sufficient.

The meshing clearance obtained by tooth profile modifications of cycloid gears is thought to have significant effects on performances of cycloid drives. In this study, this issue is clarified by developing a quasi-static load distribution model with considering four types of tooth profile modifications. Firstly, the unloaded tooth contact analysis is introduced to determine the meshing information, and the nonlinear Hertzian contact mechanics is applied to develop force-displacement relationships, Then, the loads distributed on gears, contact stress, loaded transmission error and gear ratio are calculated by enforcing the deformation compatibility, and force and moment equilibrium conditions. The predicted contact stress and deformation are compared with those by the finite element method, which shows a good agreement. With this, a tooth profile modification optimization method is proposed to obtain the optimal tooth profile modification at given radial clearances by using the two-dimensional parameter map. This study provides a useful tool to predict the multi-tooth contact conditions and to determine the most suitable tooth profile modification during the design process.

Using the 921 Earthquake in Taiwan as the theme, this study integrated the content of various subjects and course modules and applied information technology to present the humanistic care elements. The subjects of this study were Grade 9 students of a public middle school in central Taiwan. After the interactive operation introduction and theme film viewing, the students were divided into groups to participate in the technology action puzzle and obstacle challenge activities. Students' learning performance using smart technological tools and overall course feedback were evaluated from the aspects of building structure safety knowledge, disaster prevention and mitigation, integrated interdisciplinary thinking, and problem-solving abilities through the course planning and quasi-experimental design. The results show that (1) in terms of the learning achievement scale, the pre-test and post-test of paired samples reached statistical significance; (2) in terms of the learning response scale, the mean of the Likert five-point scale reached above 4.0; (3) the results of mediating regression analysis show that, compared with the traditional classroom teaching mode, the interactive teaching experience and technology action puzzle have a mediating effect on learning performance and overall course feedback.

Reflections on teaching and learning in an advanced undergraduate course in embedded systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION			English	Article						cognitive behavior; curriculum integration; embedded computer systems	CURRICULUM	An integrated series of courses on embedded systems has been developed at Iowa State University, Ames, spanning early undergraduate to graduate levels. The newest course in the series is CPRE 488: Embedded Systems Design, an advanced undergraduate course that fills a gap in the curriculum by providing system-level design experiences and incorporating new technology advancements. CPRE 488 development focused on lecture-lab integration and laboratory learning. Course and lab activities were designed using a learning model that captures lower-order and higher-order cognition levels of Bloom's taxonomy. The learning experience in the laboratory is characterized using a technique to assess cognitive behavior. Results of applying the Florida Taxonomy of Cognitive Behavior are presented to summarize the depth of student learning and the opportunities for students to progress to higher-order thinking in the laboratory. After two years of experience with the new course, the authors reflect on the course design and outcomes, from both disciplinary and pedagogical viewpoints.

Geometric information includes metric properties associated with spatial surfaces (e.g., short vs. long wall) and left-right directionality or 'sense' (e.g. a long wall to the left of a short wall). However, it remains unclear whether geometric information is encoded by explicitly computing the layout of surface geometry or by matching images of the environment. View-based spatial encoding is generally thought to hold for insect navigation and, very recently, evidence for navigation by geometry has been reported in ants but only in a condition which does not allow the animals to use features located far from the goal. In this study we tested the spatial reorientation abilities of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). After spatial disorientation, by passive rotation both clockwise and anticlockwise, bumblebees had to find one of the four exit holes located in the corners of a rectangular enclosure. Bumblebees systematically confused geometrically equivalent exit corners (i.e. corners with the same geometric arrangement of metric properties and sense, for example a short wall to the left of a long wall). However, when one wall of the enclosure was a different colour, bumblebees appeared to combine this featural information (either near or far from the goal) with geometric information to find the correct exit corner. Our results show that bumblebees are able to use both geometric and featural information to reorient themselves, even when features are located far from the goal.

Increasing Access to Physical Activity Within Low Income and Diverse Communities: A Systematic Review	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH PROMOTION			English	Review						health disparities; health promotion; community health; community interventions	HEALTH; PARKS; DISPARITIES; PROGRAM; INTERVENTION; OUTCOMES; EQUITY; YOUTH	Objective: The purpose of this review is to uncover some best practices for increasing access to physical activity opportunities by examining efforts used within low income and diverse communities. The theoretical lens used is from the Active Living by Design (ALbD) Community Action Model, with a focus on the 6 essential practices (health equity focus, community engagement, facilitative leadership, sustainable thinking, culture of learning, and strategic communication) describing how partnerships can guide and sustain meaningful change in a community. Methods: A 2-step process guided the literature search. In step 1, 4 databases (PubMed, Psych INFO, Social Science Citation Index, and Cochrane Library) were searched using Boolean connections and variations in the key terms. Step 2 assessed articles by title, abstract, and full text to determine whether the studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria guided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Additionally, included articles were compared against the 6 essential practices outlined by the ecological framework, ALbD. Results: Of 1775 total articles, 14 studies met inclusion criteria. Most of the studies were case studies located in the United States using several different approaches including, changes in the built environment, implementation of a community-based physical activity program, creating partnerships to leverage resources, and policy change. This review compared the 14 studies against the 6 essential practices of the ALbD model and found 2 studies that met all 6 criteria, and only a few studies meeting more than 2 criteria. Conclusions: Overall, the conclusions are 2-fold, (1) only 14 cases demonstrate success in increasing access to physical activity opportunities, suggesting that more can be done to address inequalities. (2) Of the existing efforts, few utilize crucial components to create a sustainable change in the community. Future research should take into consideration the ALbD ecological framework, the best existing theory for this type of work, to guide the creation and implementation of a sustainable community access effort.

To fully exploit this potential, deep research is needed into map-use processes considering the variability of map types and the cognitive complexity of map operations. Whereas research on map reading is relatively common, the research into cognitively more demanding operations is lacking. Therefore, this study employed an eye-tracking experiment combined with a follow-up questionnaire with 20 upper-secondary students to examine the strategies students choose when analyzing general-reference maps. Specifically, attention is paid to the strategy repertoire, distribution, efficiency, and adaptiveness of strategy choice. Subsequently, the study is focused on students' perception of strategies. According to the results, participants used a rich repertoire of strategies (although many of them unconsciously) and adapted the strategy choice to task demands. The solution efficiency varied among task demands, as did the efficiency of individual strategies and their combinations. The research design allowed a comparison with earlier studies on strategies for thematic map use. The results should be of interest to cartographers (to design effective educational tools) and educators (to educate map users complexly and effectively).

J	Tripp, BP; Orchard, J				Tripp, Bryan P.; Orchard, Jeff			Population coding in sparsely connected networks of noisy neurons	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neural networks; population coding; singular value decomposition; non-negative matrix factorization; layer2/3; network dynamics; network structure	SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; LOCAL CONNECTIVITY; INFORMATION; DYNAMICS; MT; DISPARITY; RESPONSES; SUMMATION; DIRECTION; MOTION	This study examines the relationship between population coding and spatial connection statistics in networks of noisy neurons. Encoding of sensory information in the neocortex is thought to require coordinated neural populations, because individual cortical neurons respond to a wide range of stimuli, and exhibit highly variable spiking in response to repeated stimuli. Population coding is rooted in network structure, because cortical neurons receive information only from other neurons, and because the information they encode must be decoded by other neurons, if it is to affect behavior. However, population coding theory has often ignored network structure, or assumed discrete, fully connected populations (in contrast with the sparsely connected, continuous sheet of the cortex). In this study, we modeled a sheet of cortical neurons with sparse, primarily local connections, and found that a network with this structure could encode multiple internal state variables with high signal-to-noise ratio. However, we were unable to create high-fidelity networks by instantiating connections at random according to spatial connection probabilities. In our models, high-fidelity networks required additional structure, with higher cluster factors and correlations between the inputs to nearby neurons.

Consumers get rich information from online reviews that may reduce their uncertainty regarding purchases. Besides, product-developing companies analyze user demands from online reviews to design market-driven product. In this study, a comparison among five major market share holder smart phone brands - Samsung, Apple, Huawei, Xiaomi, and Oppo is performed in different price categories - high, mid, and low range, based on sentiment polarity score. Online public reviews are extracted and sentiment scores of reviews are calculated to construct public sentiment polarity toward the famous brands. By examining both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, we identified the most important smart phone features or attributes that have great significance on consumer satisfaction. By experimenting and comparing five efficient machine-learning algorithms in predicting sentiment polarity and three feature selection algorithms in reducing attributes, an optimal set of 21 smart phone attributes was found those play major roles in determining customer satisfaction.

With increasing awareness of plastic pollution in the environment and the awareness of the importance for materials which are either made from renewable resources or are biodegradable, this topic provides a relevant opportunity to engage students. The semester-long laboratory experience has students working in teams first to complete a series of core experiments which provide a foundational experience in preparing and testing chitosan-alginate bioplastics prior to developing and implementing a project in a direction of their own choosing. The benefit of these student directed research projects can include enhanced engagement and can allow development of skills such as experiment design, data collection and analysis, written and oral dissemination, and critical thinking. We describe here both the core module in bioplastics which has the potential to be incorporated as a self-contained module by interested parties along with the way in which this is expanded to incorporate the student directed projects.

Asynchronous Physical-Layer Network Coding With Quasi-Cyclic Codes	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Compute-and-forward; physical-layer network coding; integer-forcing receiver	LDPC CODES; CHANNEL; AWGN	Communication in the presence of bounded timing asynchronism, which is known to the receiver but cannot be easily compensated, is studied. Examples of such situations include point-to-point communication over intersymbol interference (ISI) channels and asynchronous wireless networks. In these scenarios, although the receiver may know all the delays, it is often not an easy task for the receiver to compensate the delays as the signals are mixed together. A novel framework, which is called interleave/deinterleave transform (IDT), is proposed to deal with this problem. It is shown that the IDT allows one to design the delays so that quasi-cyclic (QC) codes with a proper shifting constraint can be used accordingly. When used in conjunction with QC codes, IDT provides significantly better performance than existing schemes relying solely on cyclic codes. Two instances of asynchronous physical-layer network coding, namely, the integer-forcing equalization for ISI channels and asynchronous compute-and-forward, are then studied. For integer-forcing equalization, the proposed scheme provides improved performance over using cyclic codes. For asynchronous compute-and-forward, the proposed scheme shows that there is no loss in the achievable information rates due to delays that are integer multiples of the symbol duration. Furthermore, the proposed approach shows that delays introduced by the channel can sometimes be exploited to obtain higher information rates than those obtainable in the synchronous case. The proposed IDT can be thought of as a generalization of the interleaving/deinterleaving idea proposed by Wang et al., which allows the use of QC codes, thereby substantially increasing the design space.

Trust in artificial intelligence: From a Foundational Trust Framework to emerging research opportunities PREFACE	ELECTRONIC MARKETS			English	Editorial Material						Artificial intelligence (AI); Trust; Foundational Trust Framework; Trust in AI; Explainable AI; Transparency; Systems	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; AUTOMATION; DISTRUST; DESIGN; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; CREDIBILITY; COOPERATION; EMPLOYMENT; SCIENCE	With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), the issue of trust in AI emerges as a paramount societal concern. Despite increased attention of researchers, the topic remains fragmented without a common conceptual and theoretical foundation. To facilitate systematic research on this topic, we develop a Foundational Trust Framework to provide a conceptual, theoretical, and methodological foundation for trust research in general. The framework positions trust in general and trust in AI specifically as a problem of interaction among systems and applies systems thinking and general systems theory to trust and trust in AI. The Foundational Trust Framework is then used to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of trust in AI. From doing so, a research agenda emerges that proposes significant questions to facilitate further advances in empirical, theoretical, and design research on trust in AI.

Method: The review was performed based on Arksey and O'Malley. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, ProQuest, and Science Direct databases were selected to search. All English language full-text articles from Jan 2020 to May 2021 were included. Initially, the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles were read and screening was accomplished based on the research question. After that, the full text of eligible studies was examined. A third reviewer was resolved disagreements at any stage by a consensus meeting. A self-assessment form was designed for data extraction. The causes of panic buying were assessed as a descriptive study. Results: The search process returned 23 articles after deletion for complete data extraction and analysis. Through thematic analysis, the factors influencing panic buying were divided into six categories including cognitive, emotional, behavioral, social, and economic factors as well as government action, and finally, the recommended strategies were categorized in two categories included psychosocial and economic. Conclusion: A holistic view of panic buying's causes allows planners and decision-makers to design categorized strategies beyond the suggested strategies. Increasing customer awareness and monitoring the flow of information through social media and mass media, psychotherapy, counseling, and economic strategies are considered by planners to combat panic buying.

Methods The study was conducted using the phenomenological method. Medical students' attitudes about and experiences with evidence-based medicine were determined through semi-structured interviews. Forty senior medical students were chosen by purposive sampling from medical sciences students of Tabriz University and Shahid Beheshti University. The context of interviews was analysed using the content analysis method. Results Medical students' attitudes and experiences were ascertained through four main questions, and their answers were divided in to 12 categories and 31 subcategories. According to the subjects of the study, two basic concepts that they understood about EBM were its being up to date and requiring research skills. To the question what is necessary for EBM, the students' answers were summarized as follows: access to information, teamwork and faculty members who could provide modeling and organizational support. Students reported having used EBM for problem solving, thinking and self-confidence. On the other hand, lack of equipment and facilities, human factors and organizational factors were considered the main barriers to EBM use. Conclusion According to the results of this study, providing suitable conditions and appropriate planning to address identified barriers and encouraging students can promote EBM practice. Also, more extensive EBM integration in medical curricula and clinical settings by leading faculty members would prompt medical students to use EBM in their daily practice.

Artificial intelligence is widely formulated and applied in varying ways in education, particularly by universities/colleges. AI is primarily established as information technology, a shift to internet-based and online intelligent education systems, and, eventually, integrated computer systems, other technologies, robotic devices, and internet Talkbots to execute teachers' roles and duties individually or through instructors. Talkbots are limited to audio and text inputs. The Real-Time Communication and AI-multimedia service assistance to the learners and teachers helps the education for a higher level of performance. Another trending aspect of higher education is virtual reality or augmented reality. This research designs AI-assisted Real-Time Communication and AI-multimedia Services Framework (AI-RCMP) to support higher education in universities/colleges. The Recurrent- Convolutional Neural Network applies for information decoding from AI-multimedia resources and Dimensional Pose estimation from augmented reality objects. The simulation analysis performed for this framework results in 94.68% accuracy. The other performance metrics such as precision, recall and F1 score are evaluated in the research to compare the proposed model with existing frameworks for higher education.

Based on the Motivated Information Processing in Groups (MIP-G) model, the current study aims to explore such joint effects on group idea gen-eration and idea selection. Both intergroup competition (high vs. low) and intragroup competi-tion (competition vs. cooperation) were experimentally manipulated, and 66 three-person groups were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions to perform a brainstorming task. Consistent with our hypotheses, results showed that two types of competitions interacted to determine group idea generation in that groups under the high intergroup competition and intragroup cooperation condition were most creative in terms of fluency and flexibility. Regardless of the level of intergroup competition, groups demonstrated a higher level of idea elaboration under intragroup cooperation but not competition conditions. Moreover, intergroup and intragroup competitions complemented each other in terms of originality in idea generation and idea selection. Specif-ically, groups under intragroup competition (rather than intragroup cooperation) condition generated and selected ideas of higher originality when the intergroup competition was low; instead, when the intergroup competition was high, the originality of generated or selected ideas was higher for groups under intragroup cooperation condition. We concluded with a discussion of the implications and value of these findings for theoretical research and management practice in organizations.

J	Li, D				Li, Dan			Machines Learn Better with Better Data Ontology: Lessons from Philosophy of Induction and Machine Learning Practice	MINDS AND MACHINES			English	Article						Induction; Machine learning; Data ontology; No Free Lunch theorem; Goodman's riddle of induction	CLIMATE; MODELS	As scientists start to adopt machine learning (ML) as one research tool, the security of ML and the knowledge generated become a concern. In this paper, I explain how supervised ML can be improved with better data ontology, or the way we make categories and turn information into data. More specifically, we should design data ontology in such a way that is consistent with the knowledge that we have about the target phenomenon so that such ontology can help us make the inductive leap. I do so by thinking through a thought experiment, Goodman's New Riddle of Induction (Fact, fiction, and forecast, Harvard University Press, 1955). Goodman's riddle helps flesh out three problems of induction: (1) the problem of equal goodies, that there are often too many equally good inductive results given the same data; (2) the problem of diverging performance, that these equally good results can give opposite predictions in the future; and (3) the problem of mediocrity, that when averaged across all equally possible datasets and tasks, no inductive algorithm outperforms any other. I show that all these three problems are manifested as real obstacles in ML practice, namely, the Rashomon effect (Breiman in Stat Sci 16(3):199-231, 2001), the problem of underspecification (D'Amour et al. in J Mach Learn Res, 2020, https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2011.03395), and the No Free Lunch theorem (Wolpert in Neural Comput 8(7):1341-90, 1996, https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1996.8.7. 1341). Lastly, I argue that proper data ontology can help mitigate these problems and I demonstrate how using concrete examples from climate science. This research highlights the links between philosophers' discussions of induction and implications in ML practice.

Digital game-based learning in K-12 mathematics education: a systematic literature review	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Review						Digital game-based learning; DGBL; Mathematics education; Systematic review	SUPPORTED VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; COMPUTER GAMES; STUDENT ENGAGEMENT; SURPRISING EVENTS; GOAL STRUCTURES; VIDEO GAMES; ONLINE GAME; MATH-GAME; PERFORMANCE	The application of mathematical skills is essential to our daily routine and is foundational for numerous disciplines. Among various computer-supported learning methods, Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL) has been perceived as a promising method in teaching mathematics, promoting students' interest, and motivation. Therefore, the aim of this systematic literature review is to provide a detailed synthesis of literature regarding the effectiveness of DGBL applications in K-12 mathematics education and extend the findings of previous reviews. This study reviewed a total of 43 articles published in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) of Web of Science, and other top-ranked educational technology journals between 2008 and 2019. The findings were then evaluated according to the multi-dimensional framework and classified into three main categories: knowledge acquisition, perceptual and cognitive skills, and affective, motivational, and behavioral change. This revealed that most of the reviewed studies have reported positive gains in all categories, with the traditional method of teaching being the most popular comparison approach. Numerous scholars also demonstrated a particular interest in the subject of arithmetic operations. The study also found that a considerable number of DGBL applications were constructed based on a specific design feature or learning theory. Furthermore, this study highlighted a number of research gaps in this domain according to which more research is required to understand how different dynamics (e.g., collaborative/cooperative, competitive) influence students' learning. Additionally, more studies are required to address the lack of research on twenty-first-century skills such as creativity and critical thinking. The findings of this review could benefit researchers and educators who are interested in using educational computer games to teach mathematics.

They can identify situations in which gathering information about distant and uncertain options is beneficial for the future. Because primates rely on scarce resources when they forage, they are also thought to strategically explore, but whether they use the same strategies as humans and the neural bases of strategic exploration in monkeys are largely unknown. We designed a sequential choice task to investigate whether monkeys mobilize strategic exploration based on whether that information can improve subsequent choice, but also to ask the novel question about whether monkeys adjust their exploratory choices based on the contingency between choice and information, by sometimes providing the counterfactual feedback about the unchosen option. We show that monkeys decreased their reliance on expected value when exploration could be beneficial, but this was not mediated by changes in the effect of uncertainty on choices. We found strategic exploratory signals in anterior and mid-cingulate cortex (ACC/MCC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). This network was most active when a low value option was chosen, which suggests a role in counteracting expected value signals, when exploration away from value should to be considered. Such strategic exploration was abolished when the counterfactual feedback was available. Learning from counterfactual outcome was associated with the recruitment of a different circuit centered on the medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), where we showed that monkeys represent chosen and unchosen reward prediction errors. Overall, our study shows how ACC/MCC-dlPFC and OFC circuits together could support exploitation of available information to the fullest and drive behavior towards finding more information through exploration when it is beneficial.

The states of single material particles are typically explained as being independent of other objects (and/or electromagnetic fields) and interactions. We argue that this independence causes counterintuitive explanations. By analyzing the research conducted separately by Wineland's group and Haroche's group, we naturally deduced that the states are dependent on other objects. Based on this dependence, our unified explanation is more intuitive. We design a double-slit thought experiment that can solve the center problem, i.e., which-path information. The dependence can also work for qubits in quantum information. To emphasize and use the dependence in the future, we propose a fundamental postulate that no material particle is free as the zeroth postulate of quantum mechanics.

MIDWIFERY STUDENTS KNOWLEDGE AND OPINIONS ABOUT FOOD ADDITIVES	OXIDATION COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						food additives; midwifery students; knowledge and opinions	ATTITUDES; TRUST; RISK	Food additives are substances not consumed as food alone, but added to food to maintain and improve the quality of the food or prevent it from undergoing unwanted changes during its preparation, sorting, processing, packaging, distribution, storage and placement on shelves. This study was planned to determine midwifery students knowledge levels about food additives who are to provide education and counseling about nutrition for people in the community they will work in after graduation. The study designed as a descriptive one was conducted with midwifery students attending the Faculty of Health Sciences. 220 students who agreed to participate in the study were included in the study. In order to analyse the data obtained, frequency distribution and chi-square analysis were performed by using the SPSS 22.0. P-values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant Of the participants, 38.2% were knowledgeable about food additives. Of them, 51.4% obtained this information through the social media, and 30.0% knew what additives were included in the food they bought. While 21.4% of the participants thought that the safety of food additives was ensured, 53.6% of them changed their minds and did not buy the food if they realized that the food included food additives. This present study shows that the midwifery students participating in the study were not knowledgeable enough about food additives. Their knowledge about systemic diseases caused by food additives, and substances used as food additives was not satisfactory either.	[Yurtsal, Z.

Advancing Risk Analysis for Nanoscale Materials: Report from an International Workshop on the Role of Alternative Testing Strategies for Advancement	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						Alternative testing strategies; expert workshop; nanomaterials; nanotoxicology; risk analysis	IN-VITRO; ENGINEERED NANOMATERIALS; NANOPARTICLES; TOXICITY; NANOTOXICOLOGY; IDENTIFICATION; HEALTH; CYTOTOXICITY; DOSIMETRY; FRAMEWORK	The Society for Risk Analysis (SRA) has a history of bringing thought leadership to topics of emerging risk. In September 2014, the SRA Emerging Nanoscale Materials Specialty Group convened an international workshop to examine the use of alternative testing strategies (ATS) for manufactured nanomaterials (NM) from a risk analysis perspective. Experts in NM environmental health and safety, human health, ecotoxicology, regulatory compliance, risk analysis, and ATS evaluated and discussed the state of the science for in vitro and other alternatives to traditional toxicology testing for NM. Based on this review, experts recommended immediate and near-term actions that would advance ATS use in NM risk assessment. Three focal areashuman health, ecological health, and exposure considerationsshaped deliberations about information needs, priorities, and the next steps required to increase confidence in and use of ATS in NM risk assessment. The deliberations revealed that ATS are now being used for screening, and that, in the near term, ATS could be developed for use in read-across or categorization decision making within certain regulatory frameworks. Participants recognized that leadership is required from within the scientific community to address basic challenges, including standardizing materials, protocols, techniques and reporting, and designing experiments relevant to real-world conditions, as well as coordination and sharing of large-scale collaborations and data. Experts agreed that it will be critical to include experimental parameters that can support the development of adverse outcome pathways. Numerous other insightful ideas for investment in ATS emerged throughout the discussions and are further highlighted in this article.	[Shatkin, J.

A Pluralistic Account of Homology: Adapting the Models to the Data	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						homology; network; comparative genomics; epaktolog; ortholog; paralog	DOMAIN ARCHITECTURE EVOLUTION; PROTEINS MAJOR IMPACT; GENE FUSION; SIMILARITY NETWORKS; METABOLIC PATHWAYS; COG DATABASE; IDENTIFICATION; ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; GENERATION	Defining homologous genes is important in many evolutionary studies but raises obvious issues. Some of these issues are conceptual and stem from our assumptions of how a gene evolves, others are practical, and depend on the algorithmic decisions implemented in existing software. Therefore, to make progress in the study of homology, both ontological and epistemological questions must be considered. In particular, defining homologous genes cannot be solely addressed under the classic assumptions of strong tree thinking, according to which genes evolve in a strictly tree-like fashion of vertical descent and divergence and the problems of homology detection are primarily methodological. Gene homology could also be considered under a different perspective where genes evolve as "public goods," subjected to various introgressive processes. In this latter case, defining homologous genes becomes a matter of designing models suited to the actual complexity of the data and how such complexity arises, rather than trying to fit genetic data to some a priori tree-like evolutionary model, a practice that inevitably results in the loss of much information. Here we show how important aspects of the problems raised by homology detection methods can be overcome when even more fundamental roots of these problems are addressed by analyzing public goods thinking evolutionary processes through which genes have frequently originated. This kind of thinking acknowledges distinct types of homologs, characterized by distinct patterns, in phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic unrooted or multirooted networks. In addition, we define " family resemblances" to include genes that are related through intermediate relatives, thereby placing notions of homology in the broader context of evolutionary relationships. We conclude by presenting some payoffs of adopting such a pluralistic account of homology and family relationship, which expands the scope of evolutionary analyses beyond the traditional, yet relatively narrow focus allowed by a strong tree-thinking view on gene evolution.

Diversity Interventions in the Classroom: From Resistance to Action	CBE-LIFE SCIENCES EDUCATION			English	Article							BEHAVIORAL INTENTIONS; COLOR-BLINDNESS; SCIENCE; PERFORMANCE; MULTICULTURALISM; METAANALYSIS; GENDER	What goes into faculty decisions to adopt a classroom intervention that closes achievement gaps? We present a theoretical model for understanding possible resistance to and support for implementing and sustaining a diversity-enhancing classroom intervention. We propose, examine, and refine a "diversity interventions-resistance to action" model with four key inputs that help explain faculty's decision to implement (or not) an evidence-based intervention: 1) notice that underrepresentation is a problem, 2) interpret underrepresentation as needing immediate action, 3) assume responsibility, and 4) know how to help. Using an embedded mixed-methods design, we worked with a sample of 40 biology faculty from across the United States who participated in in-depth, semistructured, qualitative interviews and surveys. Survey results offer initial support for the model, showing that the inputs are associated with faculty's perceived value of and implementation intentions for a diversity-enhancing classroom intervention. Findings from qualitative narratives provide rich contextual information that illuminates how faculty think about diversity and classroom interventions. The diversity interventions-resistance to action model highlights the explicit role of faculty as systemic gatekeepers in field-wide efforts to diversify biology education, and findings point to strategies for overcoming different aspects of faculty resistance in order to scale up diversity-enhancing classroom interventions.

There are a number of AI studies focusing on skin diseases, and there are many AI products that have been applied in dermatology. However, the attitudes of dermatologists, specifically those from China, towards AI, is not clear as few, if any studies have focused on this issue. Methods: A web-based questionnaire was designed by experts from the Chinese Skin Image Database (CSID) and published on the UMER Doctor platform (an online learning platform for dermatologists developed by the Shanghai Wheat Color Intelligent Technology Company, China). A total of 1,228 Chinese dermatologists were recruited and provided answers to the questionnaire online. The differences of dermatologists' attitudes towards AI among the different groups (stratified by age, gender, hospital level, education degree, professional title, and hospital ownership) were compared by using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis H test. The correlations between stratified factors and dermatologists' attitudes towards AI were calculated by using the Spearman's rank correlation test. SPSS (version 22.0) was utilized for all analyses. A two-sided P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant in all analyses. Results: A total of 1,228 Chinese dermatologists from 30 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and other regions (including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) participated in this survey. The dermatologists who participated acquired AI-related information mainly through the Internet, meetings or forums, and 70.51% of participated dermatologists acquired AI-related information by two or more approaches. In total, 99.51% of participated dermatologists pay attention (general, passive-active, and active attention) to information pertaining to AI. Stratified analyses revealed statistically significant differences in their attention levels (unconcerned, general, passive-active, and active attention) to AI-related information by gender, hospital level, education degree, and professional title (P values <= 1.79E-02). In total, 95.36% of the participated dermatologists thought the role of AI to be in "assisting the daily diagnosis and treatment activities for dermatologists". Stratified analyses about the thought of AI roles (unconcerned, useless, assist, and replace) showed that there was no statistically significant difference except for the hospital level (P value = 4.09E-03). The correlations between stratified factors with attention levels and the opinions of AI roles showed extremely weak correlations. Furthermore, 64.17% of participated dermatologists thought secondary hospitals in China are in most need of the application AI, and 91.78% of participated dermatologists thought the priority implementation of AI should be in skin tumors. Conclusions: The majority of Chinese dermatologists are interested in AI information and acquired information about AI through a variety of approaches. Nearly all dermatologists are attentive to information on AI and think the role of AI is in "assisting the daily diagnosis and treatment activities for dermatologists". Future AI implementation should be primarily focused on skin tumors and utilized in in secondary hospitals.

We discuss technical challenges arising from Visipedia and discuss their implications for pattern recognition, computer vision, machine learning and visual psychology. Amongst these are discovering visual information that is implicit in experts' brains and in crowds of people and estimating its accuracy. To motivate our thinking we explore a case study, an automated field guide to the birds of North America. We conclude by discussing research directions that are necessary to make progress on Visipedia. An important realisation is that the study of 'computer vision' and 'machine learning' has to be broadened to include the process of information discovery and the dynamic interaction of people and machines in this context. Human-machine systems with no oracle are now within the scope of pattern recognition, machine learning and computer vision. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The research goals include (a) to identify the main interaction difficulties present when executing addition and subtraction operations and (b) to improve the interaction design of the digital whiteboard interface to adapt it to DS characteristics. In order to achieve these goals, several studies (usability and educational) were conducted with experts and children. These methods and techniques included prototyping, questionnaires (pre-post), thinking out loud, video-recording and structured observation. As regards the interaction aspects with the whiteboard, the items evaluated included (a) mouse use, (b) placement of numbers and balls, (c) ball deletion and crossing out, (d) placement of the sign of the operation and (e) use of sensitive areas established in the worksheet. In addition, the paper presents the main strategies, procedures and errors of DS students for carrying out addition and subtraction algorithms that are more predominant in the DS population. Some relevant findings and results are presented, such as the importance of visual aids (graphics, balls, fingers, etc.) in teaching addition and subtraction to individuals with DS, the advantages of using the whiteboard for students who have difficulty writing, as they can focus on the operation at hand and forget their difficulties with handwriting, or mathematical errors arising from interaction issues.

The study is based on quantitative and qualitative research, using various data. Although digital cities are generally conceived as local information infrastructures, and as a means for enhancing democratic participation, users primarily appreciate it as a tool for communication. We also observed, among others, how cyberspace reproduces the dynamics of 'established and outsiders', which inclines us to think that 'virtual public space' is not as open as is often claimed.

J	Benerecetti, M; Bouquet, P; Bonifacio, M				Benerecetti, M; Bouquet, P; Bonifacio, M			Distributed context-aware systems	HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION			English	Article								Currently, context-aware applications are defined as applications that react appropriately to information sensed in the environment, as opposed to applications that elaborate only information explicitly provided by users. Context is (implicitly or explicitly) thought of as a collection of features of the (physical or virtual) environment, which can affect the behavior of an application. Though this notion of context is relatively unproblematic in systems with central control, it raises a number of challenging issues when applied to distributed systems-namely, systems in which control is distributed over a group of heterogeneous, autonomous, interacting entities (typically, agents). Indeed, in distributed applications, we cannot assume that autonomous entities share a context, even though each of them uses contextual information for its operations. In this essay, we discuss in detail this claim and present a notion of context that seems to be adequate for distributed systems. For the sake of illustration, we outline how this notion of context can be used to design distributed context-aware systems.

The key reason lies in the fact that such techniques extract clinical information with higher speed and accuracy compared to manual diagnosis by doctors. Moreover, the images serve as important records/evidences of diseases, hence the images are stored for the future use. However, among these advantages, there are growing issues with wide spread applications of imaging techniques. To be specific these issues are data (i) overloading, (ii) security/privacy, (iii) storage, (iv) transfer (especially, across institutes, regions, countries). In this paper we review the individual sources of medical image data. Based on this review, we discuss enabling technologies and present Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) as well as data mining as coping strategies for the overwhelming amount of digital image data encountered in modern clinical work flows.

This can be viewed as an optimization problem in a high-dimensional search space, often with many dozens of material parameters that need to be tuned. To tackle this, the evolutionary process in biology has been a source of inspiration in developing effective search algorithms. However, reaping the full benefits of bioinspired searches for materials design requires some thought. Here, we go beyond traditional black box algorithms and take a broader view of computational evolution strategies. We discuss recent strategies that exploit knowledge about the material configuration statistics and we highlight the advantages when time-varying environments are considered. Throughout, we emphasize that the search strategies themselves can be viewed as a nonequilibrium dynamical process in design space.

Software tool development is an important skills in the software engineering. However, generic teaching courses are hard to evaluate the integrated development skills from undergraduate students. This paper proposed a continuous collaboration model (CCM) and a view-based semi-automatic tool, OpenNeeds, develop and run as an Eclipse plug-in to proceed the functional requirements' analysis. These selected methods and tools include programming languages, markup language, information exchange standards, modeling language, model-view-controller (MVC) software framework, virtual machine handling, interface development environment, version control platform, knowledge management, software documentation, and software unit tests. The MVC tool can simply manipulate several requirement-related graphical components, such as mind view and use case view. The lateral thinking approach is adapted in grid view to assist in analyzing other potential requirements from the original ones. Subsequently, the source codes of this tool are opened and can be distributed via the Eclipse Public License from the OpenFoundry and Github repositories. There are three professors who come from two distinct colleges to share their learning experiences. Meanwhile, 26 and 27 college students attend this team in the first and second year, respectively. Professors can truly understand the fortes of the individual attendee through the attending performance and promote his/her merits in the future tasks. Further, their industrial practices and related outcomes might disclose that the proposed CCM is feasible and trustable in college environment, especially for the software development activities in the software engineering field.

Conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study investigated: (i) pregnant women's current usage of digital health tools to self-monitor and (ii) their interest in theoretical pregnancy app features (a direct patient-to-healthcare-professional communication tool and a body measurement tool). Using a mixed methods approach, 108 pregnant women were surveyed and 15 currently or recently pregnant women were interviewed online. We found that pregnant women used digital health tools to mainly access pregnancy related information and less so to self-monitor. Most participants were interested and enthusiastic about a patient-to-healthcare-professional communication tool. About half of the survey participants (49%) felt comfortable using a body measurement tool to monitor their body parts and 80% of interview participants were interested in using the body measurement to track leg/ankle swelling. Participants also shared additional pregnancy app features that they thought would be beneficial such as a "Digital Wallet" and a desire for a holistic pregnancy app that allowed for more continuous and personalised care. This study highlights the gaps and needs of pregnant women and should inform all stakeholders designing pregnancy digital healthcare. This study offers a unique insight into the needs of pregnant women during a very particular and unique period in human history.

Blood-brain barrier and innate immunity in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES: VISIONS FOR THE FUTURE, PT A	Progress in Molecular Biology and Translational Science		English	Review; Book Chapter							CEREBRAL AMYLOID ANGIOPATHY; NORMAL-PRESSURE HYDROCEPHALUS; BETA-PROTEIN; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; A-BETA; TRANSGENIC MICE; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY	The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is only partly understood. This is the probable reason why significant efforts to treat or prevent AD have been unsuccessful. In fact, as of April 2019, there have been 2094 studies registered for AD on the clinicaltrials.gov U.S. National Library of Science web page, of which only a few are still ongoing. In AD, abnormal accumulation of amyloid and tau proteins in the brain are thought to begin 10-20 years before the onset of overt symptoms, suggesting that interventions designed to prevent pathological amyloid and tau accumulation may be more effective than attempting to reverse a pathology once it is established. However, to be successful, such early interventions need to be selectively administered to individuals who will likely develop the disease long before the symptoms occur. Therefore, it is critical to identify early biomarkers that are strongly predictive of AD. Currently, patients are diagnosed on the basis of a variety of clinical scales, neuropsychological tests, imaging and laboratory modalities, but definitive diagnosis can be made only by postmortem assessment of underlying neuropathology. People suffering from AD thus may be misdiagnosed clinically with other primary causes of dementia, and vice versa, thereby also reducing the power of clinical trials. The amyloid cascade hypothesis fits well for the familial cases of AD with known mutations, but is not sufficient to explain sporadic, late-onset AD (LOAD) that accounts for over 95% of all cases. Since the earliest descriptions of AD there have been neuropathological features described other than amyloid plaques (AP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), most notably gliosis and neuroinflammation. However, it is only recently that genetic and experimental studies have implicated microglial dysfunction as a causal factor for AD, as opposed to a merely biological response of its accumulation around AP. Additionally, many studies have suggested the importance of changes in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in the pathogenesis of AD. Here we suggest how these less investigated aspects of the disease that have gained increased attention in recent years may contribute mechanistically to the development of lesions and symptoms of AD.

Therefore, it is thought that it would be important to inspect opinions of student nurses, who will be health employees in the future, about self-induced abortion to develop women health and public health. Objectives: The goal of this study is to inspect opinions of nursing students with different sociocultural specialties, about self-induced abortions. Research design: It is qualitative type and planned with ethnographic research pattern. Participants and research context: The study was conducted with 20 last-term students of Kirsehir Ahi Evran University, Faculty of Health Sciences, Department of Nursing, who were chosen by maximum diversity sampling technique. Interviews were made with semi-structured interview form and voice records during the study; data were analyzed with content analyzing method. Ethical considerations: Permission from the organization, university ethics committee, and personal approvals were taken from participants to conduct the research. Findings: Based on the analysis, two major themes on self-induced abortion in Turkish nursing students were found: dilemma of traditional perspective and professional identity and occupational awareness. Discussion and conclusion: It is seen that there is a dilemma between traditional point of view and professional identities about self-induced abortion for nursing students, but they had occupational awareness. It should be recommended to give information about national and international licit legislations for reproductive health, self-induced abortion, and setting up ethical discussion environments for nursing students.

J	Hilton, S; Smith, E				Hilton, Shona; Smith, Emily			"I thought cancer was one of those random things. I didn't know cancer could be caught ... ": Adolescent girls' understandings and experiences of the HPV programme in the UK	VACCINE			English	Article						Human papillomavirus; Teenagers; Perceptions	HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS; ATTITUDES; AWARENESS; PARENTS	Background: The UK human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme aims to provide girls aged 12-13 with protection against two of the most carcinogenic strains (types 16 and 18) of this sexually transmitted virus which together account for 70% of cases of cervical cancer. Despite evidence suggesting a general lack of knowledge about HPV and its link with cervical cancer, vaccine uptake rates were generally high in the UK for the first year of the HPV vaccination programme. In countries that implemented the HPV programme ahead of the UK, studies have found that girls' and parents' levels of awareness about HPV have increased since implementation of the programme but that knowledge continues to be limited. This study offers some of the first insights from the UK into adolescent girls' understandings of HPV, its link with cervical cancer, and experiences of vaccination, since the programme was introduced in September 2008. Method: Eighteen focus groups were conducted between December 2009 and May 2010 with schoolgirls aged between 12 and 18 living in various parts of the UK. Results: Eighty seven girls participated in these discussions. Typically, girls knew very little about HPV or how they could best protect themselves from HPV infection. Although many of the girls linked HPV to cancer, only half specifically associated it with cervical cancer. Most girls had no idea how long the vaccine would offer them protection. They assumed that HPV vaccination must be important for their health because it was recommended by people they trusted, namely parents and immunisation experts. Just over half of the girls were aware that in the future they would need to attend for cervical screening. Key concerns which girls expressed about HPV vaccination reflected their anxieties about needles, anticipated pain on injection, privacy during vaccination and fears about needle cleanliness. Conclusion: Our data point to a need to continue to address gaps in knowledge about HPV and to provide information to address girls' concerns about vaccination. This could be achieved through targeted campaign materials and by ensuring those involved in delivering the programme are aware of girls' anxieties to prevent limited knowledge and fears about vaccination becoming barriers either to HPV vaccination.

Cholesteryl glucosides signal through the carbohydrate recognition domain of the macrophage inducible C-type lectin (mincle)	ORGANIC & BIOMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Cholesteryl alpha-d-glucosides (alpha GCs) are unique metabolic products of the cancer-causing human pathogen Helicobacter pylori. Via signalling through the Macrophage inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) and the induction of a pro-inflammatory response, they are thought to play a role in the development of gastric atrophy. Herein, we prepared the first library of steryl d-glucosides and determined that they preferentially signal through the carbohydrate recognition domain of human Mincle, rather than the amino acid consensus motif. Lipidated steryl d-glucosides exhibited enhanced Mincle agonist activity, with C18 cholesteryl 6-O-acyl-alpha-d-glucoside (2c) being the most potent activator of human monocytes. Despite exhibiting strong Mincle signalling, sito- (5b) and stigmasterol glycosides (6b) led to a poor inflammatory response in primary cells, suggesting that Mincle is a potential therapeutic target for preventing H. pylori-mediated inflammation and cancer.

The majority of students viewed the online lectures before coming to class and reported that the online lectures helped them to complete the in-class activity and did not increase the amount of time they devoted to the course. In addition, students who viewed the online lecture performed better on clicker questions designed to test lower-order cognitive skills. The in-class activities then gave the students practice analyzing the information in groups and provided the instructor with feedback about the students' understanding of the material. On the basis of the results of this study, we support creating hybrid course models that allow students to learn the fundamental information outside of class time, thereby creating time during the class period to be dedicated toward the conceptual understanding of the material.

Dalle			"SWING": A European project for a new application of an ionospheric network	RADIO SCIENCE			English	Article						ionosphere; radio waves; propagation	COGNITIVE RADIO	The SWING (Short Wave critical Infrastructure Network based on a new Generation high survival radio communication system) is a European project aimed at studying a high survival high-frequency (HF) radio network to link European Critical Infrastructures (ECIs). This system is thought to replace broadband internet communication, maintaining the minimum flux of essential information for the ECIs management and control, in case of wide-scale threats, including terrorist attacks, able to put out of order internet links over the Mediterranean region. SWING is designed to evaluate the threat and increase the security awareness, as well as the level of protection, of analogous and/or interdependent ECIs. In order to meet these goals, SWING was finalized to recognize how and when the internet communication fails and to develop the standard software and hardware tools necessary for implementing communication protocols suited for a reliable and interoperable short-wave (SW) or high-frequency (HF) radio network backup. The internet broadband description and internet failure recognition were taken into consideration in the project but are not treated in this paper. It has been assessed that in case of complete failure of the internet broadband communication fundamental information for the management and control of ECIs over the Mediterranean region can be maintained with a HF network, even in case of moderate ionospheric perturbations.

Students design, build, program, and test their own single-wavelength, submersible photometer using low-cost light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and inexpensive household items. A series of structured prelaboratory assignments guide students through the processes of researching background information, designing a photometer device, and developing their own procedure to test the performance of the device. Students also learn basic skills of data acquisition by programming an easy-to-use LabVIEW interface for their device. Using a colorimetric indicator dye, students use their photometers and LabVIEW interfaces to determine the endpoint of an acid base titration and compare the linear response of their device against that of a commercially available spectrophotometer. Students who completed the experiment indicated that the experience improved their understanding of spectroscopy, as well as their critical thinking skills and research ability.

Among the different techniques, current distribution measurement owns the desired feature that can be performed during operation, revealing information about internal phenomena when the fuel cell is working. Moreover, short durability is one of the main problems that is hindering fuel cell wide implementation and it is known to be related to current density heterogeneities over the electrode surface. A good flow channel geometry design can favor a uniform current density profile, hence hypothetically extending fuel cell life. With this, it was thought that a study on the influence of flow channel geometry on the performance of a high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell using current distribution measurement should be a very solid work to optimize flow field design. Results demonstrate that the 4 step serpentine and pin-type geometries distribute the reactants more effectively, obtaining a relatively flat current density map at higher current densities than parallel or interdigitated ones and yielding maximum powers up to 25% higher when using oxygen as comburent. If air is the oxidant chosen, interdigitated flow channels perform almost as well as serpentine or pin-type due to that the flow conditions are very important for this geometry.

Consequently, policy selection can be thought of as a multiple objective problem with mixed quantitative and non-quantitative information on criterion scores. This paper presents an efficient approach to the multiple-criterion selection of actions, or subsets of actions, from a discrete set, in the presence of mixed criteria. In particular, the approach chooses good subsets of actions when the preferences of the Decision Maker (DM) over the actions are specified ordinally, cardinally, or according to qualitative properties on the criterion. First, a procedure is presented to screen and remove actions that cannot possibly be in the best subset. In the second stage, the performance of the remaining actions is evaluated to find the best possible subset.

Nevertheless, it is not known whether expertise-induced neuroplasticity can alter the multisensory processing that occurs in these low-level regions. The present study used magnetoencephalography to investigate whether musical training may induce neuroplastic changes of multisensory processing within the human auditory cortex. Magnetoencephalography data of four different experiments were used to demonstrate the effect of long-term and short-term musical training on the integration of auditory, somatosensory and visual stimuli in the auditory cortex. The cross-sectional design of three of the experiments allowed us to infer that long-term musical training is related to a significantly different way of processing multisensory information within the auditory cortex, whereas the short-term training design of the fourth experiment allowed us to causally infer that multisensory music reading training affects the multimodal processing within the auditory cortex.

J	Xiang, YB				Xiang Yibin			Research on the construction of quantum induction universe network	CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE			English	Article						quantum entanglement; quantum field; quantum induction network; quantum induction waves; quantum spin	ENTANGLEMENT PURIFICATION	The universe is filled with electromagnetic fields, quantum fields, and the other different field. They penetrate and interact with each other. Just as the interaction between magnetic materials are due to the magnetic field around the magnet contacting another magnet, between the quanta can also interact with each other through magnetic fields. Through the study of quantum mechanics and related theories of brain science, the article puts forward the following viewpoints: between quantum, which has entanglement state, cannot only interact through magnetic fields but also generate quantum induction fields to generate quantum induction waves. The entangled quantum generated spin waves are connected to each other based on quantum inductive waves to form a quantum inductive network. Then, the information is transmitted through resonance to realize the communication between all things. Thus, all things in the universe can be interconnected based on quantum entanglement effects. By analyzing the construction mode of the internet network, the paper proposes the architecture of the quantum induction communication system and the basic topology of a quantum induction internet network. Several thought experiment schemes were designed, and the information transmission between the ordinary objects and between the people and ordinary objects is studied as an example. The analysis points out the main problems faced by the construction of the quantum induction internet. It points out that the significance of constructing of the network of All things interconnect based on quantum entanglement effect is that all living bodies and nonliving bodies in the heaven and earth can be connected and communicate with each other.

By utilizing the hesitant fuzzy elements to represent the fuzziness of the objects and the hesitant thought of the experts, this paper introduces the negative exponential function into the prospect theory so as to portray the psychological behaviors of the experts, which transforms the hesitant fuzzy decision matrix into the hesitant fuzzy prospect decision matrix (HFPDM) according to the expectation-levels. Then, this paper applies the energy and the entropy in thermodynamics to take the quantity and the quality of the decision values into account, and defines the thermodynamic decision making parameters based on the HFPDM. Accordingly, a whole procedure for emergency decision making is conducted. What is more, some experiments are designed to demonstrate and improve the validation of the emergency decision making procedure. Last but not the least, this paper makes a case study about the emergency decision making in the firing and exploding at Port Group in Tianjin Binhai New Area, which manifests the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method.

Despite their importance, views on the usefulness of animal "models" vary widely, ranging from outright negation on the grounds that human minds are unique, to the more biological view that because of a partially common phylogenetic history, animals share many behavioural features with humans, e.g. learning, attention, aggression or sociality, which are altered in psychiatric disorders. The widespread use of ethology with its emphasis upon the function and origin of behaviour, particularly social behaviour, is based upon this evolutionary view. Many ethopharmacological tests in animals use situations which bias the animal's behaviour towards flight or sociality but their validation requires clinical feedback from humans. Unfortunately, information relating to human social mechanisms is rarely obtainable from conventional clinical-assessment schemes. To help overcome this problem, we have applied ethological principles to a new Challenge interview Situation which is designed to bias the behaviour of healthy subjects towards flight. Analysis shows that by staring, moving closer or asking the subjects to relate emotional experiences, shifts in non-verbal behaviour towards avoidance and mild social withdrawal are achieved which resemble behavioural strategies recorded ethologically in depressed patients as well as animals in an arrested flight situation. The Challenge Interview is intended for early drug studies in humans where sociality is a target and can be adapted for concomitant endocrine and biochemical studies if required.

This procedure is thought to facilitate for subjects the acquisition of the information related to the structural description of the faces (that is, without associated verbal/semantic information) using preferentially analytic processing strategies. The parameter d' of the Theory of Signal Detection allowed us to evaluate in the course of the learning sessions the degree of familiarization achieved with the studied faces. Subsequently, an ERPs' recording session was carried out, during which subjects executed a face-feature matching task. In this task, similar in structure to that carried out in the learning sessions, the subject had to decide whether the automatic completion of the faces that was made was correct or incorrect. ERPs' effects related to mismatching features were obtained, which indicate the existence of specific cerebral mechanisms involved in the recognition of faces. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Pedrycz, W				Pedrycz, W			Computational intelligence and visual computing: am emerging technology for software engineering	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						computational intelligence; information granulation; neural networks; software quality; rule-based computing; software measures		The discipline of Software Engineering is abstract and complex with all its endeavors being cast in a knowledge-intensive environment. It is not surprising that there have been a number of important initiatives that have attempted to address a burning need for solid development tools and comprehensive environments supporting an in-depth analysis. The objective of this study is to discuss a role of Computational Intelligence (CI) and visual computing being viewed as a sound methodological and algorithmic environment for knowledge-oriented Software Engineering. The CI itself is regarded as a synergistic consortium of granular computing (including fuzzy sets) promoting abstraction, neurocomputing supporting various learning schemes and evolutionary computing providing important faculties of global optimization. By its very nature, Cl embraces a diversity of design paradigms; in particular it promotes a top-down approach (when exploiting fuzzy sets first and afterwards working in the neural network environment) or bottom-up style (where these two technologies are used in a reverse order). Visual computing is inherently associated with CL it is human-centric where fuzzy sets make visualization activities feasible. Fuzzy sets are treated as a graphic means of accepting information from users. They are regarded as a vehicle used to visualize results in a linguistic manner. Software Engineering and Cl are highly compatible: they are knowledge-intensive, human-oriented, and have to deal with various manifestations of the abstract world of software constructs and thought processes. This multifaceted conceptual compatibility is a prerequisite for the development of vital synergistic links that bring the technology of CI into Software Engineering. The symbiosis accrues considerable benefits for both technologies by posing new categories of challenging and highly stimulating problems. The facet of visual computing is essential in handling of software processes and software products. The intent of this study is to provide a general overview of this new development in Software Engineering. In particular, we highlight a number of selected and most visible trends occurring at the junction of Cl and Software Engineering. Furthermore we discuss several specific applications of the technology of Cl to software cost estimation, analysis of software measures and neural models of software quality.

We have investigated the effect induced by desflurane, a clinically used general anesthetic, on information transfer at the synapse between mossy fibers and granule cells of cerebellum, where this analysis can be carried out extensively. Mutual information values were assessed by measuring the variability of postsynaptic output in relationship to the variability of a given set of presynaptic inputs. Desflurane synchronized granule cell firing and reduced mutual information in response to physiologically relevant mossy fibers patterns. The decrease in spike variability was due to an increased postsynaptic membrane excitability, which made granule cells more prone to elicit action potentials, and to a strengthened synaptic inhibition, which markedly hampered membrane depolarization. These concomitant actions on granule cells firing indicate that desflurane re-shapes the transfer of information between neurons by providing a less informative neurotransmission rather than completely silencing neuronal activity.

Semi-supervised clustering algorithms designed based on Kmeans, such as the classical Seeded-Kmeans and Constrained-Kmeans, where supervision information is used to guide clustering iterations, have the same disadvantages as the original Kmeans algorithm: they are confined to the assumption of isotropic spherical clusters, leading to the narrow adaptability in handling data of various characteristics. To solve the problem, we propose the scattered centroids initialization clustering algorithm based on Stratification (SCICS). First, based on the concept of influence space, a method for modeling the cluster -level location of any object is presented, according to which we can obtain well-defined cluster decision boundaries through stratification. On this basis, by extending the seed thought, we propose a semi-supervised subclustering algorithm that can break through the limitations of partitional clustering methods that rely on strict assumptions on particular cluster distributions. Experiments on artificial and real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm gains the ability of clustering arbitrary shaped data and surpasses the competitors in terms of performance and adaptability.

Ethical and Social Issues in Pharmacogenomics Testing	CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN			English	Review						Pharmacogenomics; ethics; privacy; veracity; informed consent; anti-discrimination legislation; translation research; implementation	PERSONALIZED MEDICINE; GENOMIC MEDICINE; SOCIETY; SCIENCE; LESSONS; TRIAL; LEGAL	In genomics research, pathways that lead to disease and the role of drugs in these pathways are being unravelled at a high rate. In this paper ethical and social challenges related to pharmacogenomics research are discussed as well as clinical applications. In research, ethical thinking evolves due to the fast pace of research. Genome-wide association studies trying to identify genes that contribute a small risk to common diseases can only be performed on an international scale. Meanwhile, it is becoming more and more clear that genomic information is hard to hide. Thus the traditional promise in research that privacy will be protected appears to be less realistic. Nowadays, adequate information (veracity) and protection against potential risks of discrimination based on predictive medical information is required. A new balance needs to be found. In the clinic, different ethical and social challenges become apparent. The promise to improve diagnosis, treatment and prevention is genuine, but many potentially useful applications do not reach the bedside. There is a need for both translation and for assessment of evidence if "do good and do not harm" is to be taken seriously. In addition, sustainable use of pharmacogenetic knowledge holds promises for developed and developing countries but these promises will only materialize if evidence is built, translated into guidelines, incorporated into education, implemented in pharmacy databases, and evaluated. While translational research in health care progresses slowly, direct-to-consumer testing is being implemented rapidly. International validated quality criteria should apply both to health care and to this commercial field.	[Vijverberg, S. J.

This study explores the level of understanding and perceptions of genetics and inherited eye diseases and the attitudes to genetic testing and gene therapy. Methods: The study was conducted in two parts. Participant groups included were: undergraduate students of optometry, primary eye care professionals and members of the general public. A preliminary study aimed to understand perceptions and to explore the level of knowledge about genetics in general, eye genetics and gene therapy. A second survey was designed to explore attitudes to genetic testing and gene therapy. Results: The majority of participants (82%) perceived genetics as an important science. However, none of them showed a high level of understanding of genetics and inherited eye diseases. Undergraduate students and primary eye care professionals were better informed about inherited eye diseases than the general public (p = 0.001). The majority (80%) across all three groups had a positive attitude to genetic testing and gene therapy. There was a lack of knowledge about the genetic services available among all groups of participants. Conclusion: This calls for serious thinking about the level of dissemination of information about genetics and inherited eye diseases. It shows a broadly supportive attitude to genomic medicine among the public. Improving public awareness and education in inherited eye diseases can improve the utility of genetic testing and therapy.

J	Kim, J; Rundle-Thiele, S; Knox, K; Burke, K; Bogomolova, S				Kim, Jeawon; Rundle-Thiele, Sharyn; Knox, Kathy; Burke, Kirsty; Bogomolova, Svetlana			Consumer perspectives on household food waste reduction campaigns	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Food waste; Consumer behaviour; Campaign development; Codesign; Social marketing	SOURCE SEPARATION; BEHAVIOR; INFORMATION; ENGAGEMENT; MANAGEMENT; BARRIERS; STRATEGY; SUCCESS; POINT	Food waste places pressure on the environment, costing communities and households substantial amounts of money. Yet, many previous studies rely on expert opinions to inform campaign design. To affect change, researchers and practitioners need to be open to alternative ways of thinking, including the views of the consumers. This paper extends research pathways traditionally applied in social marketing and co-design processes to consumers in the context of household food waste reduction. To offer a fresh perspective on current practice, we conducted a mixed-method formative research study as follows: co-design (Study 1; N = 21), A-B comparison study via an online survey (Study 2; N = 414), and a fridge audit (Study 3; N = 197). Addressing a gap in previous expert-led campaigns, our study incorporates consumer views on food waste campaigns. Findings indicate consumers prefer: (a) targeting leftover-reuse behaviour, (b) using technology and avoiding door-knocking as a campaign strategy and (c) a focus on reducing fruit and vegetable waste. This study demonstrates the value of applying social marketing and the co-design process to the issue of household food waste. A point of difference associated with the social marketing approach employed in this study is the active participation of the consumers in campaign development. This paper offers rich information for researchers and/or practitioners that can guide program development, based on verified consumer expectations and has potential to benefit campaign effectiveness.

Ideas about optimal management depend on the confluence of patient-specific variables, surgical expertise, and the state of medical knowledge. In this, complex and progressing setting, an up-to-date decision support system could help physicians apply the latest evidence to patient care. Carotid ultrasonography (VS) studies provide an excellent opportunity to aid in the therapy of carotid stenosis. We developed a Carotid US Report Enhancement (CURE) to augment carotid US reports with treatment-specific prognostic information and patient-specific Portions of the American Heart Association's 1998 guideline for the management of carotid artery stenosis. In the process of designing and implementing the CURE software, we encountered and eventually solved a variety of problems. The first problem was that US test was not always precise enough to distinguish between a moderate and mild carotid stenosis. Likewise, the standard US reports did not elucidate several technical problems that decreased the reliability of the US result. Third, although 17 of 18 physicians agreed to receive the CURE reports, they requested non-incriminating wording. Fourth, vascular surgeons supervising the US laboratories were reluctant to support the CURE report if they thought it would be construed as prompting self-referral, Finally, information about some comorbid conditions (e.g. a history of atrial fibrillation) could not be obtained reliably from the patients. The result of responding to these problems is a decision support program that is increasingly robust, able to detect many of its own limitations, and capable of integrating data from multiple sources. A randomized controlled trial now in progress will evaluate the clinical impact of the CURE program.

The differences in the performance of participants in convergent creativity caused by bilingual learning is a popular research area in creativity. A final sample of 68 participants was asked to complete the remote associates test (RAT). The results indicate that a moderate positive correlation exists between bilingual learning and convergent creativity. Students who want to study abroad perform better on the RAT than those who do not, and this effect is mediated by second language proficiency. These findings suggest that improving students' English proficiency and increasing their opportunities to study abroad may be effective ways to promoting convergent creativity.

Guidelines for establishing a 3-D printing biofabrication laboratory	BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVANCES			English	Review						Bioprinting; Biofabrication; Tissue engineering; Cloud manufacturing; Deep learning	CROSS-VALIDATION; SECURITY ISSUES; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; HEALTH-CARE; BIG-DATA; 3D; TISSUE; MODEL; TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGIES	Advanced manufacturing and 3D printing are transformative technologies currently undergoing rapid adoption in healthcare, a traditionally non-manufacturing sector. Recent development in this field, largely enabled by merging different disciplines, has led to important clinical applications from anatomical models to regenerative bioscaffolding and devices. Although much research to-date has focussed on materials, designs, processes, and products, little attention has been given to the design and requirements of facilities for enabling clinically relevant biofabrication solutions. These facilities are critical to overcoming the major hurdles to clinical translation, including solving important issues such as reproducibility, quality control, regulations, and commercialization. To improve process uniformity and ensure consistent development and production, large-scale manufacturing of engineered tissues and organs will require standardized facilities, equipment, qualification processes, automation, and information systems. This review presents current and forward-thinking guidelines to help design biofabrication laboratories engaged in engineering model and tissue constructs for therapeutic and non-therapeutic applications.

J	Gao, HM; Liu, HW; Ma, HY; Ye, CJ; Zhan, MJ				Gao, Hongming; Liu, Hongwei; Ma, Haiying; Ye, Cunjun; Zhan, Mingjun			Network-aware credit scoring system for telecom subscribers using machine learning and network analysis	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS			English	Article						Credit scoring; Relation network; Stochastic equivalence; Power-law distribution; Machine learning; Deep learning	BIG DATA; PREDICTION; MODELS	Purpose A good decision support system for credit scoring enables telecom operators to measure the subscribers' creditworthiness in a fine-grained manner. This paper aims to propose a robust credit scoring system by leveraging latent information embedded in the telecom subscriber relation network based on multi-source data sources, including telecom inner data, online app usage, and offline consumption footprint. Design/methodology/approach Rooting from network science, the relation network model and singular value decomposition are integrated to infer different subscriber subgroups. Employing the results of network inference, the paper proposed a network-aware credit scoring system to predict the continuous credit scores by implementing several state-of-art techniques, i.e. multivariate linear regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, multilayer perceptron, and a deep learning algorithm. The authors use a data set consisting of 926 users of a Chinese major telecom operator within one month of 2018 to verify the proposed approach. Findings The distribution of telecom subscriber relation network follows a power-law function instead of the Gaussian function previously thought. This network-aware inference divides the subscriber population into a connected subgroup and a discrete subgroup. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the network-aware decision support system achieves better and more accurate prediction performance. In particular, the results show that our approach considering stochastic equivalence reveals that the forecasting error of the connected-subgroup model is significantly reduced by 7.89-25.64% as compared to the benchmark. Deep learning performs the best which might indicate that a non-linear relationship exists between telecom subscribers' credit scores and their multi-channel behaviours. Originality/value This paper contributes to the existing literature on business intelligence analytics and continuous credit scoring by incorporating latent information of the relation network and external information from multi-source data (e.g. online app usage and offline consumption footprint). Also, the authors have proposed a power-law distribution-based network-aware decision support system to reinforce the prediction performance of individual telecom subscribers' credit scoring for the telecom marketing domain.

Neutralizing antibodies against the highly conserved M2 ion channel is thought to offer broad protection against influenza A viruses. Here, we screened synthetic Camel single-domain antibody (VHH) libraries against native M2 ion channel protein. One of the isolated VHHs, M2-7A, specifically bound to M2-expressed cell membrane as well as influenza A virion, inhibited replication of both amantadine-sensitive and resistant influenza A viruses in vitro, and protected mice from a lethal influenza virus challenge. Moreover, M2-7A showed blocking activity for proton influx through M2 ion channel. These pieces of evidence collectively demonstrate for the first time that a neutralizing antibody against M2 with broad specificity is achievable, and M2-7A may have potential for cross protection against a number of variants and subtypes of influenza A viruses.

J	Wang, YT; Sun, MX; Yang, XC; Yuan, XL				Wang, Yutao; Sun, Mingxing; Yang, Xuechun; Yuan, Xueliang			Public awareness and willingness to pay for tackling smog pollution in China: a case study	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Smog and haze; Environmental awareness; Prevention and control; Environmental investment; Willingness to pay	HAZE POLLUTION; AIR-POLLUTION; PERFORMANCE; EPISODES; QUALITY	In recent years, smog has become one of greatest challenges in China and many other countries. However, there are limited attentions of measuring public environment awareness of air pollution and the relations between public environmental awareness and smog prevention in a Chinese context. This study was designed to investigate the facts of public environmental awareness in a typical city of China after the serious smog in the beginning of 2013. The relationship between willingness to pay (WTP) of the residents for tackling smog pollution and their knowledge of the health hazard of smog was also explored. We found that most of respondents heard of smog mainly from news and thought that human activities are the main causes of heavy smog. Around 60% of the respondents wanted to support activities for coping with smog. Using public transportation (77.67%) and using energy saving appliances (72.74%) are environmentally friendly measures that most respondents wanted to practice. The average WTP for self-protection after information disclosure was significantly higher than that before information disclosure. The WTP for supporting smog control and preventive actions before and after information disclosure showed the same trend as WTP for self-protection. However, people wanted to pay more for self-protection than for supporting smog control and preventive actions, which indicated that individuals tend to think that the government should have more roles in smog control and prevention. The factors of age, occupations, education, and income had impacts on the WTP of the residents, but education and income were the most significant. This research suggested that enhancing public environmental education and providing accessible environmental knowledge to residents for tackling smog pollution are of great importance. The knowledge provided by this paper may contribute to smog prevention especially from a public participation perspective. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While much research has worked on developing automatic retrieval models, how to characterize relevance in this specialized information retrieval (IR) task is still an open question. Towards an in-depth understanding of relevance judgments, we conduct a laboratory user study that involves 72 participants of different domain expertise. In the user study, we collect the relevance score along with detailed explanations for the relevance judgment and various measures of the judgment process. From the collected data, we observe that both the subjective (e.g., domain expertise) and objective (e.g., query/case property) factors influence the relevance judgment process. By investigating the collected user explanations, we identify task-specific patterns of user attention distribution and re-think the criteria for relevance judgments. Moreover, we investigate the similarity in attention distribution between models and users. Further, we propose a two-stage framework that utilizes user attention to improve relevance estimation for legal case retrieval. Our study sheds light on understanding relevance judgments in legal case retrieval and provides implications for improving the design of corresponding retrieval systems.

This study assessed whether Portuguese family physicians are aware of the costs of the most frequently prescribed diagnostic and laboratory tests. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in a representative sample of Portuguese family physicians, using computer-assisted telephone interviews for data collection. A Likert scale was used to assess physician's level of agreement with four statements about health care costs. Family physicians were also asked to estimate the costs of diagnostic and laboratory tests. Each physician's cost estimate was compared with the true cost and the absolute error was calculated. Results One-quarter (24%; 95% confidence interval: 23%-25%) of all cost estimates were accurate to within 25% of the true cost, with 55% (95% IC: 53-56) overestimating and 21% (95% IC: 20-22) underestimating the true actual cost. The majority (76%) of family physicians thought they did not have or were uncertain as to whether they had adequate knowledge of diagnostic and laboratory test costs, and only 7% reported receiving adequate education. The majority of the family physicians (82%) said that they had adequate access to information about the diagnostic and laboratory test costs. Thirty-three percent thought that costs did not influence their decision to order tests, while 27% were uncertain. Conclusions Portuguese family physicians have limited awareness of diagnostic and laboratory test costs, and our results demonstrate a need for improved education in this area. Further research should focus on identifying whether interventions in cost knowledge actually change ordering behavior, in identifying optimal methods to disseminate cost information, and on improving the cost-effectiveness of care.

An IPP provides a hospitalized patient with similar functions to those found in outpatient portals, including the ability to view vital signs, laboratory results, and medication information; schedule appointments; and communicate with their providers. However, IPPs may offer additional functions such as meal planning, real-time messaging with the inpatient care team, daily schedules, and access to educational materials relevant to their specific condition. In practice, IPPs have been developed as websites and tablet apps, with hospitals providing the required technology as a component of care during the patient's stay. Objective: This study aimed to describe how inpatients are using IPPs at the first academic medical center to implement a system-wide IPP and document the challenges and choices associated with this analytic process. Methods: We analyzed the audit log files of IPP users hospitalized between January 2014 and January 2016. Data regarding the date/time and duration of interactions with each of the MyChart Bedside modules (eg, view lab results or medications and patient schedule) and activities (eg, messaging the provider and viewing educational videos) were captured as part of the system audit logs. The development of a construct to describe the length of time associated with a single coherent use of the tool-which we call a session-provides a foundational unit of analysis. We defined frequency as the number of sessions a patient has during a given provision day. We defined comprehensiveness in terms of the percentage of functions that an individual uses during a given provision day. Results: The analytic process presented data challenges such as length of stay and tablet-provisioning factors. This study presents data visualizations to illustrate a series of data-cleaning issues. In the presence of these robust approaches to data cleaning, we present the baseline usage patterns associated with our patient panel. In addition to frequency and comprehensiveness, we present considerations of median data to mitigate the effect of outliers. Conclusions: Although other studies have published usage data associated with IPPs, most have not explicated the challenges and choices associated with the analytic approach deployed within each study. Our intent in this study was to be somewhat exhaustive in this area, in part, because replicability requires common metrics. Our hope is that future researchers in this area will avail themselves of these perspectives to engage in critical assessment moving forward.

J	Hwarng, HB; Xie, N				Hwarng, H. Brian; Xie, Na			Understanding supply chain dynamics: A chaos perspective	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						supply chain management; chaos theory; beer distribution game; system dynamics	LEAD TIMES; INFORMATION; IMPACT; MODEL	Variability in orders or inventories in supply chain systems is generally thought to be caused by exogenous random factors such as uncertainties in customer demand or lead time. Studies have shown, however, that orders or inventories may exhibit significant variability even if customer demand and lead time are deterministic. In this paper, we investigate how this class of variability, chaos, may occur in a multi-level supply chain and offer insights into how to manage relevant supply chain factors to eliminate or reduce system chaos. The supply chain is characterized by the classical beer distribution model with some modifications. We observe the supply chain dynamics under the influence of various factors: demand pattern, ordering policy, demand-information sharing, and lead time. Through proper decision-region formation, the effect of various factors on system chaos is investigated using a factorial design. The degree of system chaos is quantified using the Lyapunov exponent across all levels of the supply chain. This study shows that, to reduce the degree of chaos in the supply chain system, the adjustment parameters for both inventory and supply line discrepancies should be more comparable in magnitude. Counter-intuitively, in certain decision regions, sharing demand information can do more harm than good. Similar to the bullwhip effect observed previously in demand, we discover the phenomenon of "chaos-amplification" in inventory across supply chain levels. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The importance of these features may differ with regional climates. Methods: Concentrations of mite allergen were analysed as a function of housing features. Information on housing features was collected by questionnaire in 50 houses in two towns in a dry inland region of Australia. Mite allergen (Der p 1) was measured by ELISA in dust samples collected on five occasions over 2 years from beds and floors. Results: Der p 1 was detected in all houses. Many housing features did not influence mite allergen concentrations. However, the presence of evaporative cooling increased mite allergen by 3.34-fold in beds (P = 0.007) and 3.94-fold in floors (P = 0.003). Mite allergen was threefold higher in mattresses > 5 years old. and synthetic and feather duvets tended to have higher and lower levels of mite allergen, respectively. Conclusions: In houses in dry, inland regions of Australia, evaporative cooling and older mattresses are associated with higher concentrations of mite allergen. Alternative forms of air conditioning to evaporative cooling may be useful for control of mite allergen in dry regions.

Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using CiteSpace's keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost. Finally, seven future research directions are suggested, which emphasise on several PI/DT-related issues, including business ecosystem, sustainability development, SC downstream management, cognitive thinking in Industry 5.0, citizen twin in digital society, and SC resilience.

However, for wild plant populations there is little information on the amount of genetic variation for such traits. We estimated broad- and narrow-sense heritability of floral and reproductive traits for two populations of the perennial wildflower Penstemon centranthifolius, using a paternal half-sib crossing design in one case, and clonal propagation of ramets from different genets in the other. In both designs, most traits were significantly heritable, including nectar production, corolla length and width, inflorescence length and total flower production. Flowering date was significantly heritable for the crosses, but not for the clones, while nectar sugar concentration was not significantly heritable in either design. Genetic correlations were in some cases strong, and in some cases differed greatly from the corresponding phenotypic correlations. These results indicate that P. centranthifolius harbours a large reservoir of genetic variance which could support an evolutionary response to phenotypic selection.

This effect, known as the truth bias, has often been characterized as a judgmental error that impedes accuracy. We consider an alternative view: that it reflects the use of contextual information to make the best guess when the currently available information has low diagnosticity. Participants learnt the diagnostic value of four cues, which were present during truthful statements between 20% and 80% of the time. Afterwards, participants were given contextual information: either that most people would lie or that most would tell the truth. We found that people were biased in the direction of the context information when the individuating behavioral cues were nondiagnostic. As the individuating cues became more diagnostic, context had less to no effect. We conclude that more general context information is used to make an informed judgment when other individuating cues are absent. That is, the truth bias reflects a smart guess in a low diagnostic world. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	[Street, Chris N.

J	Main, JB; Wang, YB; Tan, L				Main, Joyce B.; Wang, Yanbing; Tan, Li			The career outlook of engineering PhDs: Influence of postdoctoral research positions on early career salaries and the attainment of tenure-track faculty positions	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						career paths; faculty; PhD students; postdoctoral training; salaries	LIFE-SPACE APPROACH; DOCTORATE; DURATION; POLICY	Background The number of engineering PhDs pursuing postdoctoral research scholar (postdoc) positions has steadily increased in the last 30 years. Postdoc positions are commonly thought of as a step toward academic careers. However, engineering PhDs are more likely to work in industry, which leaves open the question of the role of postdocs in the career trajectories of engineering PhDs. Purpose/hypothesis This study examines the factors associated with attainment of postdocs. It also identifies the influence of postdocs on attainment of tenure-track faculty positions and early career salaries. Design/method Super's "life span, life space" theory informs the analytical approach. Descriptive and regression analyses, and propensity score matching, are conducted using a nationally representative sample of engineering PhDs from the 1993-2013 National Science Foundation Survey of Doctorate Recipients data set merged with the 1985-2013 Survey of Earned Doctorates. Results Engineering PhDs primarily funded by research assistantships and who graduated from a doctoral program with higher-ranked research activities and greater proportions of previous cohorts pursuing postdocs are more likely to attain postdoc positions. Among engineering PhDs, postdoctoral scholars are more likely than PhDs in nonacademic positions to attain tenure-track faculty positions. Early career average salaries are relatively similar between postdoctoral scholars and PhDs without postdoc experiences working in the academic sector. Conclusions Postdoctoral research positions can provide a viable pathway toward careers in the academic sector. Engineering doctoral programs can potentially apply research findings toward student career development and preparation, and engineering students and PhDs can leverage the career outlook information for decision-making and career preparation.

They have attempted to do this by talking to colleagues, by dreaming a little, but mainly by trying to extrapolate the trends they see in society and in present-day geotechnical activity. Although the principal emphasis of Geotechnique tends to be research, this is driven by the requirements of design and construction. Hence, in looking to the future, even the future of research, likely trends in geotechnical construction activities are considered first, particularly noting the emerging importance of energy conservation and carbon dioxide reduction. This leads to discussion of the characterisation of material behaviour and investigation of the ground, and the development of design processes. The future of dissemination of geotechnical information is also discussed.

However, these issues remain an unsolved dilemma for nephrologists. Objective:To explore nephrologists' perceptions on the decision-making process about withholding or withdrawing dialysis and palliative care in Korea. Design:A nationwide 25-item questionnaire online survey via e-mail. Setting/Subjects:A total of 369 Korean nephrologists completed the survey. Results:The proportions of respondents who stated that withholding or withdrawing dialysis at EoL is ethically appropriate were 87.3% and 86.2%, respectively. A total of 72.4% respondents thought that withdrawal of dialysis in a maintenance dialysis patient is ethically appropriate. Responses regarding patient features that should be considered to withhold or withdraw dialysis were as follows: dialysis intolerance (84.3%), poor performance status (74.8%), patient's active request (47.2%), age (28.7%), very severe dementia (27.1%), and several comorbidities (16.5%). Among those nephrologists who responded to the question about the minimum age, at which dialysis should be withheld or withdrawn, most specified an age between 80 and 90 years (94.3%). Fifty-eight percent of respondents stated that terminally ill dialysis patients should be allowed to use palliative care facilities. In addition, a number of nephrologists thought that adequate palliative care facilities, specific treatment guidelines, enough time to manage patients, financial support, and adequate medical experts are necessary. Conclusions:Korean nephrologists thought that withholding or withdrawing dialysis at EoL is ethically appropriate, even in maintenance dialysis patients. Therefore, consensus guidelines for palliative care after withholding or withdrawal of dialysis are needed.

Scholars and practitioners have increasingly advocated that the traditional linear model of knowledge production, with its unidirectional flow of information from researchers to policy-makers, bereplacedbyanewapproachinwhichresearchersand knowledge-users meaningfully interact to co-create knowledge that is actionable in decision-making. This popular model - co-production - has advanced thinking on how to create usable knowledge. In practice, however, co-production has not been a single approach, but instead a diversity of forms of engaged research. Further, the jargon may both obfuscate governance dimensions and limit understanding of what works. Improved distinction among the different ways researchers and societal partners interact can enable attentive and effective engagement across contexts. Recognition of this diversity is necessary in advancing the processes and impacts of actionable knowledge for sustainability.

A comparative analysis of the British Medical Journal and Discover Magazine	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVIDENTIALITY; SMOKING; SCIENCE; HEDGE; SCOPE	Distinguishing certain and uncertain information is of crucial importance both in the scientific field in the strict sense and in the popular scientific domain. In this paper, by adopting an epistemic stance perspective on certainty and uncertainty, and a mixed procedure of analysis, which combines a bottom-up and a top-down approach, we perform a comparative study (both qualitative and quantitative) of the uncertainty linguistic markers (verbs, non-verbs, modal verbs, conditional clauses, uncertain questions, epistemic future) and their scope in three different corpora: a historical corpus of 80 biomedical articles from the British Medical Journal (BMJ) 1840-2007; a corpus of 12 biomedical articles from BMJ 2013, and a contemporary corpus of 12 scientific popular articles from Discover 2013. The variables under observation are time, structure (IMRaD vs no-IMRaD) and genre (scientific vs popular articles). We apply the Generalized Linear Models analysis in order to test whether there are statistically significant differences (1) in the amount of uncertainty among the different corpora, and (2) in the categories of uncertainty markers used by writers. The results of our analysis reveal that (1) in all corpora, the percentages of uncertainty are always much lower than that of certainty; (2) uncertainty progressively diminishes over time in biomedical articles (in conjunction with their structural changes-IMRaD-and to the increase of the BMJ Impact Factor); and (3) uncertainty is slightly higher in scientific popular articles (Discover 2013) as compared to the contemporary corpus of scientific articles (BMJ 2013). Nevertheless, in all corpora, modal verbs are the most used uncertainty markers. These results suggest that not only do scientific writers prefer to communicate their uncertainty with markers of possibility rather than those of subjectivity but also that science journalists prefer using a third-person subject followed by modal verbs rather than a first-person subject followed by mental verbs such as think or believe.

FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						fungal communities; plant assemblage; elevation; 454 pyrosequencing; species distribution models	ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT; MOLECULAR DIVERSITY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; GLOBAL DIVERSITY; HOST DENSITY; PATTERNS; SOIL; COLONIZATION	The distribution of plants along environmental gradients is constrained by abiotic and biotic factors. Cumulative evidence attests of the impact of biotic factors on plant distributions, but only few studies discuss the role of belowground communities. Soil fungi, in particular, are thought to play an important role in how plant species assemble locally into communities. We first review existing evidence, and then test the effect of the number of soil fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) on plant species distributions using a recently collected dataset of plant and metagenomic information on soil fungi in the Western Swiss Alps. Using species distribution models (SDMs), we investigated whether the distribution of individual plant species is correlated to the number of OTUs of two important soil fungal classes known to interact with plants: the Glomeromycetes, that are obligatory symbionts of plants, and the Agaricomycetes, that may be facultative plant symbionts, pathogens, or wood decayers. We show that including the fungal richness information in the models of plant species distributions improves predictive accuracy. Number of fungal OTUs is especially correlated to the distribution of high elevation plant species. We suggest that high elevation soil show greater variation in fungal assemblages that may in turn impact plant turnover among communities. We finally discuss how to move beyond correlative analyses, through the design of field experiments manipulating plant and fungal communities along environmental gradients.

All forms of operative delivery are associated with an increased risk of sepsis, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's guidance recommends the use of prophylactic antibiotics at all caesarean deliveries, based on substantial randomised controlled trial evidence of clinical effectiveness. A Cochrane review, updated in 2017 (Liabsuetrakul T, Choobun T, Peeyananjarassri K, Islam QM. Antibiotic prophylaxis for operative vaginal delivery. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2017;8:CD004455), identified only one small previous trial of prophylactic antibiotics following operative vaginal birth (forceps or ventouse/vacuum extraction) and, given the small study size and extreme result, suggested that further robust evidence is needed. Objective: To investigate whether or not a single dose of prophylactic antibiotic following operative vaginal birth is clinically effective for preventing confirmed or presumed maternal infection, and to investigate the associated impact on health-care costs. Design: A multicentre, randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Twenty-seven maternity units in the UK. Participants: Women who had an operative vaginal birth at >= 36 weeks' gestation, who were not known to be allergic to penicillin or constituents of co-amoxiclav and who had no indication for ongoing antibiotics. Interventions: single dose of intravenous co-amoxiclav (1 g of amoxicillin/200 mg of clavulanic acid) or placebo (sterile saline) allocated through sealed, sequentially numbered, indistinguishable packs. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome - confirmed or suspected infection within 6 weeks of giving birth. Secondary outcomes - severe sepsis, perineal wound infection, perineal pain, use of pain relief, hospital bed stay, hospital/general practitioner visits, need for additional perineal care, dyspareunia, ability to sit comfortably to feed the baby, maternal general health, breastfeeding, wound breakdown, occurrence of anaphylaxis and health-care costs. Results: Between March 2016 and June 2018, 3427 women were randomised: 1719 to the antibiotic arm and 1708 to the placebo arm. Seven women withdrew, leaving 1715 women in the antibiotic arm and 1705 in the placebo arm for analysis. Primary outcome data were available for 3225 out of 3420 women (94.3%). Women randomised to the antibiotic arm were significantly less likely to have confirmed or suspected infection within 6 weeks of giving birth (180/1619, 11 %) than women randomised to the placebo arm (306/1606, 19%) (relative risk 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.69). Three serious adverse events were reported: one in the placebo arm and two in the antibiotic arm (one was thought to be causally related to the intervention). Limitations: The follow-up rate achieved for most secondary outcomes was 76%. Conclusions: This trial has shown clear evidence of benefit of a single intravenous dose of prophylactic co-amoxiclav after operative vaginal birth. These results may lead to reconsideration of official policy/guidance. Further analysis of the mechanism of action of this single dose of antibiotic is needed to investigate whether earlier, pre-delivery or repeated administration could be more effective. Until these analyses are completed, there is no indication for administration of more than a single dose of prophylactic antibiotic, or for pre-delivery administration.

Design Online survey. Women were presented with scenarios on breast and bowel cancer, men with scenarios on prostate and bowel cancer. For each particular cancer, we presented epidemiological information and described the treatment and its consequences. Secondly, we presented two different scenarios of benefit: one indicating a 10% reduction in cancer specific mortality and the second indicating a 50% reduction. Setting Online survey of the population in the United Kingdom. Participants Respondents were part of an existing panel of people who volunteer for online research and were invited by email or online marketing. We recruited 1000 respondents, representative for age and sex for the UK population. Main outcome measures Number of cases of overdetection people were willing to accept, ranging from 0-1000 (complete screened population) for each cancer modality and each scenario of benefit. Results There was large variability between respondents in the level of overdetection they would find acceptable, with medians ranging from 113 to 313 cases of overdetection per 1000 people screened. Across all scenarios, 4-7% of respondents indicated they would accept no overdetection at all compared with 7-14% who thought that it would be acceptable for the entire screened population to be overdetected. Acceptability in screening for bowel cancer was significantly lower than for breast and prostate cancer. People aged 50 or over accepted significantly less overdetection, whereas people with higher education levels accepted more; 29% of respondents had heard of overdetection before. Conclusions Acceptability of overdetection in cancer screening is variable. Invitations for screening should include clear information on the likelihood and consequences of overdetection to allow people to make an informed choice.

Study design Ten unannounced ISS involving all staff were scheduled March-August 2007. Questionnaire surveys on staff perceptions were conducted before (2003-2006) and after (2007-2008) implementation of unannounced ISS. Information from the debriefing sessions following each ISS constituted a proxy measure of the organisational impact of the ISS. Results Five out of ten of the unannounced ISS scheduled were conducted. Twenty-three members of the staff at work on a scheduled day for ISS were randomly selected to participate. Questionnaires before implementation revealed that 137/196 (70%) of staff members agreed or strongly agreed that ISS was a good idea and 52/199 (26%) thought it likely to be stressful and unpleasant. Questionnaires completed after implementation showed significantly more staff members, 135/153 (89%), thought ISS was a good idea. A significantly higher amount of staff members 50/153 (33%) found it to be stressful and unpleasant, and among midwives, 15/59 (25%) were anxious about ISS, whereas none of the obstetricians reported this. Information obtained through debriefing sessions generated learning points. Conclusions The number of staff members with a positive perception of multiprofessional unannounced ISS increased after implementation; however, one-third considered ISS to be stressful and unpleasant and midwives more frequently so. The specific perception of ISS by each healthcare profession should be taken into account when planning ISS. The information from the debriefing sessions showed that implementation of ISS had an impact as it provided information required for organisational changes.

J	Ni, TG; He, CB; Jiang, YZ; Gu, XQ				Ni, Tongguang; He, Chengbing; Jiang, Yizhang; Gu, Xiaoqing			Cross-domain transferable discriminant dictionary based sparse representation approach for EEG emotion-level recognition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article; Early Access						Electroencephalogram; Emotion-level recognition; Transferable discriminant dictionary; Sparse representation		Emotion is usually caused by complex psychological and physiological changes triggered by external stimuli. It is considered one of the abilities to guide one's thinking and action. Emotion-level recognition realizes psychological perception and evaluation by collecting various data characteristics of individual behavior and physiological level, and reversely deriving complex physiological psychological mapping. Emotional Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are not easy to be hidden and forged, and using them for emotion-level recognition has high application value. However, EEG data are often collected in complex environments and scenes, and there are strong time and individual differences in EEG signals. This study proposes a cross-domain transferable discriminant dictionary based sparse representation (CTDDSR) approach for EEG emotion-level recognition. CTDDSR utilizes subspace projection strategy to find a suitable projection subspace. In this subspace, CTDDSR learns the shared dictionary to construct a strong connection between the source and target domains in the framework of dictionary based sparse representation. Different from the traditional projection matrices are completely domain-specific, our projection matrix for each domain is the combination of the domain-specific component and domain-invariable component. The former component is used to retain the individual domain information. By maximizing the cross-domain reconstruction error, the latter component is used to exploit the discriminant knowledge across domains in the shared latent subspace. In addition, to obtain the discriminant dictionary in the subspace, CTDDSR introduces linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to ensure the minimum of the intra-class reconstruction error and the maximum of the inter-class reconstruction error on sparse coding coefficients within each domain. Cross-domain EEG emotion-level recognition experiments are performed on the real EEG emotion dataset and verified that CTDDSR has excellent recognition performance.

J	Audrezet, A; Olsen, SO; Tudoran, AA				Audrezet, Alice; Olsen, Svein Ottar; Tudoran, Ana Alina			The GRID scale: a new tool for measuring service mixed satisfaction	JOURNAL OF SERVICES MARKETING			English	Article						Ambivalence; Evaluative space grid; Indifference; Mixed feelings; Overall service satisfaction measurement; Semantic differential scale	CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; ATTITUDINAL AMBIVALENCE; LOYALTY; QUALITY; MODEL; CONSEQUENCES; INDIFFERENCE; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; REGRESSION	Purpose The purpose of this study is to evaluate a bidimensional tool to measure overall service satisfaction: the evaluative space grid (GRID scale). The GRID scale provides a common measure for both positivity and negativity through 25 grid cells. The authors propose to use the GRID scale as an integrated measure of both satisfaction and dissatisfaction to capture mixed reactions or ambivalence. Design/methodology/approach Within a cross-sectional between-subjects survey design, this study compares overall satisfaction with bank services as measured on the GRID scale versus a traditional semantic differential (SD) scale. Findings The results show that the GRID scale performs as well as the SD scale with respect to different criteria, such as reliability and discriminant, convergent, nomological and predictive validity. However, it allows to measure separately indifference and ambivalence. Practical implications Such a distinction assists decision-makers with recommendations on different strategies not only to create customer loyalty based on satisfaction but also to encourage them to think how to decrease the levels of dissatisfaction and ambivalence. Originality/value - The GRID scale would address survey needs of every business suffering from average performances. This tool provides them better in-depth overall satisfaction information, especially regarding the "middle-ground" customers.

The researchers applied exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to evaluate the constancy of the classified factors and to elucidate relationships among factors in the Digital Fluency Scale. A total of 224 sixth-grade (aged 11-12) elementary school students studying in Taiwan were included in the first sample set for developing the Digital Fluency Scale using EFA to explore its factor structure. The participants of the second sample set using CFA numbered 442 elementary school students. CFA was used to elucidate the relationships among factors in this Digital Fluency Scale, with results indicating that a four-factor digital fluency comprised collaboration and research, digital citizenship, critical thinking and innovation design fit the data well. The Digital Fluency Scale included 15 items; the CFA result supported the four-factor model, with the best fit showing validity and reliability. The students had the highest score in digital citizenship, followed by innovation design, critical thinking, and collaboration and research. Female preadolescents had better digital fluency than male preadolescents.

Arthropods are thought to have two types of ferritin molecules: the secreted type and the cytosolic type. Here, we present the first crystal structure of ferritin from crustacean, kuruma prawn (Marsupenaeus japonicus), at 1.16 angstrom resolution. This shrimp ferritin (MjFer) is the cytosolic type, and its structure shows well-conserved ferritin fold composed of a 4-helix bundle that assembles into a cage-like 24-mer. The structure of MjFer was more similar to those of human and vertebrate ferritins than to that of the secreted-type arthropod ferritin from an insect. MjFer possesses both a ferroxidase site and a nucleation site, which are the main characteristics of vertebrate H and L chain ferritins, respectively. The first crystal structure of crustacean ferritin, MjFer, has exceptionally high quality that provides the detailed structural information of metal moving pathway in ferritin.

J	Yang, Y				Yang, Yan			Application of Mirror Materials in Wood Furniture Manufacturing Process Based on Big Data Analysis	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								With the development of the national economy, the interior decoration work has received extensive attention, and the traditional decoration methods have been unable to meet its actual work needs. The application of mirror materials in interior decoration can not only enrich the technical methods of interior decoration, but also improve the decoration quality and comfort, so as to meet people's growing decoration needs, achieving the purpose of promoting the sound development of interior decoration. Mirror material is one of the decorative materials widely used in modern indoor environment. It not only has decoration, but also can expand space. In recent years, the advent of the era of big data has promoted the reform of the design industry. Using big data thinking to assist the innovative design of furniture products will also become an important trend in the development of the furniture industry. According to the characteristics of customer demand in the era of big data, this paper designs and develops a set of customer demand analysis system based on big data by using cloud computing and big data mining technology. By collecting the behavior data of users when using products, this paper combines the mirror material with the manufacturing process of wooden furniture. The mining algorithm is applied to find out the improvement goal and direction of wood furniture manufacturing process based on mirror material, so as to enhance the competitiveness of furniture enterprises. The method proposed in this paper can obtain the furniture design elements according to the functional zoning and theme information and input the furniture design elements and zoning elements into the design element matching evaluation model to obtain the design matching element information.

J	Pelechrinis, K; Krishnamurthy, P; Weiss, M; Znati, T				Pelechrinis, Konstantinos; Krishnamurthy, Prashant; Weiss, Martin; Znati, Taieb			Cognitive Radio Networks: Realistic or Not?	ACM SIGCOMM COMPUTER COMMUNICATION REVIEW			English	Article						Design; Managemen; Cognitive radio networks; Spectrum sensing; TV bands; Cellular networks		A large volume of research has been conducted in the cognitive radio (CR) area the last decade. However, the deployment of a commercial CR network is yet to emerge. A large portion of the existing literature foes not build on real world scenarios, hence, neglecting various important aspects of commercial telecommunication networks. For instance, a lot of attention has been paid to spectrum sensing as the front line functionality that needs to be completed in an opportunistics CR network architecture. While on the one hand it is necessary to detect the existence of spectrum holes, on the other hand, simply sensing (cooperatively or not) the energy emitted from a primary transmitter cannot enable correct dynamic spectrum access. For example, the presence of a primary transmitter's signal does not mean that CR network users cannot access the spectrum since there might not be any primary receiver in the vicinity. Despite the existing solutions to the DSA problem no robust, implementable scheme has emerged. The set of assumptions that these schemes are built upon do not always hold in realistick, wireless environments. Specific settings are assumed, which differ significantly from how existing telecommunication networks work. In this paper, we challenge the basic premises of the proposed schemes. We further argue that addressing the technical challenges we face in deploying robust CR networks can only be achieved if we radically change the way we design their basic functionalities. In support of our argument, we present a set of real-world scenarios, inspired by realistic settings in commercial telecommunications networks, namely TV and cellular, focusing on spectrum sensing as a basic and critical functionality in the deployment of CRs. We use these scenarios to show why existing DSA paradigms are not amenable to realistic deployment in complex wireless environments. The proposed study extends beyond cognition radio networks, and further highlights the often existing gap between research and commercialization, paving the way to new thinking about how to accelerate commercialization and adoption to new networking technologies and services	[Pelechrinis, Konstantinos; Krishnamurthy, Prashant; Weiss, Martin; Znati, Taieb] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA	Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh	Pelechrinis, K (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.	kpele@pitt.edu; prashant@sis.pitt.edu; mbw@pitt.edu; znati@cs.pitt.edu	Pelechrinis, Konstantinos/ACX-4835-2022; Weiss, Martin/G-5177-2015	Pelechrinis, Konstantinos/0000-0002-6443-3935; Weiss, Martin/0000-0001-6785-0913	NSF [1247546]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems [1247546] Funding Source: National Science Foundation	NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE))	This work was supported in part by NSF Grant 1247546.		26	9	9	0	6	ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY	NEW YORK	2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA	0146-4833	1943-5819		ACM SIGCOMM COMP COM	ACM SIGCOMM Comp.

The burden of non-communicable diseases particularly, hypertension parallels with the increase in age. Although hypertension screening is thought to be an effective indicator of overall health status and paves the way for early interventions in peoples living with human immune virus, the exact prevalence of hypertension in this population remained unknown. We aimed to report the prevalence of hypertension and examine the factors associated with hypertension among people living with human immune virus in East Africa.MethodsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar databases for studies published until January 1, 2023. The search period was from January 10/2023, to February 10/ 2023. Random-effect models were used to calculate the pooled prevalence of hypertension. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore potential heterogeneity. The Funnel plot and Egger's test were used to assess publication bias.ResultA total of 15 studies with 10,916 individuals were included in the present meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of hypertension among people living with human immune virus was19.75% (95% CI, 16.07%-23.42%)),). The prevalence of hypertension was not differed between studies conducted 2014- 2019 and, studies conducted 2020-2022. The prevalence of hypertension was lowest in Ethiopia (16.13%) and highest in Tanzania (26.76%). Alcohol consumption (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 3.39, 95% CI: 2.35-4.43), diabetes (AOR: 2.64, 95% CI: 1.89-3.39), longer duration of HIV (AOR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.15-2.3), male sex (AOR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.43-1.8), obesity (AOR: 2.89, 95% CI: 1.94-3.84), and older age (AOR: 2.25, 95% CI: 2.0-2.5), were the factors associated with the presence of hypertension in people living with human immune virus.ConclusionOur study shows that one in five peoples living with human immune virus have hypertension causing symptoms and impairment, therefore requiring treatment. Designing effective health screening and hypertension management intervention programs helps to prevent the occurrence of hypertension and promotes peoples' overall quality of life.

We aimed to identify COVID-19 vaccine intentions, factors associated with uptake and information needs for healthcare workers in Victoria, Australia. We administered a cross-sectional online survey to healthcare workers in hospitals, primary care and aged or disability care settings (12 February-26 March 2021). The World Health Organization Behavioural and Social Drivers of COVID-19 vaccination framework informed survey design and framing of results. Binary regression results adjusted for demographics provide risk differences between those intending and not intending to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. In total, 3074 healthcare workers completed the survey. Primary care healthcare workers reported the highest intention to accept a COVID-19 vaccine (84%, 755/898), followed by hospital-based (77%, 1396/1811) and aged care workers (67%, 243/365). A higher proportion of aged care workers were concerned about passing COVID-19 to their patients compared to those working in primary care or hospitals. Only 25% felt they had sufficient information across five vaccine topics, but those with sufficient information had higher vaccine intentions. Approximately half thought vaccines should be mandated. Despite current high vaccine rates, our results remain relevant for booster programs and future vaccination rollouts.

Studies across gender and racial/ethnic groups have found varying risk factors associated with STI positivity. Understanding how risk factors are associated with STI positivity can help design interventions for those most at risk. Methods Participants were Native American binge substance using adults enrolled in a randomized controlled trial evaluating a brief intervention to increase STI screening and reduce sexual risk-taking behaviors. Participants completed a self-report assessment at baseline that included questions about sexual risk factors and STI testing behaviors and diagnosis. This analysis includes those who had ever completed an STI test at baseline. Bivariate and multivariate analyses using logistical regression were utilized to identify associations between risk factors and past STI diagnosis. Results A total of 193 people were included in the analysis. Over half (50.6%) of the participants had ever been diagnosed with an STI. Risk behaviors varied by gender. More women with a self-reported history of STI reported having sex with someone they thought had an STI, past experience of physical/sexual violence, and having passed out from drinking. Men with a self-reported history of STI were more likely to report past marijuana and other drug use. Among women with a self-reported history of STI, having sex with someone they thought had an STI was associated with STI positivity, whereas other drug use was associated with STI positivity among men with a self-reported history of STI. Conclusions Findings provide information for those working to reduce STIs in Native Communities to better identify and design programs for those at highest risk for STIs. Additional studies examining gender dynamics and sexual risk taking among native adults are warranted.

Patient decision aid (PDA) is a new tool in Malaysia. Patients' and health-care professionals' (HCPs) expectation of a PDA is unknown. AimWe aimed to explore patients' and health-care professionals'(HCPs) views on the information needed in a patient decision aid (PDA) on insulin initiation developed for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). DesignWe used a qualitative design and thematic approach. SettingThree main primary health-care settings in Malaysia: public university-based primary care clinics, public health-care clinics and private general practices. MethodWe conducted focus groups and one-to-one interviews with a purposive sample of health professionals and patients with type 2 diabetes. ResultsWe interviewed 18 patients and 13 HCPs. Patients viewed the content of the PDA as simple and clear. However, HCPs felt the PDA might be difficult for patients with low literacy to understand. HCPs thought the PDA was too lengthy. Nevertheless, patients would prefer more information. HCPs tended to focus on benefits of insulin, while patients wanted to know the impact of insulin on their quality of life and practical issues regarding insulin and its side-effects. Patients preferred numbers to weigh the risks and benefits of treatment options. HCPs' views that presenting numbers in a PDA would be too complex for patients to understand. ConclusionIt is important to consider including issues related to psycho-social impact of treatment to patients when developing a patient decision aid.

J	Fiori, M; Ortony, A				Fiori, Marina; Ortony, Andrew			Initial Evidence for the Hypersensitivity Hypothesis: Emotional Intelligence as a Magnifier of Emotional Experience	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						hypersensitivity; emotional intelligence; ability EI; social perception; amplification of emotions; emotion understanding	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; COGNITIVE-ABILITY; PERSONALITY; STRESS	In this article, we provide preliminary evidence for the 'hypersensitivity hypothesis', according to which Emotional Intelligence (EI) functions as a magnifier of emotional experience, enhancing the effect of emotion and emotion information on thinking and social perception. Measuring ability EI, and in particular Emotion Understanding, we describe an experiment designed to determine whether, relative to those low in EI, individuals high in EI were more affected by the valence of a scenario describing a target when making an affective social judgment. Employing a sample of individuals from the general population, high EI participants were found to provide more extreme (positive or negative) impressions of the target as a function of the scenario valence: positive information about the target increased high EI participants' positive impressions more than it increased low EI participants' impressions, and negative information increased their negative impressions more. In addition, EI affected the amount of recalled information and this led high EI individuals to intensify their affective ratings of the target. These initial results show that individuals high on EI may be particularly sensitive to emotions and emotion information, and they suggest that this hypersensitivity might account for both the beneficial and detrimental effects of EI documented in the literature. Implications are discussed.

J	Masingila, JO; Olanoff, D				Masingila, Joanna O.; Olanoff, Dana			Who teaches mathematics content courses for prospective elementary teachers in the USA? Results of a second national survey	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Prospective elementary teachers; Mathematics content courses; Mathematics teacher educators		This article reports on a second national survey of higher education institutions in the USA to answer the question "Who teaches mathematics content courses for prospective elementary teachers, and what are these instructors' academic and teaching backgrounds?" and addresses valuable information not collected with the first survey conducted in 2010. We surveyed 1740 institutions and a faculty member from each of 413 institutions (23.7%) participated in the survey. The survey results demonstrate that the majority of these institutions are not meeting the recommendations of the Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences (2012) and the Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators (2017) for prospective elementary teachers to take at least 12 semester-hour credits of mathematics content designed specifically for them. The data do indicate that there is movement toward more activity-based approaches for these courses as compared to the 2010 survey. Additionally, there is an increase in these courses having instructors with doctorates in mathematics education as well as an increase in instructors having grades 7-12 teaching experience. Most instructors for these courses do not have elementary teaching experience and have likely not had opportunities to think deeply about the important ideas in elementary mathematics. While most institutions still do not provide training and/or support for these instructors, formalized support and training appear to be increasing since the 2010 survey.

Previous studies have suggested that black women may be less likely than white women to be offered and to take hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Thus, race and other factors associated with physician recommendation of HRT that may influence women's decisions about HRT were examined. Methods. Data were from a baseline assessment of participants in a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of a tailored decision-aid on HRT decision-making. We telephone interviewed 581 Durham women ages 45-54. The association of race and other factors with reported physician recommendation of HRT was tested using 11 and logistic regression analysis. Results. Overall, 45% of women surveyed reported that their physician recommended HRT; black women were significantly less likely than white women to report being advised about HRT (35% vs 48%, respectively, P<0.005). Additional factors associated with being recommended HRT included older age, being postmenopausal, having had a hysterectomy, having thought about the benefits of HRT, and being satisfied with information about HRT. Conclusions. Black women are less likely than white women to receive physician recommendation of RRT. Racial differences in patient-provider communication about HRT exist and thus require greater diligence on the part of health care providers to minimize such a gap.

J	Grunkemeier, GL; Payne, N				Grunkemeier, GL; Payne, N			Bayesian analysis: A new statistical paradigm for new technology	ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY			English	Article							CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; METAANALYSIS; TRIALS	Full Bayesian analysis is an alternative statistical paradigm, as opposed to traditionally used methods, usually called frequentist statistics. Bayesian analysis is controversial because it requires assuming a prior distribution, which can be arbitrarily chosen; thus there is a subjective element, which is considered to be a major weakness. However, this could also be considered a strength since it provides a formal way of incorporating prior knowledge. Since it is flexible and permits repeated looks at evolving data, Bayesian analysis is particularly well suited to the evaluation of new medical technology. Bayesian analysis can refer to a range of things: from a simple, noncontroversial formula for inverting probabilities to an alternative approach to the philosophy of science. Its advantages include: (1) providing direct probability statements-which are what most people wrongly assume they are getting from conventional statistics; (2) formally incorporating previous information in statistical inference of a data set, a natural approach which we follow in everyday reasoning; and (3) flexible, adaptive research designs allowing multiple looks at accumulating study data. Its primary disadvantage is the element of subjectivity which some think is not scientific. We discuss and compare frequentist and Bayesian approaches and provide three examples of Bayesian analysis: (1) EKG interpretation, (2) a coin-tossing experiment, and (3) assessing the thromboembolic risk of a new mechanical heart valve.

Color-coded corneal maps produced by computer-assisted videokeratographers (CAVKs) have become an indispensable tool for clinical understanding of corneal shape. However, Placido-based CAVKs are criticized as theoretically incapable of producing accurate corneal height information. Purpose. This paper describes how the Keratron (Optikon 2000, Rome, Italy) integrated design innovations to achieve accuracy and map use previously thought to be unobtainable. Methods. The Keratron implemented a spherically unbiased surface reconstruction method that yields height, axial power, and instantaneous curvature without derivation of one quantity from another. Processing innovations resulted in sub-micron height accuracy. The Keratron includes axial power, instantaneous curvature, refractive maps, a height map (spherical offset), pupil edge detection, a ''move axis'' feature, process editing, indices, a contact lens program, and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) simulation. Conclusions. The algorithms for surface reconstruction and the design solutions implemented in the Keratron resulted in accurate height, axial power, and instantaneous curvature measurement and valid, clinically useful maps, as well as additional user options and features.

Investigating the ease-of-retrieval effect in an eyewitness context	MEMORY			English	Article						Ease-of-retrieval; eyewitness memory; identification confidence; lineups; recognition memory	CONFIDENCE-ACCURACY RELATIONSHIP; ACCESSIBILITY EXPERIENCES; IDENTIFICATION; MODEL; AVAILABILITY; INFORMATION; SIMILARITY; JUDGMENTS; FEEDBACK; NEED	The way in which individuals think about their own cognitive processes plays an important role in various domains. When eyewitnesses assess their confidence in identification decisions, they could be influenced by how easily relevant information comes to mind. This ease-of-retrieval effect has a robust influence on people's cognitions in a variety of contexts (e.g., attitudes), but it has not yet been applied to eyewitness decisions. In three studies, we explored whether the ease with which eyewitnesses recall certain memorial information influenced their identification confidence assessments and related testimony-relevant judgements (e.g., perceived quality of view). We manipulated the number of reasons participants gave to justify their identification (Study 1; N = 343), and also the number of instances they provided of a weak or strong memory (Studies 2a & 2b; Ns = 350 & 312, respectively). Across the three studies, ease-of-retrieval did not affect eyewitnesses' confidence or other testimony-relevant judgements. We then tried - and failed - to replicate Schwarz, N., Bless, H., Strack, F., Klumpp, G., Rittenauer-Schatka, H., & Simons, A. (1991. Ease of retrieval as information: Another look at the availability heuristic. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 61(2), 195-202. doi:) original ease-of-retrieval finding (Study 3; N = 661). In three of the four studies, ease-of-retrieval had the expected effect on participants' perceived task difficulty; however, frequentist and Bayesian testing showed no evidence for an effect on confidence or assertiveness ratings.

J	Toro, SO				Toro, Sonia Osorio			Experimental Practice of Dissection and 3D Modeling of the Middle and Inner Ear for the Development of Increased Knowledge of Human Anatomy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY			Spanish	Article						Ear; Anatomy; Dissection	EDUCATION	Understanding human anatomy, and especially some very small organs such as the middle and inner ear, is challenging due to their complex three-dimensional structure. To build knowledge in understanding of anatomy, of the human inner and middle ear, from the 3D modeling and dissection experiment. Using DICOM images from a computerized axial tomography of the human ear converted to a 3D model (Mimics) and cadaveric dissections of the temporal bone, the bony and soft structures of the external, middle, and internal ear were designed, using organic modeling software. A standard operating protocol, 3D modeling of the middle and inner ear and 3D printing of the structures was created, differentiating each one by color. In this case, the dissection and modeling of the anatomical pieces was fundamental in the teaching and learning of this area of science, allowing expanded knowledge from the search for information, observation, analysis and reflection. The students showed fascination and deep learning in the practice carried out. The construction of explanatory models around qualitative experimentation allows an in-depth understanding of the different phenomena. The experimental activity overcomes the demonstration and facilitates thought process. The students achieve and in depth understanding of the middle and inner ear anatomy, acquired surgical skills, proposed and analyzed projects that allowed them to participate in academic event. They have also acquired additional skills, such as the comprehensive use of scientific knowledge.

The software helps readers create a graphic organizer from the text as a knowledge map while they are reading and use their prior knowledge to build their own opinion as new information while they think about writing their essays. Readers using this software can read a text, underline important words or sentences, pick up and dynamically cite the underlined portions of the text onto a knowledge map as quotation nodes, illustrate a knowledge map by linking the nodes, and later write their opinion as an essay while viewing the knowledge map; thus, the software bridges argumentative reading and writing. Sixty-three freshman and sophomore students with no prior argumentative reading and writing education participated in a design case study to evaluate the software in classrooms. Thirty-four students were assigned to a class in which each student developed a knowledge map after underlining and/or highlighting a text with the software, while twenty-nine students were assigned to a class in which they simply wrote their essays after underlining and/or highlighting the text without creating knowledge maps. After receiving an instruction regarding a simplified Toulmin's model followed by instructions for the software usage in argumentative reading and writing along with reading one training text, the students read the target text and developed their essays. The results revealed that students who drew a knowledge map based on the underlining and/or highlighting of the target text developed more argumentative essays than those who did not draw maps. Further analyses revealed that developing knowledge maps fostered an ability to capture the target text's argument, and linking students' ideas to the text's argument directly on the knowledge map helped students develop more constructive essays. Accordingly, we discussed additional necessary scaffolds, such as automatic argument detection and collaborative learning functions, for improving the students' use of appropriate reading and writing strategies.

Cost-related medication nonadherence in Canada: a systematic review of prevalence, predictors, and clinical impact	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						Medication adherence; Medication costs; Canada; Systematic review	ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; PRESCRIPTION NONADHERENCE; OLDER PATIENTS; UNITED-STATES; ADHERENCE; CARE; MEDICINES; COVERAGE; THERAPY; AFFORDABILITY	Background: Cost-related nonadherence to medications (CRNA) is common in many countries and thought to be associated with adverse outcomes. The characteristics of CRNA in Canada, with its patchwork coverage of increasingly expensive medications, are unclear. Objectives: Our objective in this systematic review was to summarize the literature evaluating CRNA in Canada in three domains: prevalence, predictors, and effect on clinical outcomes. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library from 1992 to December 2019 using search terms covering medication adherence, costs, and Canada. Eligible studies, without restriction on design, had to have original data on at least one of the three domains specifically for Canadian participants. Articles were identified and reviewed in duplicate. Risk of bias was assessed using design-specific tools. Results: Twenty-six studies of varying quality (n = 483,065 Canadians) were eligible for inclusion. Sixteen studies reported on the overall prevalence of CRNA, with population-based estimates ranging from 5.1 to 10.2%. Factors predicting CRNA included high out-of-pocket spending, low income or financial flexibility, lack of drug insurance, younger age, and poorer health. A single randomized trial of free essential medications with free delivery in Ontario improved adherence but did not find any change in clinical outcomes at 1 year. Conclusion: CRNA affects many Canadians. The estimated percentage depends on the sampling frame, the main predictors tend to be financial, and its association with clinical outcomes in Canada remains unproven.

But now there is not an effective multimodal mode to solve the problem for children's storytelling systems. In this paper, we propose a multimodal fusion framework that utilizes pen and speech techniques to incorporate both context information and linguistic attributes of the Chinese language into the design. Based on the proposed framework, we formulated specific methods of integration, and developed a prototype for our proposed system.

Perspectives of people living with Parkinson's disease on personalized prediction models	HEALTH EXPECTATIONS			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; patients' perspective; personalized prediction model	PATIENT; VALIDATION; INTERVIEWS	Background There is a great need for the development of personalized prediction models (PPMs) that can predict the rate of disease progression for persons with Parkinson's disease (PD), based on their individual characteristics. In this study, we aimed to clarify the perspective of persons diagnosed with PD on the value of such hypothetical PPMs. Methods We organized four focus group discussions, each including five persons with PD who were diagnosed within the last 5 years. The sessions focused on what they think of receiving a personalized prediction; what outcomes are important to them; if and how the possibility of influencing the prognosis would change the way they think of personalized predictions; how they deal with the uncertainty from a PPM; and what barriers and facilitators they expect for using a PPM. Results The wish of persons with PD for receiving personalized prognostic information was highly heterogenous, for various reasons. Most persons with PD would like to receive more personalized prognostic information, mainly to better prepare themselves and their loved ones for the future. The prediction provided should be as personalized as possible, and there should be adequate supervision and coaching by a professional when providing the information. They were particularly interested in receiving prognostic information when their interventions would be available that could subsequently influence the identified prognostic factor and thereby affect the disease course beneficially. Conclusion Most persons with PD in this study want more insight into their own future by means of prediction models, provided that this is explained and supervized properly by professionals. Patient or Public Contribution Two patient-researchers were involved in the study design, conduct of the study, interpretation of the data and in preparation of the manuscript.

J	Zheng, WF; Liu, XJ; Yin, LR				Zheng, Wenfeng; Liu, Xiangjun; Yin, Lirong			Sentence Representation Method Based on Multi-Layer Semantic Network	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						semantics; sentence representation; natural language reasoning; multi-layer network; multi-attention mechanism		With the development of artificial intelligence, more and more people hope that computers can understand human language through natural language technology, learn to think like human beings, and finally replace human beings to complete the highly difficult tasks with cognitive ability. As the key technology of natural language understanding, sentence representation reasoning technology mainly focuses on the sentence representation method and the reasoning model. Although the performance has been improved, there are still some problems such as incomplete sentence semantic expression, lack of depth of reasoning model, and lack of interpretability of the reasoning process. In this paper, a multi-layer semantic representation network is designed for sentence representation. The multi-attention mechanism obtains the semantic information of different levels of a sentence. The word order information of the sentence is also integrated by adding the relative position mask between words to reduce the uncertainty caused by word order. Finally, the method is verified on the task of text implication recognition and emotion classification. The experimental results show that the multi-layer semantic representation network can promote sentence representation's accuracy and comprehensiveness.

As knowledge of the complex processes that enable sperm to fertilize eggs has increased, it has become clearer that quantitative estimation of the fertilizing potential of a sire or an ejaculate is actually unlikely ever to be fully realized. Here, we propose that a better approach is to identify substandard males and semen samples. During the past decades, the use of fluorescence technologies in biomedical science has burgeoned, with the development of very powerful instrumentation such as confocal microscopy and flow cytometers of ever-increasing capabilities together with a vast range of fluorochromes and fluorochrome conjugates. This technology has been applied to andrology but thus far in only a relatively simple way. In this review, we offer strategies for assessing a large range of sperm functions thought to be related to fertilizing ability over a temporal window rather than at a single time point. From such an assessment profile, sperm samples that over-respond or do not respond sufficiently could be identified, termed dysfunctional and rejected. We outline the rationales behind such tests, present information on new potentially useful fluorochromes and current flow cytometer models that would be suitable for the multicolour multifunctional tests we propose, and we offer suggestions as to how andrologists might design such multicolour tests for themselves.

Why people matter in ocean governance: Incorporating human dimensions into large-scale marine protected areas	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Large-scale marine protected areas; Marine conservation; Marine protected areas; Human dimensions of conservation; Conservation social science; Knowledge co-production	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; DANGEROUS TARGETS; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION; CHALLENGES; RESERVES; PROGRESS; OUTCOMES; IMPACTS	Large-scale marine protected areas (LSMPAs) are rapidly increasing. Due to their sheer size, complex sociopolitical realities, and distinct local cultural perspectives and economic needs, implementing and managing LSMPAs successfully creates a number of human dimensions challenges. It is timely and important to explore the human dimensions of LSMPAs. This paper draws on the results of a global "Think Tank on the Human Dimensions of Large Scale Marine Protected Areas" involving 125 people from 17 countries, including representatives from government agencies, non-governmental organizations, academia, professionals, industry, cultural/indigenous leaders and LSMPA site managers. The overarching goal of this effort was to be proactive in understanding the issues and developing best management practices and a research agenda that address the human dimensions of LSMPAs. Identified best management practices for the human dimensions of LSMPAs included: integration of culture and traditions, effective public and stakeholder engagement, maintenance of livelihoods and wellbeing, promotion of economic sustainability, conflict management and resolution, transparency and matching institutions, legitimate and appropriate governance, and social justice and empowerment. A shared human dimensions research agenda was developed that included priority topics under the themes of scoping human dimensions, governance, politics, social and economic outcomes, and culture and tradition. The authors discuss future directions in researching and incorporating human dimensions into LSMPAs design and management, reflect on this global effort to co-produce knowledge and re-orient practice on the human dimensions of LSMPAs, and invite others to join a nascent community of practice on the human dimensions of large-scale marine conservation.

Human-centered recommender systems: Origins, advances, challenges, and opportunities	AI MAGAZINE			English	Article							INFORMATION	From the earliest days of the field, Recommender Systems research and practice has struggled to balance and integrate approaches that focus on recommendation as a machine learning or missing-value problem with ones that focus on machine learning as a discovery tool and perhaps persuasion platform. In this article, we review 25 years of recommender systems research from a human-centered perspective, looking at the interface and algorithm studies that advanced our understanding of how system designs can be tailored to users objectives and needs. At the same time, we show how external factors, including commercialization and technology developments, have shaped research on human-centered recommender systems. We show how several unifying frameworks have helped developers and researchers alike incorporate thinking about user experience and human decision-making into their designs. We then review the challenges, and the opportunities, in today's recommenders, looking at how deep learning and optimization techniques can integrate with both interface designs and human performance statistics to improve recommender effectiveness and usefulness	[Konstan, Joseph A.; Terveen, Loren G.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Grp Lens Res Grp, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA	University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities	Konstan, JA (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, 4-192 Keller Hall, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.	konstan@umn.edu							56	9	9	3	8	AMER ASSOC ARTIFICIAL INTELL	MENLO PK	445 BURGESS DRIVE, MENLO PK, CA 94025-3496 USA	0738-4602	2371-9621		AI MAG	AI Mag.		2021	42	3					31	42		10.1609/aaai.12015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1609/aaai.12015			12	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Computer Science	YJ4AY					2024-01-21	WOS:000744477000004

These difficulties may lead to inadequate calorie intake, which affects a child's nutrition, growth and general physical health. Objective: To examine which interventions are available that can be delivered at home by parents to improve eating, drinking and swallowing in young children with neurodisability and are suitable for investigation in pragmatic trials. Design: This was a mixed-methods study that included focus groups, surveys, an update of published systematic reviews of interventions, a systematic review of measurement properties of existing tools, evidence mapping, evidence synthesis, a Delphi survey and stakeholder workshops. Setting: The study was carried out in NHS hospitals, community services, family homes and schools. Participants: Parents of children who had neurodisability and eating, drinking and swallowing difficulties. Professionals from health and education. Young people with eating, drinking and swallowing difficulties or young people who had previously experienced eating, drinking and swallowing difficulties. Data sources: Literature reviews; national surveys of parents and professionals; focus groups with parents, young people and professionals; and stakeholder consultation workshops. Review methods: An update of published systematic reviews of interventions (searched July-August 2017), a mapping review (searched October 2017) and a systematic review of measurement properties using COnsensus-based Standards for the Selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) methodology (searched May 2018). Results: Significant limitations of the available research evidence regarding interventions and tools to measure outcomes were identified. A total of 947 people participated: 400 parents, 475 health professionals, 62 education professionals and 10 young people. The survey showed the wide range of interventions recommended by NHS health professionals, with parents and professionals reporting variability in the provision of these interventions. Parents and professionals considered 19 interventions as relevant because they modified eating, drinking and swallowing difficulties. Parents and professionals considered 10 outcomes as important to measure (including Nutrition, Growth and Health/safety); young people agreed that these were important outcomes. Stakeholder consultation workshops identified that project conclusions and recommendations made sense, were meaningful and were valued by parents and professionals. Parents and health professionals were positive about a proposed Focus on Early Eating, Drinking and Swallowing (FEEDS) toolkit of interventions that, through shared decision-making, could be recommended by health professionals and delivered by families. Limitations: The national surveys included large numbers of parents and professionals but, as expected, these were not representative of the UK population of parents of children with eating, drinking and swallowing difficulties. Owing to the limitations of research evidence, pragmatic decisions were made about interventions that might be included in future research and outcomes that might be measured. For instance, the reviews of research found only weak or poor evidence to support the effectiveness of interventions. The review of outcome measures found only limited low-level evidence about their psychometric properties. Conclusions: Opportunities and challenges for conducting clinical trials of the effectiveness of the FEEDS toolkit of interventions are described. Parents and professionals thought that implementation of the toolkit as part of usual NHS practice was appropriate. However, this would first require the toolkit to be operationalised through development as a complex intervention, taking account of constituent interventions, delivery strategies, implementation and manualisation. Subsequently, an evaluation of its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness could be undertaken using appropriate research methods. Future work: Initial steps include FEEDS toolkit development and evaluation of its use in clinical practice, and identification of the most robust methods to measure valued outcomes, such as Nutrition and Growth.

J	Elaish, MM; Hussein, MH; Hwang, GJ				Elaish, Monther M.; Hussein, Mahmood H.; Hwang, Gwo-Jen			Critical research trends of mobile technology-supported English language learning: A review of the top 100 highly cited articles	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Review						Mobile learning; Applications in subject areas; Teaching; learning strategies; Pedagogical issues; M-ELL	EFL; SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; PERCEPTIONS; CONTEXT; METAANALYSIS; CONCEPTIONS; EXPERIENCES; STRATEGIES; KNOWLEDGE	Around the world, the number of English speakers and the significance of the English language are constantly increasing. Among various technology-supported instructional styles, Mobile Learning (M-Learning) has been recognized as a promising approach to enhance students' competencies and skills in the English language. By examining previous literature, a number of reviews have been performed to investigate the role of M-learning in the English language. However, none of these studies has highlighted the trends, opportunities, and challenges identified in the most cited articles that focused solely on the English language. Therefore, to address these limitations, this study performed a review of the top 100 most cited articles, published between 2007 and 2020, indexed by the Web of Science, and addressing the English language only. The results revealed that most research in Mobile English Language Learning (M-ELL) followed an experimental design and employed a single mobile learning implementation. Additionally, the current study identified a number of research areas that require additional research attention. For example, further research is needed among students learning from home, more qualitative research is needed, and additional research is required to improve students' higher-order thinking skills. The outcomes of this study provide a reference to researchers and educators who intend to use mobile technologies in the area of language education, especially in the context of the English language.

J	Xu, SX; He, H; Iiu, Z				Xu, Shuxin; He, Hui; Iiu, Zhen			New Promises of Advanced Molecular Recognition: Bioassays, Single Cell Analysis, Cancer Therapy, and Beyond	CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Molecular recognition; Boronate affinity; Molecularly imprinted polymers; Immunoassays; Cancer	FLIGHT MASS-SPECTROMETRY; DIOL-CONTAINING BIOMOLECULES; BORONATE AFFINITY MATERIALS; COPY-NUMBER PROTEINS; SELECTIVE ENRICHMENT; CIS-DIOL; MONOLITHIC CAPILLARY; EFFICIENT ANALYSIS; MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES; TRACE GLYCOPROTEINS	Comprehensive Summary The development of biomimetic affinity materials holds great value for scientific research and practical applications. Starting from boronic acid chemistry, we developed a series of boronate affinity materials (BAMs) with desired binding properties in aspects of binding pH, affinity and selectivity. Based on BAMs, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and aptamers capable of targeting vital biomolecules were rationally designed and prepared. Using these affinity reagents as potent tools and combining with advanced analytical techniques particularly liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and spectrometry allowed for the construction of promising analytical methods to provide new qualitative and quantitative solutions to challenging applications including targeted proteomics analysis, single cell analysis and disease diagnostics. In addition, the targeting capability of these affinity reagents particularly nanoscale MIPs opened a unique access to develop innovative nanotherapeutics for cancer treatment. What is the most favorite and original chemistry developed in your research group? So far, the most favorite and original chemistry developed by us is that HER2-glycan-imprinted nanoparticles could function as an anti-cancer drug through blocking the HER2 signaling pathway and thereby inhibiting the growth of HER2+ breast cancer. How do you get into this specific field? Could you please share some experiences with our readers? Actually, I was not educated and trained to be a scientist for my current research field. During my graduate education and post-doctoral research, separation science, particularly liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis, was the focus of my study and research. After I started my independent research career, I had to do something different from what I was trained and the contributions for which my previous supervisors were well recognized worldwide. I first picked up boronate affinity chromatography, a unique mode of affinity chromatography with great potentials but less explored, to start up. This choice was not because it was hot; rather, because there were many challenges that hamper this technique to be practically useful. Along with solving these issues one by one, I recognized that we need not to go elsewhere since this field is so cool that we can do quite a lot of things different from others. What is the most important personality for scientific research? I believe that persistence is the most important personality for scientific research, because it is the key to success. Albert Einstein once said, "It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer." If you are not smarter than Einstein, think about the chances for you to succeed if you do not persist. What are your hobbies? I love walking, hiking and listening to music. Waling and hiking make me healthy while listening to music drives me into diverse favorite moods, be deep in thought, be passionate, and so on. I am good at whistling. I like to mimick bird singing walking in forest and to blow my favorite tunes when I am alone. Who influences you mostly in your life? In some sense, my dad influenced me mostly in my life. When I was a little boy, he always inspired me to think about things beyond what is seen. Also, via brewing rice wine, he showed me a very basic ideas about chemistry in which the best product quality greatly depended on quantitative conditional optimization. If you have anything else to tell our readers, please feel free to do so. While many readers try their best to catch up strengths and beauties stated in a scientific paper, a good reader, in my own opinion, should keep curiosity to figure out hidden information behind the paper via critical thinking.

The emergence of brain-computer interface technology has brought practical value to many fields. Based on the mechanism and characteristics of motion imaging EEG signals, this paper designs the acquisition experiment of EEG signals. After removing the anomalous samples, the wavelet-reconstruction method is used to extract the specific frequency band of the motion imaging EEG signal. According to the characteristics of motor imagery EEG signals, the feature recognition algorithm of convolutional neural networks is discussed. After an in-depth analysis of the reasons for choosing this algorithm, a variety of different network structures were designed and trained. The optimal network structure is selected by analyzing the experimental results, and the reasons why the structure effect is superior to other structures are analyzed. The results show that the method has a high accuracy rate for the recognition of motor imagery EEG, and it has good robustness.

Polymers as advanced antibacterial and antibiofilm agents for direct and combination therapies	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Review							BACTERIA-TRIGGERED RELEASE; GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA; MULTIDRUG EFFLUX PUMPS; ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES; PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA; INTRINSIC RESISTANCE; QUATERNARY AMMONIUM; NYLON-3 COPOLYMERS; CHEMICAL-STRUCTURE; PHOSPHONIUM	The growing prevalence of antimicrobial drug resistance in pathogenic bacteria is a critical threat to global health. Conventional antibiotics still play a crucial role in treating bacterial infections, but the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant micro-organisms are rapidly eroding their usefulness. Cationic polymers, which target bacterial membranes, are thought to be the last frontier in antibacterial development. This class of molecules possesses several advantages including a low propensity for emergence of resistance and rapid bactericidal effect. This review surveys the structure-activity of advanced antimicrobial cationic polymers, including poly(alpha-amino acids), beta-peptides, polycarbonates, star polymers and main-chain cationic polymers, with low toxicity and high selectivity to potentially become useful for real applications. Their uses as potentiating adjuvants to overcome bacterial membrane-related resistance mechanisms and as antibiofilm agents are also covered. The review is intended to provide valuable information for design and development of cationic polymers as antimicrobial and antibiofilm agents for translational applications.

In this study, we fill this research gap by examining the explanatory power of the think-feel-do hierarchy versus the feel-think-do hierarchy in predicting online purchase intentions towards search versus experience products and high involvement versus low involvement products. Hypotheses are formulated and tested using a quasi-field experiment (n = 198) design. The results show the robustness of the think-feel-do hierarchy for three out of four product types (experience, low involvement, high involvement). Remarkably, the results also demonstrate that the formation of online purchase intentions for search products may occur via a more experiential form of online purchase decision-making. Implications of our findings for theory and online store practitioners are discussed.

Dried blood spot samples for drug monitoring can be collected by parents at home as an alternative to traditional sampling. This mixed-method study aimed to understand the parents' perspectives on blood self-sampling from their children and to identify factors contributing to successful sampling. Method Parents who had collected a sample from their child during a visit to the neuropediatric clinic were asked to fill in a questionnaire. To get in-depth information and individual perspectives, parents and nurses participated in semi-structured interviews and analysed with thematic analysis. Results The results from questionnaires (n = 64) and interviews (n = 9) were interpreted together. Watching an instruction video and practical training contributed to successful sampling. 97% of the parents managed to collect a sample, 72% thought it was easy to perform, and 80% found self-sampling at home desirable. Factors for success were as follows: high motivation, prepared parents with pre-understanding, a pragmatic attitude, flexible education, effective communication and willingness to take on the role as a performer. Risk factors were as follows: conflict, fear, unprepared parents, confused or worried children. Conclusion Voluntary self-sampling at home for parents of children with epilepsy is feasible and can reduce stress factors in everyday life.

Sex steroid priming for growth hormone stimulation testing in children and adolescents with short stature: A systematic review	CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Review						children; growth hormone; insulin tolerance test; oestrogen; peripuberty; sex steroid; testosterone	PROVOCATIVE TESTS; GH DEFICIENCY; TESTOSTERONE; ESTROGEN; CHILDHOOD; SECRETION; BOYS; DIAGNOSIS; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT	ObjectiveGrowth hormone stimulation testing (GHST) is used to diagnose growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in children. As sex steroids impact on anterior pituitary function, there is concern around the efficacy of GHST in peripubertal children, where endogenous sex steroid levels are low. Sex steroid priming before GHST is thought to improve test efficacy in these children, however evidence to support its use in clinical practice is limited. In this systematic review, we addressed the following research questions: Does priming increase GH stimulation test efficacy in peripubertal children? Does priming identify those who would benefit most from treatment in terms of final height? Is there evidence for an optimal sex-steroid priming regimen? Design, Patients, MeasurementsThe study was registered with PROSPERO and conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. We searched Medline, Cochrane-Library, Scopus, EMBASE and Web-of-Science and included all studies that included GHST in both primed and unprimed children. A GH cut-off of 7 mu g/L was used as a threshold for GHD. Study quality was assessed using the Risk-Of-Bias in Non- Randomized Studies (ROBINS-I) tool or the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for Randomised trials. ResultsFifteen studies met our inclusion criteria, of which 4/15 (27%) were randomised control trials. The majority (9/15) of the studies indicated that priming increases growth hormone response upon GHST in peripubertal children, increasing test specificity. Two studies investigated final height after treatment based on the results of primed versus unprimed GHST. These results indicate that growth hormone treatment based on results of a primed GHST improve outcomes compared with treatment based on an unprimed test. ConclusionSex-steroid priming increases the growth hormone response during GHST, resulting in fewer patients meeting the threshold required for a diagnosis of GHD. Unnecessary GH treatment may be avoided in some patients without a detrimental effect on final height. Numerous sex-steroid priming regimens have been used in clinical practice and the majority appear to be effective, but an optimal regimen has not been determined.

Recent meta-analyses have compared the incidence of secondary vertebral fractures between patients treated with vertebral augmentation techniques or conservative treatment; however, the inclusions were not thorough and rigorous enough, and the effects of each technique on the incidence of secondary vertebral fractures remain unclear. Purpose: To perform an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of the studies with more rigorous inclusion criteria on the effects of vertebral augmentation techniques and conservative treatment for OVCF on the incidence of secondary vertebral fractures. Material and Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, SpringerLink, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library database were searched for relevant original articles comparing the incidence of secondary vertebral fractures between vertebral augmentation techniques and conservative treatment for patients with OVCFs. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs) were identified. The methodological qualities of the studies were evaluated, relevant data were extracted and recorded, and an appropriate meta-analysis was conducted. Results: A total of 13 articles were included. The pooled results from included studies showed no statistically significant differences in the incidence of secondary vertebral fractures between patients treated with vertebral augmentation techniques and conservative treatment. Subgroup analysis comparing different study designs, durations of symptoms, follow-up times, races of patients, and techniques were conducted, and no significant differences in the incidence of secondary fractures were identified (P > 0.05). No obvious publication bias was detected by either Begg's test (P = 0.360 > 0.05) or Egger's test (P = 0.373 > 0.05). Conclusion: Despite current thinking in the field that vertebral augmentation procedures may increase the incidence of secondary fractures, we found no differences in the incidence of secondary fractures between vertebral augmentation techniques and conservative treatment for patients with OVCFs.

J	Klar, RM				Klar, Roland M.			The Induction of Bone Formation: The Translation Enigma	FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Review								A paradigmatic shift in the way of thinking is what bone tissue engineering science requires to decrypt the translation conundrum from animal models into human. The deductive work of Urist (1965), who discerned the principle of bone induction from the pioneering works of Senn, Huggins, Lacroix, Levander, and other bone regenerative scientists, provided the basis that has assisted future bone tissue regenerative scientists to extend the bone tissue engineering field and its potential uses for bone regenerative medicine in humans. However, major challenges remain that are preventing the formation of bone by induction clinically. Growing experimental evidence is indicating that bone inductive studies are non-translatable from animal models into a clinical environment. This is preventing bone tissue engineering from reaching the next phase in development. Countless studies are trying to discern how the formation of bone by induction functions mechanistically, so as to try and solve this enigmatic problem. However, are the correct questions being asked? Why do bone inductive animal studies not translate into humans? Why do bone induction principles not yield the same extent of bone formation as an autogenous bone graft? What are bone tissue engineering scientists missing? By critically re-assessing the past and present discoveries of the bone induction field, this review article attempts to re-discover the field of bone formation by induction, identifying some key features that may have been missed. These include a detailed library of all proteins in bones and their arrangement in the 3D superstructure of the bone together with some other important criteria not considered by tissue engineering scientists. The review therefore not only re-iterates possible avenues of research that need to be re-explored but also seeks to guide present and future scientists in how they assess their own research in light of experimental design and results. By addressing these issues bone formation by induction without autografts might finally become clinically viable.

New directions in computational, combinational and structural creativity	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Morphological analysis; creativity; idea generation; data analysis; artificial intelligence		This paper examines how new and creative relationships in datasets, not easily revealed by conventional information retrieval methods and technologies, can be identified using a mix of established and new methods. The authors present how the integration of computerised morphological analysis with new computational models, incorporating web crawler, data processing networking and data mining algorithms, can help facilitate the identification of new ideas. Boden's concept of 'Combinational Creativity' indicates a structured process, which generates unfamiliar combinations of familiar concepts and constructs allowing creative styles of thought. This structured approach has been constrained by the resultant combinatorial explosion and the dearth of easily accessible computer software and supporting methodologies, to help identify viable new solutions. Feature-enhanced computerised morphological analysis provides a new structural support tool for creativity and innovation. Morphological analysis systematically structures and examines all the possible relationships in a multidimensional, highly complex, usually non-quantifiable problem space. Computerisation of the process now permits large number of configurations (millions) in the problem space to be majorly reduced (typically > 95%), identifying only internally consistent solutions. These solutions are likely to embrace configurations containing something, which has not previously been considered, thus increasing the probability of some form of technological or design breakthrough and hence truly creative.

As the fast growing of the clinical trials of targeted anticancer agents for different cancer types, it is critical to collect and integrate such information to guide clinical practice. Methods: We constructed the Cancer Molecular Targeted Therapy database (CMTTdb) to store and retrieve molecular targeted therapy data about randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of targeted agents and also accompanied targets, biomarkers, targeted cancer subtypes, etc. Results: Different with some existing resources, CMTTdb particularly focuses on clinical application of the trails. Design of the trails, such as treatment modalities (monotherapy or combination with other therapies), as well as results on clinical efficacy parameters, adverse events are also collected. In this current version, CMTTdb contains data for 1,088 clinical trials which cover 165 agents, 80 targets, 15 cancer types (95 molecular subtypes and 56 histological or cytological subtypes) from public literatures. This database is freely available at http://www.biosino.org/CMTTdb. A user-friendly web interface was designed so that these data can be easily retrieved. Conclusions: CMTTdb will be a valuable source for providing access to information of clinical trials on the rapidly growing number of novel targeted agent and be useful in guiding oncologists for the optimization of the therapy strategy for cancer treatment.

Whether and where this distinction is represented at the neural level is still a matter of considerable debate. In the present fMRI study, we examined the neural correlates of syntactic and semantic functions using an innovative activation paradigm specifically designed to unequivocally disentangle syntactic from lexicosemantic aspects of sentence processing. Our findings strongly indicate that a part of Broca's area (BA 44, pars opercularis) is critically implicated in processing syntactic information, whereas the lower portion of the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47, pars orbitalis) is selectively involved in processing the semantic aspects of a sentence.

Breast Cancer Surgery Decision-Making and African-American Women	JOURNAL OF CANCER EDUCATION			English	Article						Breast cancer; Treatment; Decision-making; Survivorship; Qualitative; African-American; Focus group	INFORMED-CONSENT; INFORMATION; SURVIVORS; INVOLVEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; PROGRAM	Prior research has used focus group methodology to investigate cultural factors impacting the breast cancer experience of women of various ethnicities including African-Americans; however, this work has not specifically addressed treatment decision-making. This study identifies key issues faced by African-American women diagnosed with breast cancer regarding treatment decisions. We used an interpretive-descriptive study design based on qualitative data from three focus groups (n = 14) representing a population of African-American women in central Pennsylvania. Participants were asked to think back to when they were diagnosed with breast cancer and their visit with the breast surgeon. Questions were asked about the actual visit, treatment choices offered, sources of information, and whether the women felt prepared for the surgery and subsequent treatments. The prompts triggered memories and encouraged open discussion. The most important themes identified were fear across the breast cancer disease trajectory, a preference for visual information for understanding the diagnosis and surgical treatment, and support systems relying on family and friends, rather than the formal health-care system. Our results have implications for practice strategies and development of educational interventions that will help breast cancer patients better understand their diagnosis and treatment options, encourage their participation in treatment decision-making, and provide psychosocial support for those at high risk for emotional distress.

In these cellular events, the induction of local changes in membrane curvature often plays a pivotal role. Many amphiphilic peptides are able to modulate membrane curvature, but there is little information on specific structural factors that direct the curvature change. Epsin-1 is a representative protein thought to initiate invagination of the plasma membrane upon clathrin-coated vesicles formation. Its N-terminal helical segment (EpN18) plays a key role in inducing positive membrane curvature. This study aimed to elucidate the essential structural features of EpN18 in order to better understand general curvature-inducing mechanisms, and to design effective tools for rationally controlling membrane curvature. Structural dissection of peptides derived from EpN18 revealed the decisive contribution of hydrophobic residues to (i) enhancing membrane interactions, (ii) helix structuring, (iii) inducing positive membrane curvature, and (iv) loosening lipid packing. The strongest effect was obtained by substitution with leucine residues, as this EpN18 analog showed a marked ability to promote the influx of octa-arginine cell-penetrating peptides into living cells.

The proposed protocol, called Noent, is based on cryptographic puzzles to avoid the indiscriminate disclose of the confidential information stored on tags and on an innovative role reversal distance-bounding protocol to distinguish between honest and rogue readers. The protocol provides moderate privacy protection (data and location) to single tags but its effectiveness increases hugely when it is used to protect a large population of tags (e.g., protection against inventory disclosure). Moreover, in comparison with classical approaches, Noent does not require an on-line database, which facilitates key updating and mitigates desynchronization attacks.

J	Yan, CX; Tang, XM; Yang, H; Wang, J				Yan, Chengxi; Tang, Xuemei; Yang, Hao; Wang, Jun			A deep active learning-based and crowdsourcing-assisted solution for named entity recognition in Chinese historical corpora	ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Named entity recognition; Deep active learning; Data augmentation; Automatic label consolidation; Crowdsourcing annotation; Chinese history		PurposeThe majority of existing studies about named entity recognition (NER) concentrate on the prediction enhancement of deep neural network (DNN)-based models themselves, but the issues about the scarcity of training corpus and the difficulty of annotation quality control are not fully solved, especially for Chinese ancient corpora. Therefore, designing a new integrated solution for Chinese historical NER, including automatic entity extraction and man-machine cooperative annotation, is quite valuable for improving the effectiveness of Chinese historical NER and fostering the development of low-resource information extraction.Design/methodology/approachThe research provides a systematic approach for Chinese historical NER with a three-stage framework. In addition to the stage of basic preprocessing, the authors create, retrain and yield a high-performance NER model only using limited labeled resources during the stage of augmented deep active learning (ADAL), which entails three steps-DNN-based NER modeling, hybrid pool-based sampling (HPS) based on the active learning (AL), and NER-oriented data augmentation (DA). ADAL is thought to have the capacity to maintain the performance of DNN as high as possible under the few-shot constraint. Then, to realize machine-aided quality control in crowdsourcing settings, the authors design a stage of globally-optimized automatic label consolidation (GALC). The core of GALC is a newly-designed label consolidation model called simulated annealing-based automatic label aggregation ("SA-ALC"), which incorporates the factors of worker reliability and global label estimation. The model can assure the annotation quality of those data from a crowdsourcing annotation system.FindingsExtensive experiments on two types of Chinese classical historical datasets show that the authors' solution can effectively reduce the corpus dependency of a DNN-based NER model and alleviate the problem of label quality. Moreover, the results also show the superior performance of the authors' pipeline approaches (i.e. HPS + DA and SA-ALC) compared to equivalent baselines in each stage.Originality/valueThe study sheds new light on the automatic extraction of Chinese historical entities in an all-technological-process integration. The solution is helpful to effectively reducing the annotation cost and controlling the labeling quality for the NER task. It can be further applied to similar tasks of information extraction and other low-resource fields in theoretical and practical ways.

Usability testing of ANSWER: a web-based methotrexate decision aid for patients with rheumatoid arthritis	BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Patient decision aid; Rheumatoid arthritis; Methotrexate; Usability test	ENTERTAINMENT EDUCATION; PRIME-TIME; CARE; ADOLESCENTS; INFORMATION; LITERATE; THERAPY; RADAI; GAME	Background: Decision aids are evidence-based tools designed to inform people of the potential benefit and harm of treatment options, clarify their preferences and provide a shared decision-making structure for discussion at a clinic visit. For patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are considering methotrexate, we have developed a web-based patient decision aid called the ANSWER (Animated, Self-serve, Web-based Research Tool). This study aimed to: 1) assess the usability of the ANSWER prototype; 2) identify strengths and limitations of the ANSWER from the patient's perspective. Methods: The ANSWER prototype consisted of: 1) six animated patient stories and narrated information on the evidence of methotrexate for RA; 2) interactive questionnaires to clarify patients' treatment preferences. Eligible participants for the usability test were patients with RA who had been prescribed methotrexate. They were asked to verbalize their thoughts (i.e., think aloud) while using the ANSWER, and to complete the System Usability Scale (SUS) to assess overall usability (range = 0-100; higher = more user friendly). Participants were audiotaped and observed, and field notes were taken. The testing continued until no new modifiable issues were found. We used descriptive statistics to summarize participant characteristics and the SUS scores. Content analysis was used to identified usability issues and navigation problems. Results: 15 patients participated in the usability testing. The majority were aged 50 or over and were university/college graduates (n = 8, 53.4%). On average they took 56 minutes (SD = 34.8) to complete the tool. The mean SUS score was 81.2 (SD = 13.5). Content analysis of audiotapes and field notes revealed four categories of modifiable usability issues: 1) information delivery (i.e., clarity of the information and presentation style); 2) navigation control (i.e., difficulties in recognizing and using the navigation control buttons); 3) layout (i.e., position of the videos, text, diagrams and navigation buttons); 4) aesthetic (i.e., the colour, look and feel of the online tool). Conclusions: Although the SUS score indicated high usability before and after major modification, findings from the think-aloud sessions illustrated areas that required further refinement. Our results highlight the importance of formative evaluation in usability testing.

Fluorescent probes are the promising tools for the detection and understanding of the physiological roles of H2O2, considering that they are able to provide spatial and temporal information about target biomolecules in living cells. Nevertheless, the existent fluorescent probes have low selectivity and sensitivity on discerning H2O2. This review would like to demonstrate a comprehensive examination on the design, recognition, and performance of state-of-the-art boronate-based fluorogenic switch for the detection of H2O2, a field in which remarkable improvements have been accomplished over the last decade.

The Effect of Epistemic Cognition Interventions on Academic Achievement: A Meta-Analysis	JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						epistemic cognition; academic achievement; interventions; meta-analysis; implementation	PERSONAL EPISTEMOLOGY; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE; BELIEFS; SCIENCE; MATHEMATICS; ARGUMENTATION; COMPREHENSION; INSTRUCTION; INFORMATION; PERSPECTIVES	Epistemic cognition involves the thinking executed as people discern what they know versus what they question, doubt, or disbelieve. Effective or adaptive epistemic cognition underlies the higher-order thinking required for life in the 21st century and has been positively correlated with academic achievement. As such, researchers have designed a number of educational interventions with the goal of developing students' epistemic cognition, but no comprehensive examination of their efficacy exists. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to better understand the effect of epistemic cognition interventions upon academic achievement and what characteristics differentiated their efficacy. Twenty-six experimental and quasi-experimental studies met our inclusion criteria. Using 28 independent samples and 59 effect sizes, we found epistemic cognition interventions had a statistically significant, medium-level effect on academic achievement (Cohen's d = 0.509, p < .001). Moderator analyses revealed interventions based in guided forms of instruction and models emphasizing justification and reconciliation of objectivity and subjectivity were more successful than other interventions, suggesting several promising directions for future research and practice. Surprisingly, we found that shorter interventions were generally more successful in promoting academic performance than longer ones.

Continuous efforts have been made to understand their mechanism, which is the key to regulating materials structure. Modelling techniques have become a powerful tool that can provide detailed information on polymerization kinetics which is inaccessible by experiments. Many publications have reported the combination of experiments and modelling for free radical polymerization (FRP) and reversible-deactivation radical polymerizations (RDRP) of MVMs. Herein, a minireview is presented for the most important modelling techniques and their applications in FRP/RDRP of MVMs. This review hopes to illustrate that the combination of modelling and wet experiments can be a great asset to polymer researchers and inspire new thinking for the future MVMs experiment optimization and product design.

To solve this problem, many multi-scale feature fusion networks have been proposed to improve multi-scale target detection accuracy by fusing fine-grained information from shallow networks and semantic information from deep networks. This approach requires the introduction of extraa parameters. Thinking from another perspective, can the accuracy of multi-scale target detection be improved by fusing the feature information under different receptive fields? For this purpose, we designed a three-layer network structure called Trident-LK Net. our model uses convolutional kernels of different sizes (31, 25, 1) in the feature extraction phase and establishes cross-fusion connections. This omits the feature fusion part and greatly reduces the network parameters while obtaining a good detection accuracy. Finally we perform experiments on the neu-det dataset and the gc10 dataset to verify the feasibility of our idea. While keeping the number of parameters to a minimum, our model achieves competitive detection results on the neu-det dataset (76.9% mAP) and optimal on the gc10 dataset (63.55% mAP). Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/syyang2022/Trident-LK-Net.

Methods: Twenty-two included studies were examined for quantitative study design, outcome measure, inclusion/exclusion criteria, follow-up and recruitment strategy. Patient population and psychological assessment tools were examined for validity. Results: Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria for this study. Only 7 of the 22 studies were longitudinal and the rest were cross sectional studies. Depression was the most common psychological status of interest and was included in 17 studies. Pain catastrophizing was the psychological status of interest in 5 of the studies. Four studies considered anxiety, 3 considered pain anxiety, 3 considered distress, 2 considered coping, 2 considered catastrophic thinking, and 2 considered fear avoidance beliefs. Discussion: The majority of studies in this review were cross-sectional studies. Cross-sectional studies may not provide conclusive information about cause-and-effect relationships. This review encourages clinicians to be mindful of the psychological implications found in rehabilitation of individuals with upper extremity disease or injury along with being cognizant of choosing appropriate measurement tools that best represent each patient's characteristics and diagnoses. Conclusions: The nature of the research addressing psychological factors affecting outcomes after hand injury focus on negative traits and have limited strength to suggest causation as most have used cross-sectional designs. Stronger longitudinal designs and consideration of positive traits are needed in future studies. (C) 2017 Hanley & Belfus, an imprint of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although it is well established that there is great potential to mobilize doctors and patients in participating MMs-related clinical decisions, few interventions adopt effective measures against specific behavioral deficiencies. This study aims at developing and validating an independent consultation and feedback system (ICFS) for optimizing clinical decisions on the use of MMs for inpatients needing joint replacement surgeries. Methods Development of the research protocol is based on a problem or deficiency list derived on a trans-theoretical framework which incorporates including mainly soft systems-thinking, information asymmetry, crisis-coping, dual delegation and planned behavior. The intervention consists of two main components targeting at patients and doctors respectively. Each of the intervention ingredients is designed to tackle the doctor and patient-side problems with MMs using in joint replacement surgeries. The intervention arm receives 18 months' ICFS intervention program on the basis of the routine medical services; while the control arm, only the routine medical services. Implementation of the intervention is supported by an online platform established and maintained by the Quality Assurance Center for Medical Care in Anhui Province, a smartphone-based application program (APP) and a web-based clinical support system. Discussion The implementation of this study is expected to significantly reduce the deficiencies and moral hazards in decision-making of MMs using through the output of economic, efficient, sustainable and easy-to-promote cooperative intervention programs, thus greatly reducing medical costs and standardizing medical behaviors.

Examining students' strategies and criteria for evaluating videos versus webpages on climate change	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING			English	Article						evaluation; misinformation; sourcing; YouTube	LEARNERS EPISTEMIC CRITERIA; ADOLESCENTS EVALUATION; INFORMATION-SOURCES; SCIENCE; ONLINE; WEB; KNOWLEDGE; SELECTION; COGNITION; THINKING	BackgroundYouTube is widely used for learning about scientific issues in and out of school. However, much of the scientific information on YouTube is inaccurate. Prior studies have mostly focused on how students evaluate textual online information sources and have not yet systematically examined how they evaluate authentic scientific YouTube videos. ObjectivesThe purpose of this study was to examine how students evaluate authentic scientific YouTube videos in comparison to scientific webpages. MethodsEighth grade students ranked six YouTube videos on the topic of climate change, justified their rankings, and responded to metacognitive prompts designed to elicit their evaluation criteria and strategies. Students also responded to a parallel webpage evaluation measure. We analysed and compared students' evaluation strategies and criteria. We also examined which evaluation criteria predict students' judgments of YouTube video quality. Results and ConclusionsStudents predominantly relied on evaluation of video content, focusing mainly on criteria of communicative quality and explanation quality. Students tended to neglect source expertise and information validity criteria. Students evaluated videos mostly similarly to how they evaluated webpages. However, affective experiences played a greater role in video evaluation; whereas task relevance and verbal quality played a smaller role. Students' evaluation criteria predicted their judgments of video quality. ImplicationsThe findings suggest that students are unprepared for critically evaluating scientific YouTube videos and that digital information literacy instruction should address this gap. The study also identifies some unique challenges of video evaluation that educators should attend to.

Quantum-limited metrology and Bose-Einstein condensates	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article								We discuss a quantum-metrology protocol designed to estimate a physical parameter in a Bose-Einstein condensate of N atoms, and we show that the measurement uncertainty can decrease faster than 1/N. The 1/N scaling is usually thought to be the best possible in any measurement scheme. From the perspective of quantum information theory, we outline the main idea that leads to a measurement uncertainty that scales better than 1/N. We examine in detail some potential problems and challenges that arise in implementing such a measurement protocol using a Bose-Einstein condensate. We discuss how some of these issues can be dealt with by using lower-dimensional condensates trapped in nonharmonic potentials.

These applications demand the primitives be lightweight, yet flexible. However, PUFs are designed to offer repetitive and instance-specific randomness, whereas TRNGs are expected to be invariably random. A challenging but thought-provoking problem from a hardware designer's perspective would be to design a circuit that serves the purpose of both PUF and TRNG depending on the exact requirement of the application. Here, we present a dual-mode PUF-TRNG design that utilises two different hardware-intrinsic properties, i.e., oscillatory metastability of Transition Effect Ring Oscillator (TERO) cell and propagation delay of a buffer within the cell to achieve this goal. A 48.62% reduction in area is accomplished due to the integration in comparison to separate instances of standalone PUFs/ TRNG designs, built from Programmable Delay Line (PDL) based Arbiter PUFs (APUFs) and TERO-TRNG. Our final design has a hardware footprint of 618 Look-Up Tables (LUTs) and 447 Flip-Flops (FFs). Furthermore, experimental analysis of the state-of-the-art modelling attacks, reliability attacks on the proposed PUF design shows a prediction accuracy of 55.37% and 50.14% respectively for 5.2M Challenge Response Pairs (CRPs). Additionally, the TRNG passes evaluation through National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-22 and German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) Application Notes and Interpretation of the Scheme (AIS)-31 tests.

J	St Quinton, J				St Quinton, John			Semantic Category theory and Semantic Intertwine: the anathema of mathematics	KYBERNETES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th IEEE International Conference on Cybernetic Intelligent Systems (CIS)	AUG 23-24, 2012	Univ Limerick, Limerick, IRELAND	IEEE, IEEE SMC UK & Ireland Chapter, Univ Limerick, Dept Phys Energy, Univ Limerick, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Syst	Univ Limerick	Cognition; Mathematical modelling		Purpose - The recent scientific observation that human information processing involves four independent data types, has pinpointed a source of fallacious arguments within many domains of human thought. The species-unique ability to assign observable characteristics to purely conceptual entities has created beautiful poetry and literature. However, this ability to generate "Semantic Intertwine" has also created the most incomprehensible paradoxes and conundrums. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Semantic Intertwine can be created between, or within, Semantic Categories; and in either case it then lies at the heart of fallacious, yet often very persuasive, reasoning. Findings - This paper describes how to detect mathematically related Semantic Intertwine in erroneous arguments involving: operands (VIII), mathematical induction (VIIA), orthogonal axiom sets (VIIB), continuous functions (VIIA), exclusive disjunction (VIIA), propositional calculus (VI) and the hitherto thorny problems arising from ambiguous intra-category use of "infinity" (VIIB). Originality/value - The applications of Semantic Category Analysis (SCA) are manifold. Determine the Semantic Categories involved in an argument and their modes of combination, and any Semantic Intertwine revealed pinpoints erroneous reasoning. SCA can be applied to any domain of human thought.

Physicians' attitudes about communicating and managing scientific uncertainty differ by perceived ambiguity aversion of their patients	HEALTH EXPECTATIONS			English	Article						ambiguity aversion; patient-provider communication; shared decision making	SHARED DECISION-MAKING; HEALTH-PROFESSIONALS PERCEPTIONS; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; CARE; POWER; RECOMMENDATIONS; FACILITATORS; PREFERENCES; GUIDELINES; TOLERANCE	Background Medical interventions are often characterized by substantial scientific uncertainty regarding their benefits and harms. Physicians must communicate to their patients as part of the process of shared decision making, yet they may not always communicate scientific uncertainty for several reasons. One suggested by past research is individual differences in physicians' tolerance of uncertainty. Relatedly, an unexplored explanation is physicians' beliefs about their patients' tolerance of uncertainty. Design To test this possibility, we surveyed a sample of primary care physicians (N=1500) and examined the association between their attitudes about communicating and managing scientific uncertainty and their perceptions of negative reactions to uncertainty by their patients. Physician perceptions were measured by their propensity towards pessimistic appraisals of risk information and avoidance of decision making when risk information is ambiguous - of uncertain reliability, credibility or adequacy, known as ambiguity aversion'. Results Confirming past studies, physician demographics (e.g. medical specialty) predicted attitudes toward communicating scientific uncertainty. Additionally, physicians' beliefs about their patients' ambiguity aversion significantly predicted these preferences. Physicians who thought that more of their patients would have negative reactions to ambiguous information were more likely to think that they should decide what is best for their patients (=0.065, P=0.013), and to withhold an intervention that had uncertainty associated with it (=0.170, P<0.001). Discussion When faced with the task of communicating scientific uncertainty about medical tests and treatments, physicians' perce-ptions of their patients' ambiguity aversion may be related to their attitudes towards communicating uncertainty.

J	Trobec, I; Starcic, AI				Trobec, Irena; Starcic, Andreja Istenic			Developing nursing ethical competences online versus in the traditional classroom	NURSING ETHICS			English	Article						Active learning methods; ethical competences; experiment; healthcare; multiple-case study; online learning	SENSITIVITY; KNOWLEDGE	Background: The development of society and science, especially medical science, gives rise to new moral and ethical challenges in healthcare. Research question/objectives/hypothesis: In order to respond to the contemporary challenges that require autonomous decision-making in different work contexts, a pedagogical experiment was conducted to identify the readiness and responsiveness of current organisation of nursing higher education in Slovenia. It compared the successfulness of active learning methods online (experimental group) and in the traditional classroom (control group) and their impact on the ethical competences of nursing students. The hypothesis set in the experiment, hypothesis 1 (the experimental group will be successful and will have good achievements in comprehension and application of ethical principles) was confirmed based on pre-tests and post-tests. The hypothesis tested by the questionnaire, hypothesis 2 (according to the students, the active learning methods online in the experimental group have a positive impact on the development of ethical competences) was confirmed. Research design: The pedagogical experiment was supported by a multiple-case study that enabled the in-depth analysis of the students' attitudes towards the active learning methods in both settings. Participants and research context: The study included Slovenian first-year nursing students (N = 211) of all the enrolled students (N = 225) at the University of Ljubljana and University of Primorska in the academic year 2010/2011. Ethical considerations: Before the study ethical permission was obtained from the managements of both participating faculties. The students were given all the necessary information of the experiment before the tutorials. Findings: No significant difference was found between the two learning settings and both had a positive impact upon learning. The results of the content analysis show that the students' active engagement with the active learning methods in the group enables the development of ethical competences and the related communicative competences, interpersonal skills, collaboration and critical thinking. Discussion: Active learning methods in the settings compared, online and the traditional classroom, enabled the development of a higher level of knowledge defined by the ability of critical thinking and reflective response, the core of ethical competences. Students develop ethical competence through active engagement in a group work, role play and discussion, and there is no difference between online or traditional learning settings. Conclusion: In the healthcare, it is crucial for providers to be capable of making autonomous decisions and managing various communication situations and contexts in which the moral attitudes and ethical sensibility are essential.

It went live in May 1996 with two workstations installed in the medical record office (MRO). Doctors have no direct access to it. They dictate medical notes on tape using either structured or free dictation format, and the tape is brought to the MRO for processing. The principal aim of this study is to study the impact of the computer system on patient care. Retrospective review of medical records and in-depth interviews were conducted to study the quality of medical records and doctor's opinions. A total of 400 manual and 398 computerized patient records were randomly selected for review. The completeness of the manual notes and computerized notes using free dictation format were about the same. The computerized records using structured dictation format may be more complete than those using free dictation format. The in-depth interview shows that most doctors preferred structured medical records but some disagreed with too detailed a level of structuring. They were not familiar with POMR, and some even thought that breaking down the record by problem was not possible. AU felt that the present system would not directly affect patient care, but some said that it would facilitate research. In conclusion, since the utility of the information mainly depends on the doctors' efforts, commitment to the agreed structure and subsequent routine audit of computerized medical records are essential to make sure that diagnoses are accurately coded and information is correctly structured.

The Utility of an Online Forward Triage Tool During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: Health Care Provider and Health Authority Perspectives	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						OFTT utility; health care providers; health authorities; perspectives; COVID-19; pandemic; telehealth in future; perceived barriers and drivers		IntroductionThe SARS CoV-2 pandemic poses major challenges not only to patients but also to health care professionals and policy-makers, with rapidly changing, sometimes complex, recommendations, and guidelines to the population. Online forward triage tools (OFTT) got a major boost from the pandemic as they helped with the implementation and monitoring of recommendations. MethodsA multiphase mixed method sequential explanatory study design was employed. Quantitative data were collected first and informed the qualitative interview guides. Video interviews were held with key informants (health care providers and health authorities) between 2 September and 10 December 2020. Audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim, coded thematically and compared with patient perspectives (framework). ObjectivesTo explore the perspectives of health care providers and authorities in Canton Bern on the utility of a COVID-19 OFTT, as well as elicit recommendations for telehealth in future. ResultsThe following themes emerged; (i) accessibility (ii) health system burden reduction (iii) utility in preventing onward transmission (iv) utility in allaying fear and anxiety (v) medical decision-making utility (vi) utility as information source (vii) utility in planning and systems thinking. The health care providers and health authorities further provided insights on potential barriers and facilitators of telehealth in future. ConclusionSimilar to patients, health care providers acknowledge the potential and utility of the COVID-19 OFTT particularly as an information source and in reducing the health system burden. Data privacy, doctor-patient relationship, resistance to change, regulatory, and mandate issues, and lack of systems thinking were revealed as barriers to COVID-19 OFTT utility.

In phase 1, patients who underwent THA between 2013-2017 at our center were sent an anonymous online survey to evaluate their experience in returning to sexual activity. In phase 2, patients scheduled for a unilateral or bilateral THA were given a questionnaire that evaluated the educational tool developed from Phase 1. Descriptive statistics and chi-squared tests were used to analyze the data. In phase 1, the overall response rate was 38% (n = 64/167). Patients sexually active prior to THA were 5.3 times more likely to want information on this topic. Patients selected the informational pamphlet as the best method of delivering information (p = .04). In phase 2, the response rate was 55% (n = 30/55). Overall, 90% of patients thought the pamphlet addressed all their concerns, and 93% felt they were provided information on how to obtain more information on this subject. Patients sexually active prior to THA are more interested in receiving information on return to sexual activity. Educational pamphlets may be useful in clinical practice for providing information.

In fact, the treated tumors often contain a higher frequency of chemo-resistant CSCs. It is thought that CSC formation is supported by exposure of cancer cells to sub-cytotoxic chemotherapy doses as a result of poor drug penetration in epithelial tumors. We have shown that low-dos cisplatin triggers the transdifferentiation of ovarian cancer cells into CSCs through processes that are also involved in the generation and maintenance of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Considering similarities between CSCs and iPS cells, we screened a library of 60 synthetic small-molecule compounds, designed to influence EMT/MET signaling in iPS cells on primary ovarian cancer cells. Using a Nanog reporter system we identified a series of compounds capable of blocking the cisplatin triggered formation of CSCs. We then focused on compound GHDM-1515, a drug that acts on pathways that regulate histone demethylases. We demonstrated that co-treatment of primary ovarian cancer cells with GHDM-1515 significantly increased cisplatin induced apoptosis, specifically apoptosis of CSCs. GHDM-1515 inhibited EMT and the cisplatin-induced formation of CSCs. This suggests that GHDM-1515 can sensitize ovarian cancer cells to low-dose cisplatin and potentially enhance the efficacy of cisplatin chemotherapy.

This paper gives an overview of heuristic rules that can support practitioners to develop a business process design that is a radical improvement of a current design. The emphasis is on the mechanics of the process, rather than on behavioral or change management aspects. The various best practices are derived from a wide literature survey and supplemented with experiences of the authors. To evaluate the impact of each best practice along the dimensions of cost, flexibility, time and quality, a conceptual framework is presented that synthesizes views from areas such as information systems development, enterprise modeling and workflow management. The best practices are thought to have a wide applicability across various industries and business processes. They can be used as a "check list" for process redesign under the umbrella of diverse management approaches such as Total Cycle Time compression, the Lean Enterprise and Constraints Management.

J	Wei, H; Dai, DW; Bu, YJ				Wei, Hui; Dai, Dawei; Bu, Yijie			A plausible neural circuit for decision making and its formation based on reinforcement learning	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Neural circuit; Behaviors; Decision-making; Network flow; Reinforcement learning	SPIKING NEURONS; BRAIN-FUNCTION; C-ELEGANS; MODEL; CORTEX; PERFORMANCE; CHEMOTAXIS; DOPAMINE; NETWORKS; BEHAVIOR	A human's, or lower insects', behavior is dominated by its nervous system. Each stable behavior has its own inner steps and control rules, and is regulated by a neural circuit. Understanding how the brain influences perception, thought, and behavior is a central mandate of neuroscience. The phototactic flight of insects is a widely observed deterministic behavior. Since its movement is not stochastic, the behavior should be dominated by a neural circuit. Based on the basic firing characteristics of biological neurons and the neural circuit's constitution, we designed a plausible neural circuit for this phototactic behavior from logic perspective. The circuit's output layer, which generates a stable spike firing rate to encode flight commands, controls the insect's angular velocity when flying. The firing pattern and connection type of excitatory and inhibitory neurons are considered in this computational model. We simulated the circuit's information processing using a distributed PC array, and used the real-time average firing rate of output neuron clusters to drive a flying behavior simulation. In this paper, we also explored how a correct neural decision circuit is generated from network flow view through a bee's behavior experiment based on the reward and punishment feedback mechanism. The significance of this study: firstly, we designed a neural circuit to achieve the behavioral logic rules by strictly following the electrophysiological characteristics of biological neurons and anatomical facts. Secondly, our circuit's generality permits the design and implementation of behavioral logic rules based on the most general information processing and activity mode of biological neurons. Thirdly, through computer simulation, we achieved new understanding about the cooperative condition upon which multi-neurons achieve some behavioral control. Fourthly, this study aims in understanding the information encoding mechanism and how neural circuits achieve behavior control. Finally, this study also helps establish a transitional bridge between the microscopic activity of the nervous system and macroscopic animal behavior.

Therefore, to improve the UI, developers should pay attention to what users think and actively respond to their feedback. User reviews from different channels provide a way for developers to obtain users' suggestions about the UI, and it could be of great benefit to improve the UI of their apps. Methods to mine different information (e.g., bug report, feature request) from reviews have been proposed in the previous works, however, suggestion information for supporting UI improvement has not gained much attention. In this paper, we propose UISMiner (UI Suggestion Miner), a novel approach to automatically mine the suggestions about the UI design from reviews. The application of UISMiner relies on natural language processing and machine learning classifier, which involves three main steps: 1) gaining reviews related to UI suggestion by training a classifier; 2) extracting UI suggestions from the obtained reviews by defining rules. 3) associating UI suggestions with the corresponding part in the UI. The experiment based on Google Play shows that UISMiner can effectively obtain reviews related to UI suggestions and extract such information from the gained reviews, the F-measure can reach 87.71% and 76.99% respectively. Furthermore, the survey on 10 developers shows that the information provided by us is useful for updating the UI of apps.

Traditional techniques for instrumenting enterprise DRE systems require DRE system developers to make design decisions regarding what metrics to collect during early phases of the software lifecycle so these needs can be factored into the system architecture. In many circumstances, however, it is hard for DRE system developers to know this information during early phases of the software lifecycle-especially when metrics come from many heterogeneous sources (such as application-and system-level hardware and software resources) and evaluating performance is traditionally an after-thought. To address these issues, this article presents the design and performance of OASIS, which is SOA-based middleware and tools that dynamically instruments enterprise DRE system without requiring design-time knowledge of which metrics to collect. This article also empirically evaluates OASIS in the context of a representative enterprise DRE system case study from the domain of shipboard computing. Results from applying OASIS to this case study show that its flexibility enables DRE system testers to precisely control instrumentation overhead. We also highlight open challenges in dynamic instrumentation for next-generation enterprise DRE systems.

Here we use a nanomechanical mapping to assess the structural evolution and mechanical properties of a deformed isoprene rubber (IR) to elucidate a self-reinforcement mechanism in this material. A hierarchical nanofibrillar structure, ranging from several to a hundred nanometers in size, comprised of fibers oriented parallel to the stretching direction was found. The nanofibers, connected by oriented amorphous tie chains, form a network structure that is responsible for significantly enhanced stress, a key factor giving rise to the self-reinforcement of IR and, more than likely, most elastomers that undergo strained-induced crystallization.

In this study, we focused on the effects of bodily states and depression and anxiety traits. Participants performed a past/future thinking task in which three-part sentences including temporal cues were presented in a sequential pattern, for example "in the near future/dreams/will come true". We measured heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs) to assess affective processing, and event-related potentials (ERPs) to assess temporal processing of thoughts that emerged when the temporal cue words were presented. The HEPs predicted thought valence irrespective of personality traits. Larger N400 ERPs were observed in response to past-oriented than to future oriented words in participants with higher levels of depression, whereas the opposite was the case in participants with higher social anxiety. Our data suggest that afferent signals modulate affective thought-orientations as triggers, and that individuals with depression and anxiety have sensitivity toward temporal information at the neural level.

A Nursery and Greenhouse Online Knowledge Center: Learning Opportunities for Sustainable Practice	HORTTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						irrigation; fertilization; surface water management; pathogens; Moodle; distance-learning modules	RUNOFF; NUTRIENT; IRRIGATION; GROWTH; WATER	Increasing environmental concerns and legislation in many states and in other countries require that we take a more comprehensive sustainable "best management" approach to production techniques in nursery and greenhouse operations. This is particularly important because these production facilities are typically intense users of resources that are applied to relatively small land areas. We have developed an online knowledge center to facilitate the implementation of more sustainable practices within the nursery and greenhouse industry. A web-based knowledge center provides the most cost-effective mechanism for information delivery, as our potential audiences are extremely diverse and widespread. We currently have a registered user database of over 450 educators, growers, and industry professionals, and undergraduate and graduate students. A gateway website provides an overview of the issues and the goals of the project. The associated knowledge center currently has 25 in-depth learning modules, designed in a Moodle learning management framework. These learning modules are designed to actively engage learners in topics on substrate, irrigation, surface water, and nutrient and crop health management, which are integral to formulating farm-specific strategies for more sustainable water and nutrient management practices. Additional modules provide assessment and implementation tools for irrigation audits, irrigation methods and technologies, and water and nutrient management planning. The instructional design of the learning modules was paramount because there can be multiple strategies to improve site-specific production practices, which often require an integration of knowledge from engineering, plant science, and plant pathology disciplines. The assessment and review of current practices, and the decision to change a practice, are often not linear, nor simple. All modules were designed with this process in mind, and include numerous resources [pictures, diagrams, case studies, and assessment tools (e.g., spreadsheets and example calculations)] to enable the learner to fully understand all of the options available and to think critically about his/her decisions. Sixteen of the modules were used to teach an intensive 400-level "Principles of Water and Nutrient Management" course at the University of Maryland during Spring 2008 and 2009. The water and nutrient management planning module also supports the nursery and greenhouse Farmer Training Certification program in Maryland. The Maryland Department of Agriculture provides continuing education credits for all consultants and growers who register and complete any module in the knowledge center. Although these learning resources were developed by faculty in the eastern region of the United States, much of the information is applicable to more widespread audiences.

Engaging future healthcare professionals for rural health services in South Africa: students, graduates and managers perceptions	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Healthcare professionals; Non-profit organization; Improving healthcare systems; Rural health; Recruitment and retention system; KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa	QUALITATIVE RESEARCH	BackgroundThe shortage of healthcare professionals (HCP) negatively affects health services in rural areas in many parts of the world, as is the case in South Africa. Innovative programs designed to improve the recruitment strategies for health system in a rural area are essential. They need support with a scholarship and mentorship programme for young people from rural areas to study for health science degrees, with the aim that they would take up a post at the hospital in their community, once qualified.This paper reports the perceptions and experiences of the students and graduates sponsored by the foundation, and those of managers from the facilities where the students were ultimately placed, in order to gauge whether such a programme can make a sustainable contribution to address the shortage of health personnel in rural areas and to what extent this is happening.MethodsThe authors used qualitative methods, combining semi-structured in-depth interviews and focus groups and the data were analyzed thematically.ResultsThe results provide information on students interviewed who appreciated the financial and socio-emotional support that they received. On the other hand, graduates value the availability of jobs in their home community on completion of their studies. The managers reported the success of the programme in increasing the number of healthcare personnel at the hospitals, and the increased range of available medical services. Since the graduates are familiar with the language and culture of their patients the managers considered that they are better able to assist them.ConclusionsThe system was well thought-out and achieved its goal of improving health services in an underdeveloped rural area of South Africa. More could be achieved if other government services in the area were simultaneously improved and if the system were replicated elsewhere. The students and graduates from rural areas are involved on sustaining health services in rural areas while rural managers support the programme and make suggestions for improvement and to promote the program in other regions.

J	Baghbanian, A; Torkfar, G				Baghbanian, Abdolvahab; Torkfar, Ghazal			Economics and resourcing of complex healthcare systems	AUSTRALIAN HEALTH REVIEW			English	Review							DECISION-MAKING; ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS; ALLOCATION; FRAMEWORK; STRATEGY; SCIENCE; ISSUES	With rapid increases in healthcare spending over recent years, health economic evaluation might be thought to be increasing in importance to decision-makers. Such evaluations are designed to inform the efficient management of healthcare resources. However, research into health policy decisions often report, at best, moderate use of economic evaluation information, especially at the local level of administration. Little attention seems to have been given to the question of why economic evaluations have been underused and why they may yield different results in different contexts. There are many barriers to applying economic evaluations in situations which combine complexity with uncertainty. These barriers call for innovative and creative responses to economic evaluation of healthcare interventions. One response is to view economic evaluations in the context of complex adaptive systems theory. Such theory offers a conceptual framework that takes into account contextual factors, multiple input and output, multiple perspectives and uncertainty involved in healthcare interventions. This article illustrates how complexity theory can enrich and broaden policy-makers' understanding of why economic evaluations have not always been as successful as health economists would have hoped. It argues for health economists to emphasise contextual knowledge and relativist understanding of decision contexts rather than seeking more technically sound evidence-based reviews including economic evaluations.

This has led to suggestions that medical education should become more community-oriented if today's medical students are to become effective medical practitioners. Recent curriculum reforms in a number of medical schools frequently involve a more student-centred approach, which encourages students to learn by intellectual discovery and critical thinking. We describe one such exercise in community diagnosis that has been developed in Glasgow's new undergraduate medical curriculum. Design The exercise has been developed as three teaching sessions, each with specific learning objectives. The first session explores the strengths and weaknesses of routine statistics, and reveals the lack of information regarding individual's and community's health and health care needs. The second session is a community-based rapid participatory appraisal arranged by general practitioners. Students interview patients, carers, and local key informants and health care professionals about their perceptions of health and health needs. In the final campus-based session, students combine and present their findings. Development included two pilot exercises involving detailed evaluation. Setting University of Glasgow. Subjects Medical students. Results Students valued the contrasting perspectives and information provided by different sources. After completing the three sessions, most students and tutors considered it an interesting, enjoyable and educational experience. Conclusions This innovative community-oriented teaching programme gave students some insight into how health, morbidity and mortality are measured, why these might vary between different communities, and how different community members' perspectives might differ regarding perceived health and social needs.

It is thought to inactivate the viral genome by producing virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs). Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) is transmitted to plants by the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus), and seriously threatens production of rice in East Asia, particularly Oryza sativa japonica subspecies. Through deep sequencing, genome-wide comparisons of RBSDV-derived vsiRNAs were made between the japonica variety Nipponbare, and the indica variety 9311. Four small RNA libraries were constructed from the leaves and shoots of each variety. We found 659,756 unique vsiRNAs in the four samples, and only 43,485 reads were commonly shared. The size distributions of vsiRNAs were mostly 21- and 22-nt long, and A/U bias (66-68%) existed at the first nucleotide of vsiRNAs. Additionally, vsiRNAs were continuously but heterogeneously distributed along S1-S10 segments of the RBSDV genome. Distribution profiles of vsiRNA hotspots were similar in different hosts and tissues, and the 5- and 3-terminal regions of S4, S5, and S8 had more hotspots. Distribution and abundance of RBSDV vsiRNAs could be useful in designing efficient targets for exploiting RNA interference for virus resistance. Degradome analysis found 25 and 11 host genes appeared to be targeted by vsiRNAs in 9311 and Nipponbare. We report for the first time vsiRNAs derived from RBSDV-infected rice.

J	Lu, CH; Shen, YM				Lu, CH; Shen, YM			Harnessing the potential of chemical defenses from antimicrobial activities	BIOESSAYS			English	Article							SOLID-STATE FERMENTATION; DRUG DISCOVERY; COMBINATORIAL BIOSYNTHESIS; STREPTOMYCES-COELICOLOR; SECONDARY METABOLITES; ANTIFUNGAL COMPOUNDS; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; GENOME SEQUENCE; DUAL CULTURE; RESISTANCE	Resistance to the drugs used in the treatment of many infectious diseases is increasing, while microbial infections are being found to be responsible for more life-threatening diseases than previously thought. Despite a large investment in the invention and application of high-throughput screening techniques involving miniaturization and automation, and a diverse array of strategies for designing and constructing various chemical libraries, relatively few new drugs have resulted. Natural products, however, have been a majorsource of drugs for centuries. Since some of them are produced by organisms as a result of selection in favour of improved defense against competing deleterious microorganisms, in principle they would be less likely to incur resistance. Furthermore, the production of those defensive secondary metabolites is inducible because their original function is a response to environmental challenges. Moreover, symbioses, cohabitation associations between two or more different species of organisms, are universal in nature, and the production of secondary metabolites by symbiotic microbes may be an important adaptation allowing microbes to affect their hosts. Therefore, co-culture strategies, using combinations of plant cell-pathogenic microbes, plant cell-endophytes (or symbionts), and symbiont-pathogenic microbes, based on the principles of chemical defense and the known mechanisms of organism interactions, may be an efficient general approach in the search for new anti-microbial drugs.

We conducted separate surveys for two groups of Iranian drivers, namely passenger car drivers and truck drivers. In order to assess driving risk perception, respondents were asked what they think about their Probability of Having a Road Accident (PHRA) and if they eventually have an accident as a driver, what they think about the Probability of it being Fatal or causing Severe Injury (PFSI). A Bivariate Ordered Probit model, which considers the possible correlation between PHRA and PFSI, was developed to explain the observed driving risk perception using type of vehicle, driving experience, socio-demographic information, and driving behaviour. According to the results, vehicle type, vehicle age, driving experience, sleep quality, at-fault accidents over the past three years, vehicles safety-related equipment, and education level have significant effects on driving risk perception (p-value < 0.05). In addition, this paper compares the driving risk perception of truck and passenger car drivers. The results show that truck drivers have a higher perception of PHRA and PFSI compared with passenger car drivers (p-value < 0.05). The results may convince policy-makers to consider the characteristics of the two categories of drivers when designing regulations.

In order to guarantee the vehicle user satisfaction of multimedia service, with the proliferation of the distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) cooperative transmission technologies, P2P-based VANET has recently received a substantial amount of interest. Using the P2P services thought and at the same time, a set of methods should be designed to avoid the disadvantage of P2P system appearing in VANET. Under such a presupposition, in this paper, we study the media provisions in P2P-based VANET and present a repeated game "More Pay for More Work (RGMPMW)" incentive mechanism based on service evaluation information. We also propose evolutionary game-based veracity (EGV) gamemodel which exploits evolutionary game to guarantee the multimedia service share veracity of all vehicles in VANET. In addition, we provide extensive simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.

Design: The design is qualitative. Methods: A convenient sample of staff in three nursing homes was used and data were collected during three focus group interviews. The total number of informants was 14. Thematic content analysis was used. The data collection period was from December 2015-February 2016. Results: According to the staff, several factors contribute to the prevention of physical abuse of residents in nursing homes. There is a requirement for increased competence among staff about the concept of abuse and known risk factors. Good communication skills and trusting relationships are important factors, as well as a culture that fosters openness where ethical dilemmas can be discussed.

Future Socio-Political Scenarios for Aquatic Resources in Europe: A Common Framework Based on Shared-Socioeconomic-Pathways (SSPs)	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						scenario; marine; aquaculture; fisheries; climate change	CLIMATE-CHANGE RESEARCH; NORTHEAST ATLANTIC; FISHERIES; FISH	It has proven extremely challenging for researchers to predict with confidence how human societies might develop in the future, yet managers and industries need to make projections in order to test adaptation and mitigation strategies designed to build resilience to long-term shocks. This paper introduces exploratory scenarios with a particular focus on European aquaculture and fisheries and describes how these scenarios were designed. Short-, mediumand long-term developments in socio-political drivers may be just as important in determining profits, revenues and prospects in the aquaculture and fisheries industries as physical drivers such as longterm climate change. Four socio-political-economic futures were developed, based partly on the IPCC SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) framework and partly on the newer system of Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). 'Off the shelf' narrative material as well as quantitative outputs were 'borrowed' from earlier frameworks but supplemented with material generated through in-depth stakeholder workshops involving industry and policy makers. Workshop participants were tasked to outline how they thought their sector might look under the four future worlds and, in particular, to make use of the PESTEL conceptual framework (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal) as an aide memoire to help define the scope of each scenario. This work was carried out under the auspices of the EU Horizon 2020 project CERES (Climate change and European aquatic RESources), and for each 'CERES scenario' (World Markets, National Enterprise, Global Sustainability and Local Stewardship), additional quantitative outputs were generated, including projections of future fuel and fish prices, using the MAGNET (Modular Applied GeNeral Equilibrium Tool) modeling framework. In developing and applying the CERES scenarios, we have demonstrated that the basic architecture is sufficiently flexible to be used at a wide diversity of scales. We urge the climate science community to adopt a similar scenarios framework, based around SSPs, to facilitate global cross-comparison of fisheries and aquaculture model outputs more broadly and to harmonize communication regarding potential future bioeconomic impacts of climate change.

In mammalian cells, eIF-2B is a complex of five different subunits termed epsilon, delta,gamma, beta and alpha. To clone cDNAs for the beta subunit of rabbit eIF-2B, amino acid sequence data was first obtained and used to design redundant oligonucleotide primers for use in PCR. PCR products were used to screen a rabbit liver cDNA library in lambda gt11 to obtain full-length cDNAs for eIF-2B beta. The cDNAs were sequenced completely on both strands and revealed an open reading frame encoding a predicted 351-amino acid polypeptide of 39.0 kDa. The molecular mass and pI (5.99) of the predicted protein agree well with the properties of eIF-2B beta purified from rabbit reticulocytes. In vitro transcription/translation of the cDNAs gave rise to a product that migrated at a position indistinguishable from that of this subunit of the purified protein. The amino acid sequence shows a high degree of similarity to that of GCD7, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein thought to be equivalent to mammalian eIF-2B beta. Northern-blot analysis revealed a single major mRNA species for eIF-2B beta in each of the four rabbit tissues tested.

Chemistry outreach as a community of practice: investigating the relationship between student-facilitators' experiences and boundary processes in a student-run organization	CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article							ORGANIC-CHEMISTRY; GENDER-GAP; SCIENCE; STEM; PROGRAM; TECHNOLOGY; EFFICACY; IDENTITY; POLYMER; CAMP	Previous work on chemistry outreach has mainly focused on designing and implementing demonstrations for outreach. Recent studies indicate student organizations are at the forefront of chemistry outreach and described their outreach practices and conceptual understanding of demonstrations. However, more research is needed regarding the experiences of facilitators leading outreach events to understand their motivation, what they are gaining from participating, how they are contributing to the community,etc.By providing this information, we can give more structure to outreach initiatives as an informal learning environment. This work is part of a larger study that explores the relationship between leadership in student organizations and chemistry outreach events. Here, we present how diversity plays a role in chemistry outreach, as informed by interviews involving nine graduate students who actively participated in outreach. Communities of practice (CoP) has been used as a framework to describe learning environments and student organizations participating in outreach can be thought of as a CoP. The findings suggest diversity and inclusion influence boundary processes of the student organization as a CoP. Specifically, students' prior experiences related to gender, race/ethnicity, education and other outreach events play a role in their purpose for doing chemistry outreach, how they contribute to planning of events and how they interact with the audience of outreach events.

Foldamer-Mediated Structural Rearrangement Attenuates Aβ Oligomerization and Cytotoxicity	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ISLET AMYLOID POLYPEPTIDE; ALPHA-HELIX MIMETICS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; AGGREGATION INHIBITOR; RATIONAL DESIGN; PEPTIDE; TOXICITY; FIBRILS; PATHWAY; PROTEIN	The conversion of the native random coil amyloid beta (A beta) into amyloid fibers is thought to be a key event in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A significant body of evidence suggests that the highly dynamic A beta oligomers are the main causal agent associated with the onset of AD. Among many potential therapeutic approaches, one is the Modulation of A beta conformation into off-pathway structures to avoid the formation of the putative neurotoxic A beta oligomers. A library of oligoquinolines was screened to identify antagonists of A beta oligomerization, amyloid formation, and cytotoxicity. A dianionic tetraquinoline, denoted as 5, was one of the most potent antagonists of A beta fibrillation. Biophysical assays including amyloid kinetics, dot blot, ELISA, and TEM show that 5 effectively inhibits both A beta oligomerization and fibrillation. The antagonist activity of 5 toward A beta aggregation diminishes with sequence and positional changes in the surface functionalities. 5 binds to the central discordant alpha-helical region and induces a unique a-helical conformation in A beta. Interestingly, 5 adjusts its conformation to optimize the antagonist activity against A beta. 5 effectively rescues neuroblastoma cells from A beta-mediated cytotoxicity and antagonizes fibrillation and cytotoxicity pathways of secondary nucleation induced by seeding. 5 is also equally effective in inhibiting preformed oligomer-mediated processes. Collectively, 5 induces strong secondary structure in A beta and inhibits its functions including oligomerization, fibrillation, and cytotoxicity.

However, the nature of ePortfolios varies greatly amongst programs, as does the software, purpose, and institutional cost. Objectives: An integrative review of the literature was conducted to determine how ePortfolios are being used in pre-registration health programs to enhance clinical learning. Data sources: A systematic search of relevant databases (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Education Resources Information Center, Cochrane, Medline, ProQuest, PubMed, Turning Research Into Practice, and Web of Science) was performed and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Retrieved papers were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool and findings were analysed. Review methods: A total of 272 records were identified. Thirty papers were assessed in detail. Five themes were identified by content analysis; feedback and communication; student-centred learning; experiences and competencies; access, attitudes, and digital literacy; and technological support. Conclusions: ePortfolios offer a range of pedagogical benefits. Clinical learning is enhanced by student-focused ePortfolio design which includes clear learning outcomes; development of relationships with peers and instructors via ongoing communication and feedback; use of templates; links to time-saving applications; and guided, assessed reflections. Poor technological support, negative attitudes by clinical supervisors, unreliable access, instructor-focused design, and excessive or repetitive documentation in ePortfolio design hindered clinical learning.

Development and Evaluation of a Digital Intervention for Fulfilling the Needs of Older Migrant Patients With Cancer: User-Centered Design Approach	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						cancer; patient participation; health services needs and demand; eHealth; migrants; physician-patient relations; culture; mobile phone	QUESTION PROMPT LIST; OF-LIFE; PARTICIPATION; COMMUNICATION; BARRIERS; CARE; PERCEPTIONS; LANGUAGE; CONSULTATIONS; INVOLVEMENT	Background: Older migrant patients with cancer face many language- and culture-related barriers to patient participation during medical consultations. To bridge these barriers, an eHealth tool called Health Communicator was developed in the Netherlands. Essentially used as a digital translator that can collect medical history information from patients, the Health Communicator did not include an oncological module so far, despite the fact that the prevalence of Dutch migrant patients with cancer is rising. Objective: This study aims to systematically develop, implement, and conduct a pilot evaluation of an oncological module that can be integrated into the Health Communicator to stimulate patient participation among older Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch patients with cancer. Methods: The Spiral Technology Action Research model, which incorporates 5 cycles that engage key stakeholders in intervention development, was used as a framework. The listen phase consisted of a needs assessment. The plan phase consisted of developing the content of the oncological module, namely the question prompt lists (QPLs) and scripts for patient education videos. On the basis of pretests in the do phase, 6 audiovisual QPLs on patient rights, treatment, psychosocial support, lifestyle and access to health care services, patient preferences, and clinical trials were created. Additionally, 5 patient education videos were created about patient rights, psychosocial support, clinical trials, and patient-professional communication. In the study phase, the oncological module was pilot-tested among 27 older Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch patients with cancer during their consultations. In the act phase, the oncological model was disseminated to practice. Results: The patient rights QPL was chosen most often during the pilot testing in the study phase. Patients and health care professionals perceived the QPLs as easy to understand and useful. There was a negative correlation between the tool's ease of use and patient age. Patients reported that using the module impacted the consultations positively and thought they were more active compared with previous consultations. Health care professionals also found patients to be more active than usual. Health care professionals asked significantly more questions than patients during consultations. Patients requested to see the patients' rights video most often. Patients rated the videos as easy to understand, useful, and informative. Most of the patients wanted to use the tool in the future. Conclusions: Older migrant patients with cancer, survivors, and health care professionals found the oncological module to be a useful tool and have shown intentions to incorporate it into future consultation sessions. Both QPLs and videos were evaluated positively, the latter indicating that the use of narratives to inform older, low-literate migrant patients with cancer about health-related topics in their mother tongue is a viable approach to increase the effectiveness of health care communication with this target group.

In this study, a total of 110 waxy and 110 common maize inbred lines were genotyped with 3072 SNPs to evaluate the genetic diversity, population structure, and linkage disequilibrium decay as well as identify putative loci that are under positive selection. The results revealed abundant genetic diversity in the studied panel and that genetic diversity was much higher in common than in waxy maize germplasms. Principal coordinate analysis and neighbor-joining cluster analysis consistently classified the 220 accessions into two major groups and a mixed group with mixed ancestry. Subpopulation structure in both waxy and common maize sets were associated with the germplasm origin and corresponding heterotic groups. The LD decay distance (1500-2000 kb) in waxy maize was lower than that in common maize. Fourteen candidate loci were identified as under positive selection between waxy and common maize at the 99% confidence level. The information from this study can assist waxy maize breeders by enhancing parental line selection and breeding program design.

J	Sjöblom, M; Meaney, T				Sjoblom, Marie; Meaney, Tamsin			"I am part of the group, the others listen to me": theorising productive listening in mathematical group work	EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Listening; Student interactions; Group work; Mathematical problem solving		Although group work is considered beneficial for problem solving, the listening that is needed for jointly solving mathematical problems is under-researched. In this article, the usefulness of two communication frameworks for understanding students' listening is examined, using data from an educational design research study in an upper secondary mathematics classroom in Sweden. From the analysis, it was apparent that these frameworks did not provide sufficient information about the complexity of listening in this context. Consequently, a new framework, "productive listening," is described which focuses on observable features connected to students' ability to show willingness to listen and to request listening from others. This framework included the purpose for listening, connected to problem-solving stages, and social aspects to do with respecting the speaker's contribution as being valuable and feeling that one's own contribution would be listened to. These two aspects are linked to socio-mathematical norms about expecting to listen to others' mathematical thinking and to ask clarifying questions about this thinking. By using this framework on the data from the earlier study, it was possible to better understand the complexity of listening in group work about mathematical problem solving.

Common expectations among professional and regulatory bodies in information and communication technologies (ICT) include professional knowledge, understanding of systematic impacts and needs, problem solving, teamwork, technology resources, modelling and analysis, programming, and self-management. This article focuses on intentional development of ICT competencies in post-secondary education. The authors present a continuous improvement model for integrated curriculum design, with activities and assessments specifically selected to develop professional skills in the context of the discipline. The approach involves building common under-standings, providing examples of effective teaching practices, using data for evaluation, and implementing high-impact strategies for attainment of competencies. Activities at Queen's University that have been supported by the authors are presented as a case study. Criterion-based assessment of authentic disciplinary tasks is shown to be effective in detecting incremental improvement in competencies, and learning gains on standardized tests were significant and meaningful for problem solving, critical thinking, and communication. The use of standardized assessment has limitations, but feedback to departments enabled learning needs to be addressed. These examples are highlighted as part of a continuous improvement model to develop competencies by tailoring curriculum and learning strategies, assessing student achievement, and using the data to inform high-impact strategies for attainment of competencies.

The recent past and promising future for data integration methods to estimate species' distributions	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						data fusion; integrated distribution model; joint likelihood; spatial point process; species distribution modelling	PRESENCE-ONLY DATA; FALSE-POSITIVE DETECTIONS; ESTIMATING SITE OCCUPANCY; CAPTURE-RECAPTURE DATA; POINT PROCESS MODELS; DETECTION PROBABILITIES; DEMOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS; ESTIMATING ABUNDANCE; DESIGNING OCCUPANCY; DENSITY-ESTIMATION	With the advance of methods for estimating species distribution models has come an interest in how to best combine datasets to improve estimates of species distributions. This has spurred the development of data integration methods that simultaneously harness information from multiple datasets while dealing with the specific strengths and weaknesses of each dataset. We outline the general principles that have guided data integration methods and review recent developments in the field. We then outline key areas that allow for a more general framework for integrating data and provide suggestions for improving sampling design and validation for integrated models. Key to recent advances has been using point-process thinking to combine estimators developed for different data types. Extending this framework to new data types will further improve our inferences, as well as relaxing assumptions about how parameters are jointly estimated. These along with the better use of information regarding sampling effort and spatial autocorrelation will further improve our inferences. Recent developments form a strong foundation for implementation of data integration models. Wider adoption can improve our inferences about species distributions and the dynamic processes that lead to distributional shifts.	[Miller, David A.

J	Southwood, LL; Baxter, GM; Hutchison, JM; Shuster, R				Southwood, LL; Baxter, GM; Hutchison, JM; Shuster, R			Survey of diplomates of the American College of Veterinary Surgeons regarding postoperative intraabdominal adhesion formation in horses undergoing abdominal surgery	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article							END-TO-END; SODIUM CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE; GASTROINTESTINAL-DISEASE; SMALL-INTESTINE; PREVENTION; ANASTOMOSIS; PONIES; RAT	Objective-To obtain information from specialists in equine surgery as to prevalence of, predisposing factors for, and methods to prevent postoperative adhesion formation in horses undergoing abdominal surgery. Design-Survey. Procedure-Surveys were mailed to 196 diplomates of the American College of Veterinary Surgeons involved in equine practice. Results-60 (31%) surveys were returned. Most respondents (55/60) routinely informed clients of the risk of postoperative adhesion formation in horses with small intestinal lesions. When asked after which procedures they routinely used measures to prevent adhesions, 56 of 60 (93%) indicated that they did after small intestinal resection and anastomosis and 56 of 60 (93%) indicated that they did after any abdominal surgery in foals. The 4 methods most frequently listed when respondents were asked which methods were effective at preventing adhesion formation were meticulous surgical technique, administration of antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intraoperative peritoneal lavage, and methods that prevent abdominal contamination. Most respondents (50/60) thought that at least some horses with colic secondary to adhesion formation could be managed medically. Fifty-four (90%) respondents indicated that they were successful less than half of the time when treating horses with adhesions severe enough to require additional surgery. Conclusion-In general, respondents thought that less than 15% of horses undergoing abdominal surgery would develop adhesions, but that horses with small intestinal disease and foals were most prone to develop adhesions. Meticulous surgical technique was thought to be the most important factor in preventing adhesions, and many prevention regimens reported to be effective in the literature were not commonly used in practice.

TICH-2 Investigators	Tranexamic acid to improve functional status in adults with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: the TICH-2 RCT	HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT			English	Article							INITIAL CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT; BLOOD-PRESSURE; EARLY SURGERY; ACUTE STROKE; MANAGEMENT; HEMATOMAS; GROWTH; SAFETY; TRIAL; ANTIFIBRINOLYTICS	Background: Tranexamic acid reduces death due to bleeding after trauma and postpartum haemorrhage. Objective: The aim of the study was to assess if tranexamic acid is safe, reduces haematoma expansion and improves outcomes in adults with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Design: The TICH-2 (Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary IntraCerebral Haemorrhage) study was a pragmatic, Phase III, prospective, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Acute stroke services at 124 hospitals in 12 countries (Denmark, Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK). Participants: Adult patients (aged >= 18 years) with ICH within 8 hours of onset. Exclusion criteria: Exclusion criteria were ICH secondary to anticoagulation, thrombolysis, trauma or a known underlying structural abnormality; patients for whom tranexamic acid was thought to be contraindicated; prestroke dependence (i.e. patients with a modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score > 4); life expectancy < 3 months; and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of < 5. Interventions: Participants, allocated by randomisation, received 1 g of an intravenous tranexamic acid bolus followed by an 8-hour 1-g infusion or matching placebo (i.e. 0.9% saline). Main outcome measure: The primary outcome was functional status (death or dependency) at day 90, which was measured by the shift in the mRS score, using ordinal logistic regression, with adjustment for stratification and minimisation criteria. Results: A total of 2325 participants (tranexamic acid, n = 1161; placebo, n = 1164) were recruited from 124 hospitals in 12 countries between 2013 and 2017. Treatment groups were well balanced at baseline. The primary outcome was determined for 2307 participants (tranexamic acid, n = 1152; placebo, n = 1155). There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary outcome of functional status at day 90 [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.03; p = 0.11]. Although there were fewer deaths by day 7 in the tranexamic acid group (aOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99; p = 0.041), there was no difference in case fatality at 90 days (adjusted hazard ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.10; p = 0.37). Fewer patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) after treatment with tranexamic acid than with placebo by days 2 (p = 0.027), 7 (p = 0.020) and 90 (p = 0.039). There was no increase in thromboembolic events or seizures. Limitations: Despite attempts to enrol patients rapidly, the majority of participants were enrolled and treated > 4.5 hours after stroke onset. Pragmatic inclusion criteria led to a heterogeneous population of participants, some of whom had very large strokes. Although 12 countries enrolled participants, the majority (82.1%) were from the UK. Conclusions: Tranexamic acid did not affect a patient's functional status at 90 days after ICH, despite there being significant modest reductions in early death (by 7 days), haematoma expansion and SAEs, which is consistent with an antifibrinolytic effect. Tranexamic acid was safe, with no increase in thromboembolic events. Future work: Future work should focus on enrolling and treating patients early after stroke and identify which participants are most likely to benefit from haemostatic therapy.

Core Competency Gaps Among Governmental Public Health Employees With and Without a Formal Public Health Degree	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE			English	Article						government public health workforce; PH WINS; public health competencies; public health education; workforce development	WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT; STATE; PERCEPTIONS; MASTER; NEEDS	Objectives: To examine the role of a formal public health degree as it relates to core competency needs among governmental public health employees. Design: This cross-sectional study utilizes the 2017 Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey (PH WINS). Bivariate relationships were analyzed by conducting chi(2) tests of respondents' supervisory level and reported skill gaps. Multivariate logistic regressions of reported skill gaps were performed holding gender, age, race/ethnicity, highest degree attained, current employer, role type, tenure in current agency, and public health certificate attainment constant. Setting: Nationally representative sample of government public health employees. Participants: A total of 30 276 governmental public health employees. Main Outcome Measure: Self-reported competency skills gaps. Results: Among nonsupervisors, those with a public health degree had significantly lower odds of reporting a competency gap for 8 of the 21 skills assessed. Among supervisors/managers, those who had a formal public health degree had significantly lower odds of reporting a competency gap in 3 of the 22 skills assessed. Having a degree in public health was not significantly related to an executive's likelihood of reporting a skill gap across any of the 22 skills assessed. Regardless of supervisory level, having a public health degree was not associated with a reduced likelihood of reporting skill gaps in effective communication, budgeting and financial management, or change management competency domains. Conclusions: Possessing a formal public health degree appears to have greater value for skills required at the nonsupervisor and supervisor/manager levels than for skills needed at the executive level. Future work should focus on longitudinal evaluations of skill gaps reported among the public health workforce as changes in public health curricula may shift over time in response to newly revised accreditation standards. In addition, public health education should increase emphasis on communication, budgeting, systems thinking, and other management skills among their graduates.

A questionnaire was prepared and administered to 1125 subjects on a face-to-face basis between March and April 2009. The questionnaire contained 18 items and was designed by the authors and pilot tested on 24 students. It elicited a variety of information about menstruation: The questionnaire also elicited students' socio-demographic information. Students were informed about the aims of the study, and they participated voluntarily in the study. Percentages were used in the evaluation of the data. Results: Female students from the 17-28 age group participated in this research. Conclusions of this study showed that of the 1125 female students, 70.3% could give the right definition of the menstruation. In addition, of the female students, 93% think that 'it's not acceptable to have a sexual intercourse in the menstruation period', 44.4% define 'menstruation as a flow of dirty blood from the body', 65.6% don't accept 'the same organ with which they menstruate and with which they urinate', 27% 'don't have a bath while in menstruation', 27.5% have pain during their menstruation, 60% 'use pills for the ache'. Besides, 98% look forward to having some information about the problems before and after menstruation, and about the physiology and anatomy of menstruation. Conclusions: This study showed that female university students urgently need more information about the 'hygiene and menstruation'.

J	Stephenson, SA; Verity, K; Ashworth, LK; Clements, JA				Stephenson, SA; Verity, K; Ashworth, LK; Clements, JA			Localization of a new prostate-specific antigen-related serine protease gene, <i>KLK4</i>, is evidence for an expanded human kallikrein gene family cluster on chromosome 19q13.3-13.4	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SEQUENCE-ANALYSIS; CDNA; EXPRESSION; LOCUS; IDENTIFICATION; EVOLUTION; PROMOTER; BREAST; CANCER	The human tissue kallikrein (KLK) family of serine proteases, which is important in post-translational processing events, currently consists of just three genes-tissue kallikrein (KLK1), KLK2, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (KLK3)-clustered at chromosome 19q13.3-13.4. We identified an expressed sequence tag from an endometrial carcinoma cDNA library with 50% identity to the three known KLK genes. Primers designed to putative exon 2 and exon 3 regions from this novel kallikrein-related sequence were used to polymerase chain reaction-screen five cosmids spanning 130 kb around the KIK locus on chromosome 19. This new gene, which we have named KLK4, is 25 kb downstream of the KLK2 gene and follows a region that includes two other putative KLK-like gene fragments KLK4 spans 5.2 kb, has an identical genomic structure-five exons and four introns-to the other KLK genes and is transcribed on the reverse strand, in the same direction as KLK1 but opposite to that of KLK2 and KLK3. It encodes a 254-amino acid prepro-serine protease that is most similar (78% identical) to pig enamel matrix serine protease but is also 37% identical to PSA. These data suggest that the human kallikrein gene family locus on chromosome 19 is larger than previously thought and also indicate a greater sequence divergence within this family compared with the highly conserved rodent kallikrein genes.

J	Taleghani, F; Yekta, ZP; Nasrabadi, AN				Taleghani, F; Yekta, ZP; Nasrabadi, AN			Coping with breast cancer in newly diagnosed Iranian women	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						breast cancer; coping; interviews; Iranian women; nursing; qualitative research; research report	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; EXPERIENCE; ADJUSTMENT; STRATEGIES; ILLNESS	Aim. This paper reports a study exploring how Iranian women coped with newly diagnosed breast cancer and provides a foundation for cultural-based care. Backround. Although research has indicated that coping strategies are associated with adaptation to breast cancer, and despite the number of women with newly diagnosed breast cancer increasing each year, there is no information on how Iranian women cope with breast cancer when compared with women of other cultures. Method. In this qualitative study, 19 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer were interviewed during the period May-September 2004 about coping with their disease. Interviews were analysed using a content analysis method. Findings. The main themes emerging from this qualitative study included coping using a religious approach (acceptance of disease as God's will; spiritual fighting), thinking about the disease (positive thinking: positive suggestion, hope, intentional forgetfulness; negative thinking: hopelessness, fear, impaired body image), accepting the fact of the disease (active acceptance; passive acceptance), social and cultural factors and finally finding support from significant others. Conclusion. Understanding how Iranian women cope with diagnosis of breast cancer is important to nurses involved in the process of healing. The majority of strategies used by Iranian women were positive, and religious faith played a major role in this. The findings of the study can be used to design a nursing approach to improve successful coping in Iranian women suffering from breast cancer, and can provide nurses and other healthcare professionals with deeper understanding of these women as they face this diagnosis.

Firstly, the apparent information is processed by using the attention mechanism thought, where the object and search area features are optimized according to the spatial attention and channel attention module. At the same time, the cross-attention module is introduced to process the template branch and search area branch, respectively, which makes full use of the diversified context information of the search area. Then, the background perception correlation filter model with scale adaptation and learning rate adjustment is adopted into the model construction, using as a layer in the network model to realize the object template update. Finally, the optimal object location is determined according to the confidence map with similarity calculation. Experimental results show that the designed method in the paper can promote the object tracking performance under various challenging environments effectively; the success rate increases by 16.2%, and the accuracy rate increases by 16%.

J	Yan, QL				Yan, Qilin			Real-Time Analysis of Youth Emotion Based on Python Language and Smart Sensor Network	MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								Adolescents' emotional changes will have a huge impact on themselves; perhaps, they do not understand themselves. However, according to research, many behaviors of adolescents are often accompanied by emotional changes, and the occurrence of these changes will also bring about their unconsciousness. This article first introduces the research background, significance, and development status of smart home sensors and young people's emotions at home and abroad. This article then gives a detailed introduction to the Python language, intelligent sensor networks, and real-time analysis of youth emotions. In the introduction, it mainly explains the design of the intelligent sensor network system and introduces the system architecture and software and hardware design of the wireless sensor network in detail. In the hardware part, it mainly gives a brief overview of information collection, data transmission, and data processing. In the software part, the embedded software design of three types of network nodes and the control center software design based on Python are given. Finally, the neural network algorithm is used to realize the real-time analysis of young people's emotions, and the recognition rate of multiple algorithms and the data situation of multiple emotional factors are tested at the same time. The results show that the highest recognition rate of 58.4% can be achieved on the validation set of the HAPPEI database after preprocessing, which is higher than the recognition result obtained by directly training the network using the training set of the HAPPEI database.

"It Makes Me Step Back a Little horizontal ellipsis Check Myself": Parental Identity and Mandated Participation among Parents Involved with the Child Welfare System	JOURNAL OF FAMILY VIOLENCE			English	Article						Child welfare system; Parental beliefs; Parental identity; Parenting intervention; Social information processing	MATERNAL SELF-EFFICACY; ENGAGING PARENTS; DATA SATURATION; PROGRAMS; PREVENTION; SERVICES; MOTHERS; INTERVENTION; STRESS; ABUSE	The child welfare system (CWS) is designed to protect children from maltreatment. One avenue through which the CWS aims to do so is by mandating participation in parenting interventions. There are notable challenges associated with mandated services, however, and participant drop out is a key concern. Researchers have examined factors associated with retention, and participants' beliefs about parenting and their parental identity may be linked with intervention engagement. Although theory and research on parental identity is growing, little of this work is specific to parents involved with the CWS. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine parental identity in the context of CWS involvement and mandated services. The study involved analysis of existing qualitative data collected through interviews with 35 parents who participated in a parenting intervention. Interviews were analyzed using a thematic approach guided by open, axial and selective coding principles. Findings identified that parental identity is influenced by CWS and mandated intervention participation through three main themes: (1) Loss of Parental Control Over Parent-Child Interactions, (2) Internal Shifts in Parental Beliefs and Emotions, and parental reflections on the (3) Transmission of Core Values. Each theme represented experiences of identity disruption alongside positive shifts in parental identity, such as enhanced beliefs about self and parental responsibilities. Further, parents described re-evaluating themselves in their role and expressed shifts in thought patterns and perceptions. Results challenge professionals to consider the CWS context as integral to parental identity and encourage researchers to examine parental identity as a mechanism of change.

It has a pivotal role in the pentose phosphate pathway and responsible for catalyzing the isomerization betweend-ribulose 5-phosphate andd-ribose 5-phosphate. In recent years, Rpi has received considerable attention as a multipurpose biocatalyst for production of rare sugars, includingd-allose,l-rhamnulose,l-lyxose, andl-tagatose. Besides, it has been thought of as a potential drug target in the treatment of trypanosomatid-caused diseases such as Chagas' disease, leishmaniasis, and human African trypanosomiasis. Despite increased research activities, up to now, no systematic review of Rpi has been published. To fill this gap, this paper provides detailed information about the enzymatic properties of various Rpis. Furthermore, structural features, catalytic mechanism, and molecular modifications of Rpis are summarized based on extensive crystal structure research. Additionally, the applications of Rpi in rare sugar production and the role of Rpi in trypanocidal drug design are reviewed.

The key contribution of the paper is the presentation of a novel semantic map, namely, a holography map composed of robot, family persons, operable items, local environments, as well as locations and path sections for home service robot cognizing its surroundings and providing services. Inspired by the object-oriented approach, the holography map is divided into three hierarchies of item-room-home and in detail 13 classes of objects. The design and storage of the object-oriented holography map are described comprehensively, and construction of the map is introduced. The execution of robot service based on the object-oriented holography map is discussed briefly. Experiments on real service robot demonstrate that the object-oriented holography map is nearer to human thinking and applicable to indoor robot service tasks.

BRICKxAR/T leverages AR features, including information augmentation, physical-virtual object interplay, and embodied learning, to create a novel and effective visualization experience for learning. In this paper, we evaluated the BRICKxAR/T as a learning intervention using LEGO models for physical and virtual manipulatives in an experiment. The experiment compared AR (N = 29) vs. non-AR (N = 30) learning workshops with pre- and post-tests on Purdue Visualization of Rotations Test and math questions to assess students' learning gains. All participants math scores significantly improved with the AR workshop tending to show greater improvements. The post-workshop survey showed students were inclined to think BRICKxAR/T an interesting and useful application, and they spent more time learning in AR than non-AR.

ISBN 9,780,367,467,890	INTEGRATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Citizenship education; Global citizenship; Inner democracy; Civic education; I-Positions; Social psychology		Citizenship education is a topic of great relevance in a historical period characterized by a strong change in social morphology. There is a shared awareness of the need to cross strict national borders in order to promote a broader sense of citizenship conceived in terms of globality. Hubert Hermans and Rob Bartels in the book Citizenship Education and the Personalization of Democracy, designed for undergraduate and graduate levels in higher education, support these goals by adding a psychological dimension based on the theory of the Dialogical Self. The authors aim to promote not only critical thinking in general, but also self-critical thinking, inviting students to examine the ways they relate to themselves. The book also underlines the personal and social responsibilities that everyone has as a citizen of a wider global community, that of the whole world, which must be preserved and respected from an ecological point of view. For this reason there is a need to develop "ecological identities" aware of being an integral and active part of the planet Earth. The book achieves these objectives through critical information on basic democratic principles, but mainly through the promotion of the personalization of democracy, through the exploration of students' life experiences.

J	Keen, J				Keen, Justin			Digital health care: Cementing centralisation?	HEALTH INFORMATICS JOURNAL			English	Article						Collaborative work practices and IT; health-care policy; health-care service; innovation and IT; modelling health-care services; organisational change and IT		This article reviews large-scale digital developments in the National Health Service in England in recent years and argues that there is a mismatch between digital and organisational thinking and practice. The arguments are based on new institutional thinking, where the digital infrastructure is taken to be an institution, which has been shaped over a long period, and which in turn shapes the behaviour of health professionals, managers and others. Many digital services are still being designed in line with a bureaucratic data processing model. Yet health services are increasingly based on a network model, where health professionals and service managers require information systems that allow them to manage risks proactively and to coordinate multiple services on behalf of patients. This article further argues that the data processing model is being reinforced by Open Data policies and by related developments in the acquisition of genomic and telehealth data, suggesting that the mismatch will persist. There is, therefore, an ongoing tension between frontline and central objectives for digital services. It may be that the tension can only be resolved when - or if - there is trust between the interested parties.

Challenges and opportunities	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						Internet of Things; Blockchain; Smart contract; Trust	BIG DATA; INTERNET; PRIVACY; NETWORK; THINGS; CLOUD	In the Internet of Things (IoT) vision, conventional devices become smart and autonomous. This vision is turning into a reality thanks to advances in technology, but there are still challenges to address, particularly in the security domain e.g., data reliability. Taking into account the predicted evolution of the loT in the coming years, it is necessary to provide confidence in this huge incoming information source. Blockchain has emerged as a key technology that will transform the way in which we share information. Building trust in distributed environments without the need for authorities is a technological advance that has the potential to change many industries, the loT among them. Disruptive technologies such as big data and cloud computing have been leveraged by loT to overcome its limitations since its conception, and we think blockchain will be one of the next ones. This paper focuses on this relationship, investigates challenges in blockchain loT applications, and surveys the most relevant work in order to analyze how blockchain could potentially improve the loT.

Evaluating a Prototype Clinical Decision Support Tool for Chronic Pain Treatment in Primary Care	APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						clinical decision support; pain; chronic; usability	PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES; ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN; TIME	Objectives The Chronic Pain Treatment Tracker (Tx Tracker) is a prototype decision support tool to aid primary care clinicians when caring for patients with chronic noncancer pain. This study evaluated clinicians' perceived utility of Tx Tracker in meeting information needs and identifying treatment options, and preferences for visual design. Methods We conducted 12 semi-structured interviews with primary care clinicians from four health systems in Indiana. The interviews were conducted in two waves, with prototype and interview guide revisions after the first six interviews. The interviews included exploration of Tx Tracker using a think- aloud approach and a clinical scenario. Clinicians were presented with a patient scenario and asked to use Tx Tracker to make a treatment recommendation. Last, participants answered several evaluation questions. Detailed field notes were collected, coded, and thematically analyzed by four analysts. Results;We identified several themes: the need for clinicians to be presented with a comprehensive patient history, the usefulness of Tx Tracker in patient discussions about treatment planning, potential usefulness of Tx Tracker for patients with high uncertainty or risk, potential usefulness of Tx Tracker in aggregating scattered information, variability in expectations about workflows, skepticism about underlying electronic health record data quality, interest in using Tx Tracker to annotate or update information, interest in using Tx Tracker to translate information to clinical action, desire for interface with visual cues for risks, warnings, or treatment options, and desire for interactive functionality. Conclusion Tools like Tx Tracker, by aggregating key information about past, current, and potential future treatments, may help clinicians collaborate with their patients in choosing the best pain treatments. Still, the use and usefulness of Tx Tracker likely relies on continued improvement of its functionality, accurate and complete underlying data, and tailored integration with varying workflows, care team roles, and user preferences.

Quantitative data collected include 32 videos of eight groups of students in four MPS periods that were designed based on a simplified version of Polya's four-stage model, and their worksheets completed in each period. The video data were coded based on a framework with low-level and high-level cognitive behaviors as well as management behaviors and were analyzed using lag sequence analysis from which three types of peer tutoring models were determined: organization-oriented, cognitive-supported, and cognitive-guided. ANOVA analysis showed that the groups with cognitive-guided tutors performed significantly better than the groups guided by cognitive-supported and organization-oriented tutors, between which the performance difference did not reach a significant level. The results of this study suggest that training provided to peer tutors should focus more on how to stimulate high-level cognitive thinking skills than on organization skills.

Due to limited drug selection for osteoporosis and increasing morbidity, mortality of osteoporotic fractures, osteoporosis has become a major health burden in aging societies. Current researches for identifying specific loci or genes involved in osteoporosis contribute to a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and the development of better diagnosis, prevention and treatment strategies. However, little is known about how most causal genes work and interact to influence osteoporosis. Therefore, it is greatly significant to collect and analyze the studies involved in osteoporosis-related genes. Unfortunately, the information about all these osteoporosis-related genes is scattered in a large amount of extensive literature. Currently, there is no specialized database for easily accessing relevant information about osteoporosis-related genes and miRNAs. Methods. We extracted data from literature abstracts in PubMed by text-mining and manual curation. Moreover, a local MySQL database containing all the data was developed with PHP on a Windows server. Results. OsteoporosAtlas (http://biokb.ncpsb.org/osteoporosis/), the first specialized database for easily accessing relevant information such as osteoporosis-related genes and miRNAs, was constructed and served for researchers. OsteoporosAtlas enables users to retrieve, browse and download osteoporosis-related genes and miRNAs. Gene ontology and pathway analyses were integrated into OsteoporosAtlas. It currently includes 617 human encoding genes, 131 human non-coding miRNAs, and 128 functional roles. We think that OsteoporosAtlas will be an important bioinformatics resource to facilitate a better understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and developing better diagnosis, prevention and treatment strategies.

The boundary of the PAR delineates the XY pairing and non-pairing regions, but detailed information about this region is lacking. In this study, we analyzed the sequences adjacent to SlX1 and SlY1 in the dioecious plant Silene latifolia. SlX1 and SlY1, which are linked to the X and Y sex chromosomes, respectively, are thought to be closely linked to the PAR. The Sl-distal-satDNA is a satellite DNA found at the ends of S. latifolia chromosomes. The chromosomal distance between SlX1/SlY1 and Sl-distal-satDNA has not been examined. It was probably almost entire the PAR. However, the region between SlY1 and the Sl-distal-satDNA could be amplified ill PCR. The nucleotide sequence between SlY1 and the Sl-distal-satDNA was determined following PCR amplification and compared to the sequence adjacent to SlX1 using BAC clones. In addition, a new male-specific STS marker, Y202, was designed based oil the sequence adjacent to SlY1. Y202 as well as SlY1 were mapped on the Y chromosome using a panel of deletion mutants and FISH analysis. Our data suggest that the sequences adjacent to SlX1 and SlY1 do not simply follow a gradient of sequence divergence, a feature that was thought to allow the functioning of the PAR boundary. Therefore, recombination suppression in the XY chromosomes probably occurs via other mechanisms.

Design and Participants: Cross-sectional study of 5331 adolescent girls and 3881 adolescent boys (age range, 11.8-18.4 years) in an ongoing cohort study and their mothers. Participants were included in the analysis if both the adolescent and his or her mother returned a questionnaire mailed in 1999 and provided information on weight, height, and weight concerns. Results: More adolescent girls (33.0%) than boys (8.1%) thought frequently about wanting to be thinner. Compared with adolescent girls who accurately perceived that their thinness was not important to their mother, girls who misperceived (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-2.8) or accurately perceived (OR=2.85;95% CI, 1.0-8.4) that it was important to their mother that they be thin were significantly more likely to think frequently about wanting to be thinner. Among the adolescent boys, only those who accurately perceived that it was important to their mother that they not be fat were more likely than their peers to think frequently about wanting to be thinner (OR=3.8 95% CI, 2.3-6.2). Adolescents who accurately perceived that it was important to their mother to be thin or not fat were significantly more likely to be frequent dieters than their peers who accurately perceived that their weight was not important to their mother. Conclusion: Among adolescents, an accurate perception that weight status is important to their mother is associated with thinking frequently about wanting to be thinner and about frequent dieting.

Understanding effective care management implementation in primary care: a macrocognition perspective analysis	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article							RE-AIM FRAMEWORK; CONSOLIDATED FRAMEWORK; MEDICAL HOME; STRATEGIES; PROVIDER	Background: Care management in primary care can be effective in helping patients with chronic disease improve their health status. Primary care practices, however, are often challenged with its implementation. Incorporating care management involves more than a simple physical process redesign to existing clinical care routines. It involves changes to who is working with patients, and consequently such things as who is making decisions, who is sharing patient information, and how. Studying the range of such changes in "knowledge work" during implementation requires a perspective and tools designed to do so. We used the macrocognition perspective, which is designed to understand how individuals think in dynamic, messy real-world environments such as care management implementation. To do so, we used cognitive task analysis to understand implementation in terms of such thinking as decision making, knowledge, and communication. Methods: Data collection involved semi-structured interviews and observations at baseline and at approximately 9 months into implementation at five practices in one physician-owned administratively connected group of practices in the state of Michigan, USA. Practices were intervention participants in a larger trial of chronic care model implementation. Data were transcribed, qualitatively coded and analyzed, initially using an editing approach and then a template approach with macrocognition as a guiding framework. Results: Seventy-four interviews and five observations were completed. There were differences in implementation success across the practices, and these differences in implementation success were well explained by macrocognition. Practices that used more macrocognition functions and used them more often were also more successful in care management implementation. Conclusions: Although care management can introduce many new changes into the delivery of primary care clinical practice, implementing it successfully as a new complex intervention is possible. Macrocognition is a useful perspective for illuminating the elements that facilitate new complex interventions with a view to addressing them during implementation planning.

J	Chu, XL; Sun, BZ; Huang, QC; Zhang, Y				Chu, Xiaoli; Sun, Bingzhen; Huang, Qingchun; Zhang, Yan			Preference degree-based multi-granularity sequential three-way group conflict decisions approach to the integration of TCM and Western medicine	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Multi-granularity; 19-scale; Sequential three-way decision; Group conflict; Medical decision	TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE; ROUGH SET; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; GRANULATION	Medical group conflict decision making is one of the dominant research problems in the field of group consensus decision making. We base the research background on the optimization of clinical diagnosis and treatment in the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine, and propose a novel multi-granularity sequential three-way group conflict decision with preference degree regarding the increment of decision makers and the conflicting characteristics of the decision group. Firstly, we construct a 19-scale multi-granularity conflict preference information system, and then build a generalized conflict decision making granular computing model over this 19-scale conflict information system. Secondly, we establish a sequential three-way group conflict decision making method based on the generalized conflict decision making granular computing model. Furthermore, we define three forms of group conflict result. Meanwhile, we give the definition of preference degree, represent a quantitative presentation of the diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in TCM and Western medicine, conclude trisection result of preference aggregation of each level group, and design an algorithm of multi-granularity sequential three-way group conflict decisions model with preference degree. Thirdly, we apply the proposed model to an example of the clinical decision-making process of TCM and Western medicine. In addition, this paper also presents the following application work, on the one hand, we verified the validity, applicability, and scientificity of the multi-granularity sequential three-way group conflict model. On the other hand, subjective knowledge is quantitatively characterized by an abstract theoretical model, which is scientific significance of the optimization of clinical diagnosis and treatment schemes for such similar diseases, and the weakening or elimination of the conflict between traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine, and the deep integration of TCM and Western medicine. Finally, the research can provide an innovative way of thinking for the development of internationalization and standardization of TCM.

JOURNAL OF BIONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						electromagnetic bionics; electromagnetic protection; electrostatic discharge; synthetic evolved circuits; redundancy; degeneracy	ROBUSTNESS; CHALLENGES; PROTECTION; COMPLEXITY; MODEL	In the ongoing evolutionary process, biological systems have displayed a fundamental and remarkable property of robustness, i.e., the property allows the system to maintain its functions despite external and internal perturbations. Redundancy and degeneracy are thought to be the underlying structural mechanisms of biological robustness. Inspired by this, we explored the proximate cause of the immunity of the synthetic evolved digital circuits to ESD interference and discussed the biological characteristics behind the evolutionary circuits. First, we proposed an evolutionary method for intrinsic immune circuit design. The circuits' immunity was evaluated using the functional fault models based on probability distributions. Then, several benchmark circuits, including ADDER, MAJORITY, and C17, were evolved for high intrinsic immunity. Finally, using the quantitative definitions based on information theory, we measured the topological characteristics of redundancy and degeneracy in the evolved circuits and compared their contributions to the immunity. The results show that redundant elements are necessary for the ESD immune circuit design, whereas degeneracy is the key to making use of the redundancy robustly and efficiently.

J	Roberts, EH				Roberts, EH			A search for pattern and form	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Editorial Material							SEED STORAGE BEHAVIOR; SOYBEAN GLYCINE-MAX; RICE ORYZA-SATIVA; MOISTURE-CONTENT; INTERMEDIATE CATEGORY; DESICCATION-TOLERANCE; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; FLOWERING RESPONSES; CHROMOSOME-DAMAGE; SPRING WHEAT	Seed science is a microcosm of biology which deals with a wide range of hierarchical levels of organization - from molecular biology to population ecology. information at every level accumulates at an alarming rate. Making sense of it all calls for generalizations. Those which enable predictions to be made for circumstances different from those in which the observations were first made are particularly useful. Many scientists approach these problems by searching, consciously or unconsciously, for patterns or forms. Patterns for this purpose are defined here as discontinuities with some measure of repetition, whereas forms are thought of as continuous shapes in two or more dimensions; both can be visualized as spatial structures (most people have difficulty in conceptualising more than three or, at most, four dimensions). If one considers the whole range of hierarchical organization in biology, from molecules to communities, the recognition of the patterns and structures of processes at one hierarchical level of organization may assist in understanding the processes at adjacent levels, but such knowledge may not always be helpful in explaining processes at more remote hierarchical levels where different rules and mechanisms may predominate. Arbitrary curve fitting sometimes has a role in the recognition of the form of processes, but it is usually better to try and discover relationships where the coefficients have some biological meaning. Not only can a search for patterns and forms of processes help in the interpretation of data and the development of new ideas, but it can also sometimes help in the design of experiments. This personal view deals with some examples taken from seed research in the hierarchical levels in which I have been involved - usually somewhere between molecules and ecology.

Methods This was a descriptive cross-sectional design with purposive sampling. Data were collected from semi-structured in-depth interviews with postpartum women diagnosed with hypertensive disorders and who were admitted to the maternity ward of Muhimbili National Hospital. Data were analyzed using NVivo software for qualitative content analysis. Results Fourteen women participated in interviews. Half were primipara and two-thirds had over four antenatal visits. Data analysis yielded four categories and 27 sub-categories. The four categories were: "I'm shocked; I thought I was normal," "The treatment journey," "What health care providers did and did not teach me," "I have a risky future; I hope health care providers can help me." Conclusion Women regarded themselves going from being normal to having a risk through the process of experiencing their treatments. They did not expect to be admitted or referred to a major hospital and while they demanded more information and education, they also expressed appreciation for their health care providers. Education during pregnancy addressing their needs and level of understanding is recommended for improvement of early detection and access to the health service.

Valuing intervention and observation	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Thinking	JUL 22-24, 2004	Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol, Louvain, BELGIUM	Fund Sci Res Flanders, British Psychol Soc	Univ Leuven, Dept Psychol	Causal inference; Contingency table; Intervention	BAYES NETS; CAUSAL; CONTINGENCY; JUDGMENTS; INTEGRATION; INFORMATION	Understanding causal relations is fundamental to effective action but causal data can be confounded. We examined the value that participants placed on data derived from a hypothetical intervention or observation. Our materials involved a possible cause ("bottled water"), a possible confound ("food"), and a context ("a restaurant"). We supposed that participants seek to draw as specific a causal inference as possible from presented data and value information sources more highly that allow them to do so. On this basis, we predicted that in circumstances where an intervention removed the confounding causal factor but observation did not, participants would prefer data derived from an intervention when the possible cause was present (the bottled water was drunk) but show the reverse preference when the possible cause was absent ( the bottled water was not drunk). Experiment 1 confirmed this prediction. Using a between-subjects design, Experiment 2 tested for a difference in confidence in causal judgements given identical data, including data on the confound, as a function of method of data collection (intervention or observation). There was no significant difference in confidence ratings between the two methods but confidence ratings were sensitive to the probability of an effect ( illness) given the cause. Using a within-subjects design, Experiment 3 revealed systematic individual differences in preference for the two methods. Participants were divided between those who considered intervention more confounded and those who considered observation more confounded. Our experiments point to the subtleties of participants' evaluation of data from studies of human beings.

Flexible working memory representation of the relationship between an object and its location as revealed by interactions with attention	ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS			English	Article							SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; VISUAL-SEARCH; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CAPTURE; GUIDANCE; FEATURES; BINDING; CONJUNCTIONS; INTEGRATION; INFORMATION	Working memory (WM) selectively maintains a limited amount of currently relevant information in an active state to influence future perceptual processing, thought, and behavior. The representation of the information held in WM is unknown, particularly the degree of separation between the representation of an object's identity and its location. The present experiments examined the flexibility of object and location WM representations by measuring reaction times on a visual discrimination task during the delay period of a WM recognition task for object identities, locations, or both. The results demonstrate that during WM delay periods, attention is biased toward information that matches the current contents of WM. Attention is not biased toward information that was present in the encoded memory sample but not relevant for the memory recognition test. This specificity of the interaction between WM and attention applies to both the identity and the location of the remembered stimulus and to the relationship between an object and its location. The results suggest that when this relationship is necessary for task performance, WM represents an object and its identity in an integrated manner. However, if this relationship is not task relevant, the object and location information are represented in WM separately.

The continuous maturing and fusion of information and network technologies open a new route for the manufacture of spiral bevel gears. With the consideration of requirements for the fast growth of such industry, this paper proposes a network-based manufacturing model for spiral bevel gears by combining the technologies of gear manufacturing with network, information and management. Firstly, the application integration framework and network communication architecture for spiral bevel gears network-based manufacture is built. On that basis, the business model of integrated platform for spiral bevel gears network-based manufacture is established. Subsequently, the information integration framework of network-based manufacturing processes is set up. Finally, through the network-based manufacturing application experiment and effect analysis, the feasibility of the proposed model, as well as the effectiveness on improving the processing efficiency and quality of such gears is verified.

First-principles study of magnetism and phase stabilities of V<sub>2</sub> based antiferromagnetic Heusler alloys	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; ANISOTROPY; ORDER; V3AL	We investigate the phase stability and magnetism of V 2 based antiferromagnetic semiconductors by first-principles calculations. We first analyze the phase stability of the designed alloys by calculating the convex hull and find that keeping Al atoms in the Z sites is crucial to guarantee the stability against the segregation. The V 2 YAl ( Y = V, Nb, and Ta) systems have relatively small hull distances and Neel temperatures higher than 1000K are evaluated. The strong antiferromagnetic coupling between V atoms is rapidly decreasing with increasing the number of electrons due to the appearance of ferromagnetic double-exchange interaction. By applying a uniaxial strain to induce tetragonal distortion, a relatively large magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy is obtained for V 2TaAl. It is claimed that V 2 YAl are thought to be good candidates for antiferromagnetic spintronics including gate-tunable magnetic properties.

Case study design, a qualitative research method, was employed, and semi-structured and in-depth interviews were conducted with 20 faculty members. The data were analysed through the content analysis method. The faculty members' views were grouped into four themes that are prior knowledge and perceptions of TPACK, instructional practices, professional characteristics, and needs of self-development. According to the results, the faculty members perceived themselves incompetent in terms of TPACK because they thought they had limited knowledge of technology. Although they emphasised that they had sufficient pedagogical knowledge, they were found to use mainly teacher-centred instructional methods by means of PowerPoint presentations. In conclusion, students are positioned as passive recipients of knowledge, there is no interaction outside the classroom and assessment is carried out through traditional methods, and thus faculty members need a professional training program towards TPACK.

This practical element allows an early insight into the real world of engineering, augments student motivation, and enables students to acquire soft skills early. This paper describes a new freshman introduction course into practical engineering, which has been established within the Bachelor of Science curriculum of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology of RWTH Aachen University, Germany. The course is organized as an eight-day, full-time block laboratory for over 300 freshman students, who were supervised by more than 60 tutors from 23 institutes of the Electrical Engineering Department. Based on a threefold learning concept comprising mathematical methods, MATLAB programming, and practical engineering, the students were required to transfer mathematical basics to algorithms in MATLAB in order to control LEGO Mindstorms robots. Toward this end, a new toolbox, called the "RWTH-Mindstorms NXT Toolbox," was developed, which enables the robots to be controlled remotely via MATLAB from a host computer. This paper describes how the laboratory course is organized and how it induces students to think as actual engineers would in solving real-world tasks with limited resources. Evaluation results show that the project improves the students' MATLAB programming skills, enhances motivation, and enables a peer learning process.

J	Nagabhushan, P; Pai, MMM				Nagabhushan, P; Pai, MMM			Cognition of free space for planning the shortest path: A framed free space approach	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						autonomous vehicle; shortest path; framed free space; quad tree; motion planning	OBSTACLES	In this paper, an algorithm incorporating two novel ideas is proposed to improve the time performance of the quad tree-based method for planning the shortest path from a given source to any given destination. One of the novel ideas is to combine the free quads. The strength of this idea lies in the fact that the quads after the total division isolate the free space from the obstacle space. The free quads, which are normally small in size, along the boundary of the obstacles, are combined to form larger free areas. The boundary of every free area is thought of being fenced by a sequence of unit free area cells called frame cells. The size of such a cell is a pixel. The free area together with the frame cells is called framed free space. Thus the entire free space, isolated from the obstacle space, is cognized through the frame cells. The other idea is the adoption of the philosophy of the rectilinear propagation of light rays to trace the shortest path and employ dynamic programming as design strategy to compute the optimal/shortest path through the cognized free area. In the framed free space, all the frame cells hold the information about the shortest distance from it to the source point, computed using the notion of rectilinear propagation of light. The shortest distance from a destination point to a source point is computed using this information. Since the quads are combined to form larger free areas, the number of framed free spaces considered for finding the shortest path is reduced. This in turn reduces the total number of frame cells cognizing the free space so that the total number of frame cells that take part in the computation of the shortest path are drastically reduced. The proposed algorithm works in a 2D static environment with obstacles of any shape and practically unconstrained size of an autonomous vehicle. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This pandemic has stimulated an explosive increase of related studies in various disciplines, including geography, which has contributed to pandemic mitigation with a unique spatiotemporal perspective. Reviewing relevant research has implications for understanding the contribution of geography to COVID-19 research. The sheer volume of publications, however, makes the review work more challenging. Here we use the support vector machine and term frequency-inverse document frequency algorithm to identify geographical studies and bibliometrics to discover primary research themes, accelerating the systematic review of COVID-19 geographical research. We confirmed 1,171 geographical papers about COVID-19 published from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2021, of which a large proportion are in the areas of geographic information systems (GIS) and human geography. We identified four main research themes-the spread of the pandemic, social management, public behavior, and impacts of the pandemic-embodying the contribution of geography. Our findings show the feasibility of machine learning methods in reviewing large-scale literature and highlight the value of geography in the fight against COVID-19. This review could provide references for decision makers to formulate policies combined with spatial thinking and for scholars to find future research directions in which they can strengthen collaboration with geographers.

J	Quan, SN; Qin, Y; Xiang, DL; Wang, W; Wang, XS				Quan, Sinong; Qin, Yao; Xiang, Deliang; Wang, Wei; Wang, Xuesong			Polarimetric Decomposition-Based Unified Manmade Target Scattering Characterization With Mathematical Programming Strategies	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Scattering; Electromagnetic scattering; Mathematical programming; Mathematical model; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Visualization; Shape; Fine polarimetric decomposition; mathematical programming (MP); polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR); unified scattering characterization	POLARIZATION ORIENTATION SHIFTS; MODEL-BASED DECOMPOSITION; COHERENCY MATRIX; AREA EXTRACTION; POLSAR DATA	Due to the orientation variation and structural complexity, designing generalized and unified features to highlight manmade target scattering from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data is challenging. Inspired by the thought of mathematical programming (MP) and coupled with the model-based decomposition, this article proposes two polarimetric features: scattering contribution combiner (SCC) and scattering contribution angle (SCA) for unified scattering characterization of manmade targets. To this end, a rotated dihedral scattering model is first constructed concerning the analogous difference reciprocal and sigmoid function transformations, which adequately reflects the transition of co- and cross-pol responses caused by the orientation variation. Along with the dipole-like compound scattering models and through designing a discriminant-based model solution method, a fine eight-component decomposition using full polarimetric information is proposed. Through skillfully employing the MP strategies, the proposed decomposition achieves the physical optimization of scattering modeling and reasonable inversion of model parameters. Thus, it can accurately describe the local structure scattering and remarkably improve the overestimation of volume scattering. Subsequently, by analyzing the significance distribution on targets of different scattering mechanisms, the SCC is constructed via the linear/nonlinear combination of scattering contributions on the one hand. On the other hand, by further mining the information implied in the scattering contributions, the SCA is proposed with the strategy of trigonometric function transformation. Experimental results conducted on real PolSAR data not only demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the constructed features but also exhibit a clear advantage of fine polarimetric decomposition in scattering understanding, which encourages the use of them for further applications.

One way to facilitate occupational therapy undergraduate students transferring their academic skills of data gathering and analysis to professional settings is to ensure they can competently use diagnostic reasoning. Nevertheless, there are several obvious gaps in empirical evidence related to the learning and development of this style of reasoning in occupational therapy undergraduates. The most important are related to promoting higher-order thinking and the use of information to solve problems in the context of professional practice. This study analyses undergraduates' diagnostic reasoning and its changes during their education.Materials and Methods. This multicentre study was conducted with a descriptive observational design. The study took place at the University of Coruna (Spain), University of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain), and University of el Valle (Colombia). The sample wasn=247. For data collection, a clinical case was specifically designed. IBM SPSS Statistics (v19) and EPIDAT 3.1 were used for the data analysis.Results. Participants identified and categorized occupational performance problems. However, they had difficulties when identifying and categorizing the occupational performance components (specifically, the symptoms and signs of the disease presented in the study case). They presented limitations to analyse and synthesize the information collected to develop an explanation of the occupational problems and their causes.Conclusions. Undergraduate students' ability to analyse and synthesize information during data collection is poorly organized, so it makes the problem formulation difficult. This study contributes to the knowledge of undergraduates' diagnostic reasoning features, specifically the undergraduate students' capacities and limits to process information during the occupational assessment.

Key components of shared decision making models: a systematic review	BMJ OPEN			English	Review							MEDICAL ENCOUNTER; PRIMARY-CARE; PATIENT; FRAMEWORK; OPPORTUNITIES; NEEDS; TIME	Objectives To (1) provide an up-to-date overview of shared decision making (SDM)-models, (2) give insight in the prominence of components present in SDM-models, (3) describe who is identified as responsible within the components (patient, healthcare professional, both, none), (4) show the occurrence of SDM-components over time, and (5) present an SDM-map to identify SDM-components seen as key, per healthcare setting. Design Systematic review. Eligibility criteria Peer-reviewed articles in English presenting a new or adapted model of SDM. Information sources Academic Search Premier, Cochrane, Embase, Emcare, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science were systematically searched for articles published up to and including September 2, 2019. Results Forty articles were included, each describing a unique SDM-model. Twelve models were generic, the others were specific to a healthcare setting. Fourteen were based on empirical data, 26 primarily on analytical thinking. Fifty-three different elements were identified and clustered into 24 components. Overall, Describe treatment options was the most prominent component across models. Components present in >50% of models were: Make the decision (75%), Patient preferences (65%), Tailor information (65%), Deliberate (58%), Create choice awareness (55%), and Learn about the patient (53%). In the majority of the models (27/40), both healthcare professional and patient were identified as actors. Over time, Describe treatment options and Make the decision are the two components which are present in most models in any time period. Create choice awareness stood out for being present in a markedly larger proportion of models over time. Conclusions This review provides an up-to-date overview of SDM-models, showing that SDM-models quite consistently share some components but that a unified view on what SDM is, is still lacking. Clarity about what SDM constitutes is essential though for implementation, assessment, and research purposes. A map is offered to identify SDM-components seen as key.

J	Cho, C; Park, J; Sakhakarmi, S				Cho, Chunhee; Park, Jeewoong; Sakhakarmi, Sayan			Emergency response: Effect of human detection resolution on risks during indoor mass shooting events	SAFETY SCIENCE			English	Article						Emergency; Terror; Safety; Awareness; Sensing; Intelligent system	BUILDING INFORMATION MODELS; HAZARD IDENTIFICATION; PEDESTRIAN TRACKING; MENTAL-ILLNESS; BIM; EVACUATION; SAFETY; PREVENTION; SYSTEM; SCHOOL	During an emergency, people rely on a few behavioral rules to save themselves. However, these rules may not be reliable, especially in indoor environments, as they are not fully aware of site information and their ability to think properly becomes fragile. Despite the increasing occurrence of mass shootings, there is no advanced systematic mechanism, which leverages recent technological advancements, in place to save people from this terror. To overcome these challenges, this research explores an integrated approach by combining resources (human monitoring; building information; and agent-based modeling). This research is to ameliorate public safety by investigating mass shooting scenarios through integration. Specifically, this study unveils the effect of sensory data on fatalities, along with safety mechanisms offered by systematic action plans. We designed six scenarios by varying spatial sensing coverage (comprehensive visual representation of the situation) from 0% to 100%. Each scenario was tested from 2000 to 2500 times to obtain statistical significance. Results indicate that even low sensing coverages (20% and 40%) show a slight improvement for safe evacuation and clear potential to reduce casualties within the first five minutes. Significant improvements are found in all cases (safe evacuation, casualties, rescuing people, and total survival) when the sensing coverages are high, around 60% to 100%. This study confirms the applicability of an integrated approach to identify a safety mechanism operating in place during a mass shooting incident. The findings could serve as a basis for future studies that can progressively improve emergency safety mechanisms based on available site resources.

The objective of the current study was to determine whether childhood victimization increases risk for adult pain complaints, using prospective information from documented cases of child abuse and neglect. Using a prospective cohort design, cases of early childhood abuse or neglect documented between 1967 and 1971 (n = 676) and demographically matched controls (n = 520) were followed into young adulthood. The number of medically explained and unexplained pain complaints reported at follow-up (1989-1995) was examined. Assessed prospectively. physically and sexually abused and neglected individuals were not at risk for increased pain symptoms. The odds of reporting one or more unexplained pain symptoms was not associated with any childhood victimization or specific types (i.e. sexual abuse, physical abuse. or neglect). In contrast, the odds of one or more unexplained pain symptoms was significantly associated with retrospective self-reports of all specific types of childhood victimization. These findings indicate that the relationship between childhood victimization and pain symptoms in adulthood is more complex than previously thought. The common assumption that medically unexplained pain is of psychological origin should be questioned. Additional research conducting comprehensive physical examinations with victims of childhood abuse and neglect is recommended. (C) 2001 International Association for the Study of Pain.

J	Gualandi, B; Pareschi, L; Peroni, S				Gualandi, Bianca; Pareschi, Luca; Peroni, Silvio			What do we mean by "data"? A proposed classification of data types in the arts and humanities	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Research data management; FAIR principles; Survey; Humanities; Grounded theory approach		PurposeThis article describes the interviews the authors conducted in late 2021 with 19 researchers at the Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies at the University of Bologna. The main purpose was to shed light on the definition of the word "data" in the humanities domain, as far as FAIR data management practices are concerned, and on what researchers think of the term.Design/methodology/approachThe authors invited one researcher for each of the official disciplinary areas represented within the department and all 19 accepted to participate in the study. Participants were then divided into five main research areas: philology and literary criticism, language and linguistics, history of art, computer science and archival studies. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using a grounded theory approach.FindingsA list of 13 research data types has been compiled thanks to the information collected from participants. The term "data" does not emerge as especially problematic, although a good deal of confusion remains. Looking at current research management practices, methodologies and teamwork appear more central than previously reported.Originality/valueOur findings confirm that "data" within the FAIR framework should include all types of inputs and outputs humanities research work with, including publications. Also, the participants of this study appear ready for a discussion around making their research data FAIR: they do not find the terminology particularly problematic, while they rely on precise and recognised methodologies, as well as on sharing and collaboration with colleagues.

J	Sun, WJ; Han, P; Pei, SH				Sun, Wenjuan; Han, Ping; Pei, Shaohua			Mathematical Model Construction of Network Computer Test Automation System for College English Teaching	SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING			English	Article							STUDENTS	Networked education represents a development direction of educational reform, has become a feature of modern education, and has formed a new impetus to the development of education. The change from paper-and-pencil examinations to computer network-based machine examinations is not only a reform of the content and form of the University English Level 4 and 6 examinations, but also a reflection of the reform of the comprehensive assessment system and teaching philosophy of University English teaching. Promoting the development and construction of online college English examination systems in universities, applying machine examinations to various types of tests and formal examinations for college English teaching, and updating the college English question bank through continuous accumulation of professional teachers will have very high research value and practical value in improving the quality of examinations and promoting the standardization of college English examinations. In order to show the individualized chemistry report simultaneously, it is necessary to further ask relevant subject experts, educational measurement experts, and front-line teachers to expand the question attributes; that is, the question attributes extend to module specific knowledge points, cognitive levels, and information literacy ability levels, while most of the pages are combined with Ajax technology to reduce hardware resource dependency and optimize software performance. The paper analyzes the requirements analysis and overall design of the online college English examination system, including the design objectives, design principles, functional design, core algorithm design, architecture design, database design, and security design. The main functions of the online college English examination system, such as personal information management, question bank information management, test paper grouping management, online examination management, paper marking management, and system setting management, are discussed in detail. The main functions of the system, such as personal information management, question bank information management, test paper grouping management, online test management, mark and approve management, and system setting management, are discussed in detail, and the performance test and some function test of the system are also briefly discussed. The whole research process involves the identification of test questions and their attributes in the construction of the question bank, the construction of the adaptive test system, the comprehensive analysis of the mock test results, and the thinking about the application of the high school adaptive academic level test.

Based on the hypothesis that polymorphic HLA-DP variants can restrict T-cell responses to infection, we previously compared DP supertype frequencies in BCP ALL patients with that of unrelated newborn controls. We reported that the DP2 supertype was associated with susceptibility, whereas DP1 was associated with protection. However, the association of genetic variants in children with early-onset diseases such as ALL may be a proxy for parental effects. Here we examine whether maternal DP1 and DP2 are associated with BCP ALL by fitting log-linear models in a combined series of family triads (both parent; and case child) and dyads (1 parent and case child; n = 571) in comparison with similar models in non-BCP leukemia (n = 198). We report no evidence of maternal DP1 or DP2 associations with BCP ALL but we did identify suggestive evidence of maternal undertransmission of the infrequent supertypes DP11 and DP15. Although these results require confirmation, they suggest that DP11 and DP15 may be protective or that there is transmission ratio distortion of these supertypes in BCP ALL (C) 2011 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.

J	Gordon, JA; Oriol, NE; Cooper, JB				Gordon, JA; Oriol, NE; Cooper, JB			Bringing good teaching cases "to life": A simulator-based medical education service	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article								Realistic medical simulation has expanded worldwide over the last decade. Such technology is playing an increasing role in medical education not merely because simulator sessions are enjoyable, but because they can provide an enhanced environment for experiential learning and reflective thought. High-fidelity patient simulators allow students of all levels to "practice" medicine without risk, providing a natural framework for the integration of basic and clinical science in a safe environment. Often described as "flight simulation for doctors," the rationale, utility, and range of medical simulations have been described elsewhere, yet the challenges of integrating this technology into the medical school curriculum have received little attention. The authors report how Harvard Medical School established an on-campus simulator program for students in 2001, building on the work of the Center for Medical Simulation in Boston. As an overarching structure for the process, faculty and residents developed a simulator-based "medical education service"-like any other medical teaching service, but designed exclusively to help students learn on the simulator alongside a clinician-mentor, on demand. Initial evaluations among both preclinical and clinical students suggest that simulation is highly accepted and increasingly demanded. For some learners, simulation may allow complex information to be understood and retained more efficiently than can occur with traditional methods. Moreover, the process outlined here suggests that simulation can be integrated into existing curricula of almost any medical school or teaching hospital in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

Professional nurses must be curious, investigative, and open to learning as well as practice critical and analytic thinking to sustain their professionalism. Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the attitudes of nursing students toward scientific research. Methods: A descriptive and cross-sectional study design was used. This study was conducted at a nursing department of a university in Turkey. A sample of 375 nursing students participated. Data were collected using the "Personal Information Form'' and "Attitude Scale towards Scientific Studies.'' Standard descriptive statistical methods, correlation, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, and post hoc Bonferroni were used in data analysis. Results: Nearly all (90.1%) of the participants were female, and 33.9% were sophomore (second-year) students. Junior (third-year) students held the most positive attitudes toward research, as compared with the participants in other academic years. Participants who had participated in scientific activities held more positive attitudes toward research than those who had not. Participants who had prior experience doing scientific research showed more positive attitudes toward research and researchers than those without this experience. Being older, having scientific research experience, following the continuous broadcasts related to nursing, and participating in scientific activities all significantly influenced attitude toward research (p<.05). Conclusions/Implications for Practice: Although nursing students who participated in this study exhibited generally positive attitudes toward scientific research, they had relatively little experience participating in scientific activities. Therefore, to foster a positive scientific research culture among undergraduate students, grants should be provided that encourage wider participation in scientific activities and offer opportunities for undergraduate students to do scientific research.

The Mexican Carbon Capture and Storage Platform: Construction of a boundary object for bridging the gaps between contexts, actors, and disciplines	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL			English	Article						CCS/CCUS; Communication platform; Mexico; Boundary objects; Stakeholders	KNOWLEDGE; COMMUNITIES; FRAMEWORK; IMPACT	Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a technology identified as a potential solution to mitigate climate change by reducing carbon emissions from large-scale emitters. If CCS is expected to be adopted globally, transparent and reliable data and information must be readily attainable to all stakeholders to support the technology choice and decision-making process. The implementation of CCS requires effective communication and collaboration strategies. Still, materials and communication platforms to inform stakeholders about the potential and contribution of CCS are predominantly accessible in English since ongoing projects are mainly located in English-speaking countries. The Mexican Carbon Capture and Storage platform (MeCCS) was developed as a digital sharing and learning space for national stakeholders to obtain and expand their knowledge about CCS technology in Spanish. It was constructed as a boundary object (BO) to bridge different communities and disciplines, facilitating communication, understanding, and cooperation. The platform includes diverse elements that combine science and art to produce dissemination materials for different audiences to help build critical thinking and inform them about CCS technology. The platform confirmed its capacity to transfer and translate knowledge one year after its launch. It also served to connect different audiences in Mexico and globally and identify further areas of research and CCS-related efforts.

The objective was to obtain user feedback to guide the design and development of a mobile app, consistent with the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) framework. Methods Twenty-six women (22-62 years) provided mobile app feedback using a Design Thinking framework and grounded theory approach. Four focus groups (2 h each) and two sets of one-to-one interviews (1 h each) were held from May 2018 to October 2019. The researchers debriefed the focus groups and interviews, and undertook analysis based on project objectives and key questions. Results Recurring themes throughout the study aligned with sections of the MARS: (A) engagement (e.g., progress tracking), (B) functionality (e.g., intuitive interface), (C) aesthetics (e.g., smart graphics and colors), (D) information (e.g., clear, concise information). An internal preliminary assessment determined a MARS Quality Mean Score of 4.1 of 5 (engagement: 3.6 of 5; functionality: 4 of 5; aesthetics: 4.3 of 5: information: 4.4 of 5). Conclusions The development of the mobile app is on track to meet MARS requirements, and to be a fun, motivating app for women. Future work is required to investigate its efficacy.

Healthcare improvement as planned system change or complex responsive processes? a longitudinal case study in general practice	BMC FAMILY PRACTICE			English	Article						General practice; Quality improvement; Complexity; Organisational change	IMPROVING PRIMARY-CARE; QUALITY IMPROVEMENT; CHRONIC ILLNESS	Background: Interest in how to implement evidence-based practices into routine health care has never been greater. Primary care faces challenges in managing the increasing burden of chronic disease in an ageing population. Reliable prescriptions for translating knowledge into practice, however, remain elusive, despite intense research and publication activity. This study seeks to explore this dilemma in general practice by challenging the current way of thinking about healthcare improvement and asking what can be learned by looking at change through a complexity lens. Methods: This paper reports the local level of an embedded case study of organisational change for better chronic illness care over more than a decade. We used interviews, document review and direct observation to explore how improved chronic illness care developed in one practice. This formed a critical case to compare, using pattern matching logic, to the common prescription for local implementation of best evidence and a rival explanation drawn from complexity sciences interpreted through modern sociology and psychology. Results : The practice changed continuously over more than a decade to deliver better chronic illness care in line with research findings and policy initiatives - re-designing care processes, developing community linkages, supporting patient self-management, using guidelines and clinical information systems, and integrating nurses into the practice team. None of these improvements was designed and implemented according to an explicit plan in response to a documented gap in chronic disease care. The process that led to high quality chronic illness care exhibited clear complexity elements of co-evolution, non-linearity, self-organisation, emergence and edge of chaos dynamics in a network of agents and relationships where a stable yet evolving way of organizing emerged from local level communicative interaction, power relating and values based choices. Conclusions: The current discourse of implementation science as planned system change did not match organisational reality in this critical case of improvement in general practice. Complexity concepts translated in human terms as complex responsive processes of relating fit the pattern of change more accurately. They do not provide just another fashionable blueprint for change but inform how researchers, policymakers and providers participate in improving healthcare.

Despite the large number of biobanking initiatives in obstetric populations around the world, there is no published research that examines what pregnant women understand about enrollment into such programs and what their attitudes and beliefs are toward the research and its potential outcomes. Postpartum women 18 years or older who delivered at the University of Chicago Hospitals and had live infants on the General Care Nursery service were approached about participating in a survey about the CLIPP biobank and about a hypothetical pediatric biobank. Ninety-three women who had been recruited to participate in CLIPP agreed to participate in this research. Sixty-three women (68%) had previously agreed to participate in CLIPP; and 30 (32%) had refused. Both participants and non-participants understood that CLIPP had the main goal of advancing science, although almost one-half of the respondents thought that participation in CLIPP would benefit the individual participants. Eighty-five (92%) correctly believed that the research team would keep the medical information private. There was widespread optimism that the research Would yield significant results. importantly, there was no difference in these beliefs between those who enrolled and those who did not enroll in CLIPP. While education and socioeconomic status correlated with greater understanding about the methods and goals of the program, greater understanding did not cot-relate with willingness to participate. Our survey found widespread willingness to enroll in a pregnancy-focused biobank and optimism that the results will yield significant benefits. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

This paper reports views and experiences of the women who participated in the trial (261 randomised), based on data from two self-completed questionnaires.MethodsWomen were given or posted the first questionnairebetween 4 and 8 weeks after birth, and posted a second similar questionnaire at 1 year. Both questionnaires included three questions about experiences of participating in the trial: (1) If time suddenly went backwards and you had to do it all over again, would you agree to participate in the Cord Pilot Trial?; (2) Please tell us if there was anything about the Cord Pilot Trial that you think could have been done better; and (3) Please tell us if there was anything about the Cord Pilot Trial, or your experiences of joining the trial, that you think were particularly good.ResultsOne hundred and eighty-six women completed the first questionnaire and 133 completed the second. At both time points, 90% responded probably or definitely to participating in the trial again. More women randomised to deferred clamping responded definitely yes than those allocated immediate clamping (78% versus 67% first questionnaire). Women were positive about the level of information and explanations, the friendly and caring staff, and the benefits for their baby and others as a result of participating in the trial. Suggestions for how the trial could be done better included being approached earlier, better staff communication about the trial, more information overall, and better timing of follow-up.ConclusionsWomen were largely positive about participating in the trial. Nevertheless, they had suggestions for how the study could have been improved. These suggestions have implications for the design of future trials.Trial registrationISRCTN21456601.

So far, the ability to detect and respond to floral humidity cues has been only established for hawkmoths when they locate and extract nectar while hovering in front of some moth-pollinated flowers. To test whether floral humidity can be used by other more widespread generalist pollinators, we designed artificial flowers that presented biologically relevant levels of humidity similar to those shown by flowering plants. Bumblebees showed a spontaneous preference for flowers that produced higher floral humidity. Furthermore, learning experiments showed that bumblebees are able to use differences in floral humidity to distinguish between rewarding and non-rewarding flowers. Our results indicate that bumblebees are sensitive to different levels of floral humidity. In this way floral humidity can add to the information provided by flowers and could impact pollinator behaviour more significantly than previously thought.	[Harrap, Michael J.

Notably, the lack of historic field-based research holds two important implications: (1) large knowledge gaps regarding environmental factors influencingE. coli'ssurvival in the environment exist; and (2) the efficacy of implemented management strategies have rarely been assessed on larger field scales, thus leaving their actual impact(s) largely unknown. Moreover, the persistence ofE. coliin the environment calls into question its widespread and frequent use as a fecal indicator microorganism. To address these shortcomings, future work should include more field-based studies, occurring in diverse physiographical regions and over larger spatial extents. This information will provide scientists and land-use managers with a new understanding regarding factors influencingE. coliconcentrations in its secondary habitat, thereby providing insight to address problematic fecal contamination effectively.

To ensure the quality of STEM in-struction, countries worldwide have launched STEM teacher professional development (TPD) programs. It is paramount to know how these programs have been implemented and what lessons can be learned from them. In this study, to capture the trends in publications on K-12 STEM TPD, we systematically reviewed relevant journal papers published in the Web of Science database from 2006 to 2020. We analyzed the (1) knowledge foci, (2) professional development ap-proaches, (3) outcome measurements, as well as (4) data sources of the STEM TPDs. In addition, to inform future professional development designs, we selected and developed narrative de-scriptions of three exemplary cases. These cases showcased high-quality TPD and covered pre -service and in-service teachers in formal and informal settings. We reviewed the knowledge foci of the STEM TPDs using the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) frame-work. The results showed that the types of knowledge delivered in the STEM TPD programs were mostly pedagogical knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge, while a certain number of programs focused on technological content knowledge and technological pedagogical content knowledge. Most of the studies adopted mixed professional development approaches, featuring activities like learning by design, learning by doing, reflective learning, and group work. These approaches emphasized the active participation of teachers in the process, built links between content and classroom practices, and encouraged collective participation in developing expertise. However, the data were mostly collected through interviews or survey instruments. Future research should move beyond analyzing data on teachers' perceptions to explore processes (e.g., online participation logs, teacher-peer interactions) and products of performance (e.g., lesson plans, handmade crafts) to further examine the effects of STEM TPD activities. It would also be desirable to establish greater consistency in data collection approaches, such as by using validated interview or observation protocols that are generalizable to different school settings.

Transduction of these signals into microwave signal oscillations can enable wireless sensors that report on brain activity through magnetic induction. In this letter, we demonstrate that action potentials from the lateral giant neurons of crayfish can induce microwave oscillations in nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions (NMTJs). We show that action potentials activate microwave oscillations in NMTJs with an amplitude that follows the action potential signal, demonstrating that the device has both the sensitivity and temporal resolution to respond to action potentials from a single neuron. The activation of magnetic oscillations by action potentials, together with the small surface area and the high-frequency tunability, makes these devices potential candidates for high-resolution sensing of bioelectric signals from neural tissues. These device attributes may be useful for the design of high-throughput bidirectional brain-machine interfaces.

Design: PubMed and Google Scholar searches were conducted to identify the relevant studies on pathogenesis of uterine leiomyoma, which are hereby reviewed and discussed. Setting: Academic medical center. Patient(s): Not applicable. Intervention(s): Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure(s): Not applicable. Result(s): To date, the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyomas is not well understood. However, genetic alterations (especially MED12 and HMGA2) and involvement of epigenetic mechanisms (DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNA) in leiomyoma provide the clue of initiator of this tumor. Estrogens and P are considered as promoters of leiomyoma growth, and growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines are thought to be as potential effectors of estrogens and P. Extracellular matrix components are a major structural part of leiomyoma tissue that are abnormally orientated and can modify mechanical stress on cells, which leads to activation of internal mechanical signaling and may contribute to leiomyoma growth. Conclusion(s): Besides many genetics and epigenetic factors, the important link among the sex steroids, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix and their involvement in cell proliferation, fibrotic processes, apoptosis, and angiogenesis are implicating a complex network in leiomyoma formation and growth. Those findings could provide information to establish future therapeutic options for the management of this tumor. (C)2013 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Design Qualitative interview study with a purposive sample. Setting Great Britain. Participants 52 men with suspected or confirmed prostate cancer, recruited through general practitioners, urologists, patient support groups, and charities. Results Almost all men remembered their prostate specific antigen test but recalled being given little information beforehand. Arguments in favour of increased access to testing included the belief that early diagnosis would reduce mortality, improve quality of life, and save the NHS money. Men also thought that a national screening programme should be available because symptoms can be ambiguous, screening for cancer is responsible health behaviour, and screening would encourage men to be tested. Four men who opposed a screening programme had gathered information alerting them to uncertainty about the benefits of treatment, and two regretted that they had been tested., Others thought that access to testing is restricted in the United Kingdom because of a lack of government backing, concerns about the accuracy of the test, and a lack of resources. Conclusions The few men in this study who subscribed to the argument that evidence of the benefits of treatment is a prerequisite for a screening programme did not want to see screening introduced. Men who proposed an alternative set of principles for testing gave reasons that did not all relate to overoptimism about the benefits of early diagnosis. People who plan services and people who respond to requests for testing need to understand men's perspectives and concerns.

IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Flexible cystoscopy; Informed consent; Questionnaire		Background Informed consent is an integral part of the process prior to any surgical procedure [1]. Flexible cystoscopy is a common day case urological procedure and it is the gold standard investigation for visible haematuria [2]. Aim To assess if postal consent is a suitable form of gaining informed consent for flexible cystoscopy. Methods Patients booked for a flexible cystoscopy are initially reviewed in clinic. An information leaflet with an attached consent form is then posted to their home 2 weeks prior to their procedure. We designed a short questionnaire, to assess patient's satisfaction and understanding of the literature, given to them after the procedure. Results Sixty-seven questionnaires were completed. The mean age was 54. Sixty patients (93%) think that postal consent is of benefit to the patient. Sixty-one patients (91%) read the information sheet and felt that there was enough information regarding the procedure on it. Fifty-four patients (81%) had no difficulty understanding the consent form. Forty patients (60%) signed the form prior to arrival in the hospital. Conclusion Postal consent is commonly used for gastro-intestinal endoscopy procedures. Postal consent for flexible cystoscopy is not well reported in the literature. Our study shows postal consent to be a suitable form of gaining informed consent for flexible cystoscopy.

DNA could provide alternative substrates for computing and storage as existing ones approach physical limits. In this paper, we explore the implications of this trend in computer architecture. We present a computer systems perspective on molecular processing and storage, positing a hybrid molecular- electronic architecture that plays to the strengths of both domains. We cover the design and implementation of all stages of the pipeline: encoding, DNA synthesis, system integration with digital microfluidics, DNA sequencing (including emerging technologies such as nanopores), and decoding. We first draw on our experience designing a DNA-based archival storage system, which includes the largest demonstration to date of DNA digital data storage of over three billion nucleotides encoding over 400 MB of data. We then propose a more ambitious hybrid-electronic design that uses a molecular form of near-data processing for massive parallelism. We present a model that demonstrates the feasibility of these systems in the near future. We think the time is ripe to consider molecular storage seriously and explore system designs and architectural implications.

Reliability Generalization of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire: A Meta-Analytic View of Reliability Estimates	SAGE OPEN			English	Article						educational research; education; social sciences; reliability and validity; research methods; social sciences; Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire; measurement and scaling methods; research methodology and design	ACADEMIC SELF-REGULATION; MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS; RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS; ACHIEVEMENT GOALS; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; CRITICAL THINKING; EPISTEMOLOGICAL BELIEFS; INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; SCORE RELIABILITY; MEDIATING ROLE	A reliability generalization meta-analysis was performed to explore the relationship between study factors and levels of alpha reliability for the 15 subscales of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). The MSLQ has been widely adapted over the past 25 years to investigate the role of motivation and strategies in learning, primarily at the postsecondary level. A literature search from the years 1991 to 2015 yielded 295 peer-reviewed journal articles and 1,369 alpha reliability coefficients. Articles were coded for six potential moderator study variables. A novel varying coefficient (VC) model was adopted to determine average reliabilities across studies for each subscale and to perform multiple regression analyses to identify study variables that may moderate alpha reliability estimates. Commonality analyses were used to aid in interpretation of regression results. Meta-analyzed alpha reliabilities were lower than values published in the test manual for all but three of the subscales. Ability of specific moderators to predict score reliability varied across subscales; however, studies in North America, in English, or using a 7-point response scale generally corresponded to increased reliability estimates. Knowledge of expected levels of score reliability under varying sample and study conditions may provide useful information for researchers planning future use of the MSLQ.

Recent studies on Optane DIMM-based systems unveil discrepant performance characteristics, compared with what many researchers thought before the product release. To thoroughly analyze the source of the discrepancy and facilitate real-NVRAM-aware system design, we develop an NVRAM microarchitecture characterization and modeling framework, consisting of a Low-level profilEr for Non-volatile memory Systems (LENS) and a Validated cycle-Accurate NVRAM Simulator (VANS). LENS allows users to comprehensively analyze NVRAM performance attributes and reverse engineer NVRAM microarchitectures. We use LENS to reverse engineer the sophisticated microarchitecture design of Optane DIMM and generate a set of architecture implications of industrial NVRAMs. VANS models Optane DIMM microarchitecture and is validated by comparing with the detailed performance characteristics of Optane DIMM-attached servers. VANS adopts a modular design that can be easily modified to extend to other NVRAM architecture designs.

J	SAARILUOMA, P; SAJANIEMI, J				SAARILUOMA, P; SAJANIEMI, J			TRANSFORMING VERBAL DESCRIPTIONS INTO MATHEMATICAL FORMULAS IN SPREADSHEET CALCULATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article							MENTAL CALCULATION; ABACUS; IMAGERY	A common subtask in spreadsheet calculation is the transformation of verbal task instructions into spreadsheet formulas. This task can be used to study the relation of imagery to thinking. Research using physics and mathematics problems has indicated that mental transformation from verbal to mathematical representations is not necessarily direct but is intermediated by imagery. Therefore, a human-computer interaction task such as spreadsheet calculation provides a good task environment for analysing mental imagery operations, the role of imagery operations, and the role of intermediate imagery in thinking tasks. Testing the use of imagery in spreadsheet calculations also improves our understanding of representational systems used in this specific task and in user interfaces in general. Four experiments provided different types of evidence for the intermediate imagery hypothesis, which means that subjects do not directly transform verbal instructions into spreadsheet formulas. They first try to code an overall image of the areas referred to by verbal instructions, segment it into suitable fields, and only thereafter do they write down the set of formulas which best extract the information demanded. Typically, the field borders, used in this segmentation are often imagined and are not presented at all in the original verbal task instructions. Intermediate imagery is a relevant notion in discussing the construction of user models because the most important current models, such as GOMS, assume only propositional representations. Also, the use of images should be taken into account in designing spreadsheet packages by providing features which aid analog information processing.

Design and Methods This descriptive, correlational, and cross-sectional study was conducted with 359 nursing students. Data were collected using the Sociodemographic Information Form, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Cognitive Distortions Scale (CDS), and Sense of Coherence (SOC). Findings A positive correlation between CTQ and CDS and a negative correlation between CTQ and SOC were determined (p < 0.05). It was concluded that the CTQ sexual abuse variable had a significant (p = 0.008) effect on the SOC meaningfulness subscale. Practice implications It is thought that it is essential to strengthen nursing students in terms of childhood traumatic experiences, and the sense of coherence will contribute positively to this situation.

Crystal structures reported very different conformations for the functionally important C-terminal segment of the NS2B cofactor (NS2Bc), indicating open and closed conformations in the absence and presence of inhibitors, respectively. An earlier NMR study in solution indicated that a closed state is the preferred conformation in the absence of an artificial linker engineered between NS2B and NS3pro. To obtain direct structural information on the fold of unlinked NS2B-NS3pro in solution, we tagged NS3pro with paramagnetic tags and measured pseudocontact shifts by NMR to position NS2Bc relative to NS3pro. NS2Bc was found to bind to NS3pro in the same way as reported in a previously published model and crystal structure of the closed state. The structure is destabilized, however, by high ionic strength and basic pH, showing the importance of electrostatic forces to tie NS2Bc to NS3pro. Narrow NMR signals previously thought to represent the open state are associated with protein degradation. In conclusion, the closed conformation of the NS2B-NS3 protease is the best model for structure-guided drug design.

J	Wang, L; Xu, QG; Chen, Y; Zhu, ZH; Cao, YL				Wang, Lin; Xu, Qinguang; Chen, Yan; Zhu, Zhaohua; Cao, Yuelong			Associations between weather conditions and osteoarthritis pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis	ANNALS OF MEDICINE			English	Review						Weather conditions; osteoarthritis pain; systematic review; meta-analysis	JOINT PAIN; TEMPERATURE; ARTHRITIS; CHANNELS; RECEPTOR; HIP	Background Although there is an assertion that weather conditions affect osteoarthritis (OA) pain, the results from clinical studies remain inconsistent. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the association between weather conditions and OA pain. Methods Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched from inception to September 30, 2022. Observational studies that explored all weather conditions associated with pain intensity were included. In the systematic review, the methodological quality of the selected studies was assessed and a best-evidence synthesis was used to make qualitative conclusions. Based on homogeneous results, Fisher's Z scores derived from the effect size of temperature (T), barometric pressure (BP) or relative humidity (RH) related to OA pain were synthesized and further transformed to the correlation coefficients (summary r) in meta-analysis. Results A total of 14 studies were included in the best-evidence synthesis of a qualitative systematic review. There was strong evidence with 13 of 14 studies reporting consistent findings that weather factors in general, including any kind of meteorological condition, were associated with OA pain. Subsequently, 3 studies regarding BP or T, and 5 studies regarding RH with the pain of OA were included in quantitative meta-analyses. Both BP (pooled Fisher's Z = 0.37, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.59; summary r = 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.53) and RH (pooled Fisher's Z = 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.18; summary r = 0.086, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.22) were positively related to OA pain, while T was negatively related to OA pain (pooled Fisher's Z = -0.38, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.16; summary r = -0.36, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.16). Conclusions In this study, weather factors in general were significantly associated with OA pain. It may provide useful references for the daily health management of OA. More studies designed with the consistent meteorological condition are warranted to validate the findings. KEY MESSAGE Many people with osteoarthritis think their joint pain is affected by the weather, while the association between OA pain and weather conditions is still unclear. This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 observational studies for the association between weather conditions and OA pain. Weather conditions appear to be associated with OA pain. Barometric pressure and relative humidity were positively correlated to OA pain intensity, while temperature was negatively correlated to OA pain.

However, there is a lack of computational methods that can take into account drivers' adaptation to driving. That is, how behaviour changes with experience. Modelling the effect of driving experience on driver behaviour is important to the development of in-vehicle information technologies, because drivers at different skill levels may need different types or levels of assistance. Cognitive-architecture-based human performance modelling is a valuable method that can integrate different cognitive aspects underlying human behaviour such as skill levels and support quantitative simulation of behaviour. The study reported in this paper tested and examined computational models built in ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) to account for the effect of driving experience on collision avoidance braking behaviour. The modelling results were compared with human data collected from a simulated driving experiment. The models produced braking behavioural results similar to the human results. Moreover, model predictions of three other emergent-braking scenarios were generally similar to and in the same order with the empirical results reported in previous studies. Future research can further integrate the method and results into intelligent driver assistance systems such as collision warning systems to better adjust the systems to the need of different drivers with different skill levels.

Method: We identified six influence techniques from the marketing literature which are thought to be commonly used by sales people. These have been termed the principles of reciprocity, friendship/liking, commitment/consistency, social validation, authority, and scarcity. We examined the use of these techniques by analysing audio-recordings of pharmaceutical representatives' presentations to medical practitioners. Results: Sixteen recordings, detailing 64 medicines, were obtained from seven medical practitioners. Reciprocation was the most commonly observed method of influence. Samples, gifts, printed material, patient information leaflets or invitations were offered in all encounters. Appeals to authority figures, where promotional claims were supported by reference to professors or specialists, specialist groups and specialist hospitals, were recorded. Social validation acts, where reference was made to the peer group were also common. Commitment acts were observed to occur in two ways; the first was as a direct request to use the product detailed and the second was as a series of questions or statements which gradually moved from pre-agreed areas to solicitation of a commitment to prescribe the drug. Conclusion: influence techniques were found to be commonly used by pharmaceutical representatives when they detailed products to medical practitioners. Medical practitioners may not be aware of the potential effect these techniques can have on their prescribing practices. Knowledge of these techniques must be incorporated into educational programmes designed to provide health professionals with critical appraisal skills.

Among these advances is the discovery of the endogenous ligands arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol amide (2-AG), which are selective agonists for the CBI and CB2 receptors, respectively. These endogenous neuromodulators involved in the cannabinergic system are thought to be produced on demand and are metabolized by the enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAG lipase). Recently, we characterized a reuptake system that facilitates the transport of anandamide across the cell membrane and subsequently developed selective inhibitors of this transport, which have been found to have therapeutic potential as analgesic and peripheral vasodilators. The cannabinergic proteins currently being explored, which include the CB1 and CB2 receptors, FAAH and the anandamide transporter, are excellent targets for the development of therapeutically useful drugs for a range of conditions including pain, loss of appetite, immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease and motor disorders. As cannabinoid research has progressed, various potent and selective cannabimimetic ligands, targeting these four cannabinoid proteins, have been designed and synthesized. Many of these ligands serve as important molecular probes, providing structural information regarding the binding sites of the cannabinergic proteins, as well as pharmacological tools, which have been playing pivotal roles in research aimed at understanding the biochemical and physiological aspects of the endocannabinoid system.

J	Pretorius, B; Schoenfeldt, HC				Pretorius, Beulah; Schoenfeldt, Hettie Carina			Opportunities for higher education institutions to develop sustainable food systems in Africa	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						sustainable food systems; higher education; transdisciplinary research; agriculture; partnerships and collaborations		An African Vice-Chancellors' Regional Food Systems Dialogue was hosted with the aim to provide a multi-stakeholder platform for stakeholders to explore various existing and emerging approaches that have the potential to deliver sustainable solutions at scale and encourage collaborative actions to directly transform Africa's agriculture and food systems. Various food system experts and leaders from policy research institutions, universities, and other stakeholders participated. A lack of coherent linkages among stakeholders, youth restlessness, and silos within and between higher education institutions were some of the challenges identified to hindering the much needed transformation. Poor links with ministries and political red tape, inadequate programme funding and capital for coping with rising input costs, as well as unsustainable resource mobilization were also reported as having a negative effect. To address these, stakeholders must embrace collaboration and transdisciplinary practices, mobilize resources, and harness partnerships for greater leverage. In addition, a systems-thinking approach to dealing with complex issues should be adopted, while partners co-design and co-create research initiatives. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Big Data were identified as key enablers that can ensure relevant research with appropriate translation into practice while maintaining quality and excellence. This research-together with society-relevant curriculums with emphasis on agricultural sciences and practical on-farm skills-must inform policies and practice. Higher education institutions must be committed to driving the sustainable food system transformation agenda in partnership with other stakeholders. Institutions must be at the forefront of reimagining the sector's role when it comes to transdisciplinary knowledge co-creation aimed at strengthening the continent's agro-food systems.

A convenience sample of US adults completed an online survey in 2018 (n = 1352 in the analytic sample). We randomly assigned participants to view a: 1) text-only warning without efficacy information (i.e., message intended to increase consumers' confidence in their ability to stop using the product), 2) text-only warning with efficacy information, 3) graphic warning without efficacy information, or 4) graphic warning with efficacy information. Participants viewed their assigned warning on cigarettes, SSBs, and alcohol, in a random order. Across product types, graphic warnings were perceived as more effective than text-only warnings (p < .001) and led to lower believability, greater reactance (i.e., resistance), more thinking about harms, and lower product appeal (all p < .05); policy support did not differ. Compared to SSB and alcohol warnings, cigarette warnings led to higher perceived message effectiveness, believability, fear, thinking about harms, policy support, and greater reductions in product appeal (all p < .05). The efficacy information did not influence any outcomes. Graphic warnings out-performed text-only warnings on key predictors of behavior despite causing more reactance.

J	Dugué, M; Sirost, O; Dosseville, F				Dugue, Manon; Sirost, Olivier; Dosseville, Fabrice			A literature review of emotional intelligence and nursing education	NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE			English	Review						Emotional intelligence; Health; Nursing education; Performances; Social relationships; Training	ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE; CRITICAL THINKING; COPING STYLES; STUDENTS; STRESS; HEALTH; SATISFACTION; LABOR; MANAGEMENT; ABILITY	Aim: The purpose of this study is to investigate the current state of knowledge about emotional intelligence (EI) in nursing education Background: Human relationships and emotions are an integral part of nursing care and contribute to care quality. This part of the profession must be addressed in nursing education to prepare students and deal with their emotions and the patients's. Research on emotional intelligence (EI) in nursing has been particularly developed recently. A broad understanding of many benefits of EI is crucial to include EI in this training program. Design: Systematic literature review Methods: Undertaken using electronic database (Cairn; PubMed; Science Direct; Wiley online library) and specific search terms. This research covered articles published in English and French between 2007 and 2021. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines (PRISMA) directed the systematic review process. Results: 57 articles are included in this systematic review. The literature focuses on EI and nursing education. The findings categorized into four themes: EI and performances; EI and Physical and mental health; EI and Social Relationship; and EI program. Conclusions: This literature review reveals that EI has many benefits in nursing students. Several training programs aimed at developing this concept have proven to be effective in nursing education. We believe that a synthesis of this knowledge will then allow us to better understand the benefits of EI for a further implementation in nursing education. Perspectives and recommendations will also be formulated to enable the implementation of emotional skill development programs in such training.

Ventral pallidum encodes relative reward value earlier and more robustly than nucleus accumbens	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							DISTINCT NEURONAL POPULATIONS; BASAL FOREBRAIN; APPETITIVE BEHAVIORS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; INCENTIVE SALIENCE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEGATIVE CONTRAST; STRIATAL NEURONS; HEDONIC REWARD; MOTOR SYSTEM	The ventral striatopallidal system, a basal ganglia network thought to convert limbic information into behavioral action, includes the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum (VP), typically described as a major output of NAc. Here, to investigate how reward-related information is transformed across this circuit, we measure the activity of neurons in NAc and VP when rats receive two highly palatable but differentially preferred rewards, allowing us to track the reward-specific information contained within the neural activity of each region. In VP, we find a prominent preference-related signal that flexibly reports the relative value of reward outcomes across multiple conditions. This reward-specific firing in VP is present in a greater proportion of the population and arises sooner following reward delivery than in NAc. Our findings establish VP as a preeminent value signaler and challenge the existing model of information flow in the ventral basal ganglia.

We also compared attitudes toward potential harm of side effect disclosure, patients' perceived ability to understand the risk of the side effects, and informed decision-making regarding side effects. MethodsA national survey was performed with 750 patient-caregiver dyads (75.5% participation rate) recruited by 134 oncologists in 13 cancer centers (93% participation rate). Attitudes toward communication of side effects were assessed in terms of drug purpose, severity of potential complications, and probability of harm. ResultsMost patients (82.1-87.0%) and caregivers (75.9-81.5%) thought they should be informed of all possible drug side effects regardless of risk, severity, or drug purpose and wanted these risks to be communicated explicitly. Patients and their caregivers believed that detailed explanations of side effects did not harm patients, and further, they believed that patients could understand risks and make treatment decision based on that information. In contrast, oncologists held less positive attitudes toward providing detailed information about drug side effects, especially if they were not severe and if the drugs were designed for supportive care. ConclusionCancer patients and family members had different perspectives and preferences regarding communication of drug side effects from their oncologists. The data from our study can serve as a guide for oncologists in presenting side effects information to their patients, as well as a basis for physician training.

Fructose Malabsorption and Intolerance: Effects of Fructose with and without Simultaneous Glucose Ingestion	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION			English	Review						fructose; intolerance; malabsorption; high-fructose corn syrup	IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME; CARBOHYDRATE MALABSORPTION; UNITED-STATES; DIETARY FRUCTOSE; YOUNG-CHILDREN; NORMAL ADULTS; BREATH TESTS; FRUIT JUICE; SORBITOL; SYMPTOMS	Concern exists that increasing fructose consumption, particularly in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, is resulting in increasing rates of fructose intolerance and aggravation of clinical symptoms in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome. Most clinical trials designed to test this hypothesis have used pure fructose, a form not commonly found in the food supply, often in quantities and concentrations that exceed typical fructose intake levels. In addition, the amount of fructose provided in tests for malabsorption, which is thought to be a key cause of intolerance, often exceeds the normal physiological absorption capacity for this sugar. To help health professionals accurately identify and treat this condition, this article reviews clinical data related to understanding fructose malabsorption and intolerance (i.e., malabsorption that manifests with symptoms) relative to usual fructose and other carbohydrate intake. Because simultaneous consumption of glucose attenuates fructose malabsorption, information on the fructose and glucose content of foods, beverages, and ingredients representing a variety of food categories is provided.

J	Gupta, S; Watanabe, S; Laurent, SM				Gupta, Suryaa; Watanabe, Shoko; Laurent, Sean M.			Psychological predictors of vaccination intentions among US undergraduates and online panel workers during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INFLUENZA VACCINATION; VALIDATION; HESITANCY; SCIENCE; NURSES	Objective Availability of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 is critical for controlling the pandemic, but herd immunity can only be achieved with high vaccination coverage. The present research examined psychological factors associated with intentions to receive COVID-19 vaccination and whether reluctance towards novel pandemic vaccines are similar to vaccine hesitancy captured by a hypothetical measure used in previous research. Method Study 1 was administered to undergraduate students when COVID-19 was spreading exponentially (February-April 2020). Study 2 was conducted with online panel workers toward the end of the first U.S. wave (July 2020) as a pre-registered replication and extension of Study 1. In both studies, participants (total N = 1,022) rated their willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccination and to vaccinate a hypothetical child for a fictitious disease, and then responded to various psychological measures. Results In both studies, vaccination intentions were positively associated with past flu vaccine uptake, self-reported vaccine knowledge, vaccine confidence, and sense of collective responsibility. Complacency (not perceiving disease as high-risk), anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs, perceived vaccine danger, and mistrust in science/scientists were negative correlates of vaccination intentions. Constraints (psychological barriers), calculation (extensive information-searching), analytical thinking, perceived disease vulnerability, self-other overlap, and conservatism were weakly associated with vaccination intentions but not consistently across both studies or vaccine types. Additionally, similar factors were associated with both real and hypothetical vaccination intentions, suggesting that conclusions from pre-COVID vaccine hesitancy research mostly generalize to the current pandemic situation. Conclusion Encouraging flu vaccine uptake, enhancing confidence in a novel vaccine, and fostering a sense of collective responsibility are particularly important as they uniquely predict COVID-19 vaccination intentions. By including both actual pandemic-related hesitancy measures and hypothetical hesitancy measures from past research in the same study, this work provides key context for the generalizability of earlier non-pandemic research.

TimelyPresent: Connecting families across continents	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article						Media gifts; Asynchronous communication; Family		TimelyPresent is a single purpose information appliance for asynchronous messaging to connect three-generation families whose members need to keep in touch across large distances and in different time zones. The touch screen devices are used in pairs situated in the homes of family members. A user at one end can create a short video clip that is represented as a gift-wrapped present to be sent to the home of another family member. To reinforce the present metaphor the design deliberately confounds common assumptions made about electronic devices in that the present having been sent is no longer accessible to the sender and is delayed so that it arrives at the local time that it was recorded. The paper first describes the process by which this design was derived from the qualitative data in the form of quotes from an open-ended probe study. This process served to preserve the richness of the information in the quotes, while at the same time providing 'requirements' for design. The main part of the paper describes the results from a 2-month, four-family field study of the device. Logs recording the behaviour of users of TimelyPresent, transcripts of 15 interviews, and 133 presents created by the participants were analysed. Analysis of the logs showed that the families needed to preview presents before sending them and repeatedly revisit them after receipt. The analysis of the content of the presents demonstrated the need for the 'forward' and 'backward' facing cameras, now commonly provided in tablets and phones. A forward facing camera is needed because 70% of the presents featured a recording of someone doing something. Other categories of topic were simple "I am thinking of you" messages (15%), "things I've done" (8%), and requests for action (7%). Analysis of the interviews confirmed many of the social needs identified in previous work in this area as well as the value of the present metaphor and its ability to support playful use that enhances subsequent conversations using synchronous media.

Each of these options lead to a similar long-term survival rate, but result in significant differences in appearance, function, cost, recurrence rate, and various other relevant considerations. However, the time available for detailed communication with each patient is often limited in clinics, which puts these women under great psychological stress and can hinder their surgery-related decision making. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a multipurpose surgery decision-making website providing medical information, psychological support, and decision-related simulation for women during breast cancer surgery-related decision making. Methods: Using the 4 steps of action research, which involve multigroup teamwork via regular team meetings, the following were performed: (1) Planning: searching, analyzing, and evaluating health websites to consensually decide the major infrastructure; (2) Action: work was performed simultaneously in 4 groups, which consisted of medical information collection and editing, patient interviews and data extraction, webpage content design, and programming to create or host the website; (3) Evaluation: the website was tested by clinical experts and focus groups of former breast cancer patients to assess its effectiveness and pinpoint appropriate improvements; and (4) Reflection: constant dialogue was conducted between the various participants at each step, which was used as the foundation and motivation of next plan-action-evaluation-reflection circle. Results: Using the action research approach, we completed the construction of our website, which includes the following: (1) "Woman's Voice"-an animated comic depicting the story of a female breast cancer patient with interspersed questions for the users that will help them better empathize with the experience; (2) "Cancer Information Treasure House"-providing breast cancer surgery-related information through text, tables, pictures and a presentation video; (3) "Decision-making Simulator"-helping patients think through and check the pros and cons of the different surgical options via visual-based interactions including "Stairs Climbing" and "Fruit of Hope"; and (4) "Recommended Links"-providing reliable websites for further reference. Additionally, we have further improved the website based on the feedback received from postsurgery breast cancer patients and clinicians. We hope to continue improving to better meet both the patients' and health providers' needs and become a practical decision-making aid for patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. Conclusions: We have created the first breast cancer surgery decision-making assistance tool in Taiwan using a "Web-based" and multifunctional website design. This site aims to provide health care knowledge, psychological healing, and emotional support functions, as well as decision-making capability enhancement simulations. We look forward to assisting breast cancer patients in their decision-making process and expect our website to increase patient's autonomy and improve their communication with clinicians.

In addition, the discovery of novel proteins involved in a critical cellular process provides an opportunity to exploit differences between kinetoplastid and human kinetochore proteins to develop therapeutics for diseases caused by kinetoplastid parasites. Consequently, we identified two of the unconventional kinetochore proteins as key targets (the highly related kinases KKT10 and KKT19). Recombinant T. bruceiKKT19 (TbKKT19) protein was produced, a peptide substrate phosphorylated by TbKKT19 identified (KKLRRTLSVA), Michaelis constants for KKLRRTLSVA and ATP were determined (179 mu M and 102 mu M respectively) and a robust high-throughput compatible biochemical assay developed. This biochemical assay was validated pharmacologically with inhibition by staurosporine and hypothemycin (IC50 values of 288 nM and 65 nM respectively). Surprisingly, a subsequent high-throughput screen of a kinase-relevant compound library (6,624 compounds) yielded few hits (8 hits; final hit rate 0.12%). The low hit rate observed was unusual for a kinase target, particularly when screened against a compound library enriched with kinase hinge binding scaffolds. In an attempt to understand the low hit rate a TbKKT19 homology model, based on human cdc2-like kinase 1 (CLK1), was generated. Analysis of the TbKKT19 sequence and structure revealed no obvious features that could explain the low hit rates. Further work will therefore be necessary to explore this unique kinetochore kinase as well as to assess whether the few hits identified can be developed into tool molecule(s) or new drugs.

J	Chen, Y; Yao, D; Duan, YY				Chen, Yi; Yao, Dong; Duan, Yinying			Complexity of the Analysis of Financial Cloud Based on Fuzzy Theory in the Wisdom of Sustainable Urban Development	COMPLEXITY			English	Article							SERVICES; SYSTEM; GAME	With the rapid growth of our country's economy, fuzzy theory has become more and more widely used in the financial field. This research mainly explores the application of financial cloud based on fuzzy theory in the sustainable development of smart cities. This research will apply the related knowledge of fuzzy theory, combine the traditional information system risk assessment thought and cloud computing system risk assessment, and propose a series of risk assessment models for the cloud computing system. First, design a smart city model to analyze the potential security issues of the financial cloud computing system. The security level model of cloud computing establishes an index system for evaluation objects based on the level of the security model and uses expert evaluation methods to build models for all levels of the risk profile through the analysis-level process and establish a fuzzy relationship model for each evaluation object value. We objectively evaluate the smart city model based on the designed financial cloud platform. Then, specific statistical analysis is performed on the fuzzy relationship model corresponding to the weight value of the evaluation object, the calculation result is finally obtained, and the risk assessment report of the financial cloud computing system is provided. For every 2% increase in trade dependence, the informatization level of smart cities will drop by about 0.03% on average. The findings have long strengthened the overall coordinated development of the financial system, optimized the financial structure, improved development efficiency, promoted close integration of science and technology and finance, and played the role of government leader it was to fulfill. It shows that we need to maximize it and improve the informatization when building smart cities. The level of development is very important for accelerating urban construction.

The design and operation of buildings can be adjusted to be more energy efficient by thinking over the actual distribution of occupants and application scenarios. Nevertheless, accurate, nonintrusive and applicable occupancy positioning systems, especially for complex and densely populated scenarios, have not yet been established. Herein, we propose a novel indoor positioning system based on a red green blue-depth (RGB-D) camera (CIOPS-RGBD). This system utilizes multiple RGB-D cameras to capture colour and depth images from different views. A data fusion algorithm is developed according to the result from a human pose estimation method. Then, the proposed CIOPS-RGBD system was setup and verified within a multifunction room for steady and dynamic accuracy estimation. The accuracy was verified within 10 cm in most cases. Finally, the system was tested under different application scenarios with more than 25 occupants in an 86 m(2) space. The results demonstrate that the system can provide high-quality occupancy positioning and body orientation information for these scenarios in almost real-time, providing a solid basis to improve the actual operation and design of indoor environment creation systems.

TGF-beta signaling plays context-dependent roles in cancer: in pre-malignant cells TGF-beta primarily functions as a tumor suppressor, while in the later stages of cancer TGF-beta signaling promotes invasion and metastasis. Recent studies have also suggested that the cross-talk between TGF-beta signaling and other signaling pathways, such as Hippo, Wnt, EGFR/RAS, and PI3K/AKT pathways, may substantially contribute to our current understanding of TGF-beta signaling and cancer. As a result of the wide-ranging effects of TGF-beta, blockade of TGF-beta and its downstream signaling components provides multiple therapeutic opportunities. Therefore, the outlook for anti-TGF-beta signaling therapy for numerous diseases appears bright and will provide valuable information and thinking on the drug molecular design. In this review, we focus on recent insights into the regulation of TGF-beta signaling in cancer metastasis which may contribute to the development of novel cancer-targeting therapies.

Although most such tests are designed to assess physical fitness, tactical and technical dimensions are also determinants in a full battery of tests. Objectives This systematic review aimed to (a) summarize the criterion validity and reliability of technical and tactical field-based tests applied in soccer and (b) list valid and reliable technical and tactical field-based tests. Methods A systematic review of EBSCO, PubMed, Scielo, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science databases was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The eligibility criteria included (i) population (soccer players from any age group, competitive level, or sex); (ii) exposure (exposure to technical and/or tactical field-based tests covering individual technical skills, tactical behaviours, tactical knowledge, and decision-making in the field); (iii) comparator (a laboratory test and/or a criterion field-based test); (iv) outcome (measures of reliability); and (v) no restrictions concerning study design. The synthesis of results focused on the outcomes considered in the eligibility criteria. Results A total of 5008 titles were identified, of which 21 met the eligibility criteria. Eight studies' analyses centred on tactical tests. Of those, six studies tested the same instrument (FUT-SAT), one study examined divergent thought, and one study used a soccer-specific skills test Among the 10 included studies involving technical tests, only two repeated the same test (the Loughborough Soccer Passing Test). Three studies included tests concurring with physical ones. According to the main findings, the eight studies that used tactical tests revealed that the outcomes obtained from the tests and observers were reliable. The 10 studies that used technical tests, as well as the three concurrent studies, revealed similarly high reliability. Of the eight studies that used tactical tests, seven involved youth participants. Furthermore, three of the 10 studies that conducted technical tests were done on adults. Of the concurrent tests, three involved youth athletes. Only one study including a tactical analysis presented values for validity, while three others provided information about validity. The four studies provided information about test validity. Conclusions Overall, the selected technical and tactical tests, most of which were carried out on youth players, revealed their validity and reliability. Although most studies focused on reliability (which was confirmed regardless of the test included), criterion validity was also observed in the few studies that analysed such factors. Thus, the tests currently proposed for assessing technical and tactical behaviours possess acceptable criterion validity and reliability.

River metrics by the public, for the public	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ECONOMIC VALUE; RESTORATION; PERCEPTIONS; INDICATORS; SERVICES; DEMAND; VALUES; WOOD	Managing rivers in society's best interest requires data on river condition. However, the complexity of river ecosystems, combined with finite budgets for river monitoring and modeling, mean difficult choices are necessary regarding what information will be available. Typically, decisions of "what to measure" are left to natural scientists. However, knowledge of public appetite for different types of information helps ensure river data is useful to society. We investigated public interest in rivers directly, engaging nearly one hundred urban and rural participants in a combination of focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Drawing on concepts of "final" ecosystem services developed in environmental economics, we moved discussions past commonly mentioned stressors, such as pollution, to actual river features important in and of themselves. Participant feedback reflected extensive thought on river issues, in contrast to a stereotype that the public is ambivalent about environmental conditions. Interests were also broad, encompassing water quality and quantity, fish and wildlife, vegetation, and human features. Results show consolidation around relatively few themes despite diverse sociodemographics. Themes were interpreted into distilled, specific metrics to make public feedback as useful as possible for water resources monitoring, modeling, and management. Our research provides detailed, methodically generated hypotheses regarding river themes and metrics of public interest that should be considered as part of the tradeoffs inherent in river monitoring design. Results compared reasonably well to river attributes emphasized in river restoration environmental valuation reviews, with some differences. Future research could test our hypotheses with large-sample surveys.

However, our experience in teaching programming languages has shown that it is an unavoidable difficulty for a programming environment to have a method that enables the system to determine how students think and plan to program. Students often feel perceiving programming subjects as requiring significantly more work than other general courses. Although, novice programmers have their own mental plan to programming, technically they do not have a systematic plan to write a program. In this paper, we, investigated novice programmers' learning performance during programming in a VLB1 programming environment. The system we designed enables students to reach their goal without high cognitive loads and with minimum efforts. The system builds a knowledge tree using a source program written by students and then maintains changes of the source code using a special technique in order to gain students' learning performance. This also helps the system to minimize error messages of the source code, and increases quality of their explanations.

However, limited studies have explored design features that facilitate its use as a pedagogical tool in construction education, particularly in equipping students with experiential skills that are otherwise challenging to obtain due to resource constraints and limited access to construction sites. By evaluating eye tracking, usability questions, and think-aloud protocol data and verbal feedback, this study investigated the usability of a mixed reality environment designed for equipping construction engineering students with competencies for deploying sensing technologies on construction projects. Results revealed features such as accuracy of represented construction activities, quality of animations, and easy access to information and resources as important for designing efficient mixed reality learning environments. While the usability data suggested that the user interface was usable, eye tracking provided profundity on encountered difficulties with the user interface. Through concise outline and sequential design of the user interface, this study revealed that knowledge scaffolding can improve task performance in a mixed reality learning environment. This study adds value to existing literature, in particular by providing insights into the affordances of mixed reality environments that address the technological gap between the construction industry and construction engineering education. The mixed reality learning environment contributes to the cognitive apprenticeship theory through the use of game objects to develop procedural knowledge for addressing construction industry challenges with sensing technologies.

'The Politics of Happiness, a large lecture course designed to introduce students to the diversity of contemporary approaches to advancing human well-being and happiness, overviews the varied thinking and experience of nine polities. Using a 'hybrid, learner-centred delivery model' that relies on an iBook, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, 'The Politics of Happiness' brings cross national comparative political experience to the localised lecture hall, providing contextual information, images, and ideas that transcend students' own national setting and life experience. This on-campus internationalising experience complements the 'Arizona in Yalta' study abroad programme, a 4-week academic experience that permits 1-2 dozen students to intensively engage the Slavic world in Yalta and the Crimea. In juxtaposing these two substantively interconnected initiatives, we argue for the value of an internationalised modern undergraduate curriculum.

It is a repository of rules written in LegalRuleML, an XML formalism designed to be a standard for representing the semantic and logical content of legal documents. The rules represent the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the new Regulation that is significantly affecting the digital market in the European Union and beyond. The DAPRECO knowledge base builds upon the Privacy Ontology (PrOnto) (Palmirani et al in Proceedings of the 7th international conference on electronic government and the information systems perspective: technology-enabled innovation for democracy, government and governance, 2018c), which provides a model for the legal concepts involved in the GDPR, by adding a further layer of constraints in the form of if-then rules, referring either to standard first order logic implications or to deontic statements. If-then rules are formalized in reified Input/Output logic (Robaldo and Sun in J Log Comput 7, 2017) and then codified in LegalRuleML. Reified Input/Output logic is an application of standard Input/Output logic for legal reasoning, in which Input/Output logic is combined with the reification-based approach in Hobbs and Gordon (A formal theory of commonsense psychology, how people think people think. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2017). The DAPRECO knowledge base is then a case study for reified Input/Output logic, and it shows that the formalism indeed appears to be a good candidate to effectively formalize, via uniform and simple (flat) representations, complex linguistic/deontic phenomena that may be found in legal texts. To date, the DAPRECO knowledge base is the biggest knowledge base in LegalRuleML and Input/Output logic freely available online (https://github.com/dapreco/daprecokb/blob/master/gdpr/rioKB_GDPR.xml).

A systematic review of reasons	BMC MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Review						Ethics; Clinical; Decision-making; artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; clinical; Systematic review	PATIENT PREFERENCE PREDICTOR; ALGORITHMIC ETHICS; CARE; CLASSIFICATION; LANDSCAPE; ISSUES	Background Healthcare providers have to make ethically complex clinical decisions which may be a source of stress. Researchers have recently introduced Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based applications to assist in clinical ethical decisionmaking. However, the use of such tools is controversial. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the reasons given in the academic literature for and against their use. Methods PubMed, Web of Science, Philpapers.org and Google Scholar were searched for all relevant publications. The resulting set of publications was title and abstract screened according to defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in 44 papers whose full texts were analysed using the Kuckartz method of qualitative text analysis. Results Artificial Intelligence might increase patient autonomy by improving the accuracy of predictions and allowing patients to receive their preferred treatment. It is thought to increase beneficence by providing reliable information, thereby, supporting surrogate decision-making. Some authors fear that reducing ethical decision-making to statistical correlations may limit autonomy. Others argue that AI may not be able to replicate the process of ethical deliberation because it lacks human characteristics. Concerns have been raised about issues of justice, as AI may replicate existing biases in the decision-making process. Conclusions The prospective benefits of using AI in clinical ethical decision-making are manifold, but its development and use should be undertaken carefully to avoid ethical pitfalls. Several issues that are central to the discussion of Clinical Decision Support Systems, such as justice, explicability or human-machine interaction, have been neglected in the debate on AI for clinical ethics so far.

Because acquisition of the chromatophore was quite a recent event compared with that of the chloroplast ancestor, the Paulinella species are thought to be model organisms for studying the early process of primary endosymbiosis. To obtain insight into how endosymbiotically transferred genes acquire expression competence in the host nucleus, here we analyzed the 5' end sequences of the mRNAs of P. micropora MYN1 strain with the aid of a cap-trapper cDNA library. As a result, we found that mRNAs of 27 genes, including endosymbiotically transferred genes, possessed the common 5' end sequence of 28-33 bases that were posttranscriptionally added by spliced leader (SL) trans-splicing. We also found two subtypes of SL RNA genes encoded by the P. micropora MYN1 genome. Differing from the other SL trans-splicing organisms that usually possess poly(A)-less SL RNAs, this amoeba has polyadenylated SL RNAs. In this study, we characterize the SL trans-splicing of this unique organism and discuss the putative merits of SL trans-splicing in functional gene transfer and genome evolution.

J	Heath, J; Williamson, H; Williams, L; Harcourt, D				Heath, Jennifer; Williamson, Heidi; Williams, Lisa; Harcourt, Diana			Supporting children with burns: Developing a UK parent-focused peer-informed website to support families of burn-injured children	PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING			English	Article						Pediatric burn injury; Parents; Carers; Psycho social support; Online intervention; Website development	QUALITATIVE CONTENT-ANALYSIS; ONLINE HEALTH INFORMATION; FRAMEWORK; SERVICES	Background: Children's burn injuries can have a significant psychosocial impact on parents. However, the stress involved in caring for a child following a burn can often go unrecognized and does not necessarily prompt help seeking by parents. Objective: It is common for adults to seek health-related support and information via the Internet. Many benefit from immediate and easy access to online psychological interventions. A prototype burn-specific, parent-focused, peer-informed, supportive website, designed to provide easy access to information and psychoeducation, was created and tested for acceptability. Patient involvement: Using a partnership-based method of website development, parents and professionals (clinical, academic and support organizations) were recruited and their particular expertise was acknowledged and valued. A participatory action approach was adopted to determine the acceptability of the website for parents/carers. Methods: 31 participants (9 parents, 22 professionals) tested a prototype version of the website. Data was collected using the eHealth Impact Questionnaire and the concurrent think-aloud protocol. Results: Parents and professionals had favorable opinions of the website. Parents' ratings tended to be more favorable than professionals', which was significant for the information and presentation. Participants' thoughts were categorized into seven topics: need, structure/navigation, trust/relevance, language/comprehension, therapeutic content, mode of delivery, and suggested improvements. Discussion: Many practical and psychological barriers can prevent parents of burn-injured children accessing psychosocial support and contribute to a feeling of isolation. Participants felt that the website would be a valuable addition to UK pediatric burn care. The existence of an accessible resource could help to normalize parents' experience of their child's injury and reduce their perceived isolation, although peer interaction is not provided by the website. Practical value: This online resource, hosting information and peers' personal experiences, offers promising and exciting opportunities to empower parents whilst providing accessible supportive advice to encourage self-care and formal/informal support seeking when necessary.

LBP is a symptom associated with biological, psychological and social factors, and serious causes for pain are very rare. Unhelpful beliefs about LBP and inappropriate imaging are common. Practitioners report pressure from patients to provide inappropriate imaging. A recently developed patient education and management booklet, 'Understanding low back pain', was designed to target previously identified barriers for reducing inappropriate imaging. The booklet includes evidence-based information on LBP and supports communication between patients and practitioners. Our aim was to 1) describe the translation process into Finnish and 2) study patients' and practitioners' attitudes to the booklet and to evaluate if it improved patients' understanding of LBP and practitioners' ability to follow imaging guidelines. Methods: We translated the booklet from English to Finnish. Preliminary evaluation of the booklet was obtained from LBP patients (n = 136) and practitioners (n = 32) using web-based questionnaires. Open-ended questions were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Approximately half of the patients reported that reading the booklet helped them to understand LBP, while a third thought it encouraged them to perform physical activity and decreased LBP-related fear. Eighty percent of practitioners reported that the booklet helped them to follow imaging guidelines. In addition, practitioners reported that they found the booklet helpful and that it decreased the need for imaging. Conclusions: The booklet seemed to be helpful in LBP management and in decreasing the need for LBP imaging according to patients and practitioners. Further research on the clinical effectiveness of the booklet in controlled study settings is needed.

J	Heynderickx, D				Heynderickx, D			Radiation belt modelling in the framework of space weather effects and forecasting	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS			English	Article						space weather; radiation belts; forecasting	PROTON FLUENCE MODEL; ELECTRONS	(v) over tilde The Earth's trapped radiation belts were discovered at the beginning of the space age and were immediately recognised as a considerable hazard to space missions. Consequently, considerable effort was invested in building models of the trapped proton and electron populations, culminating in the NASA AP-8 and AE-8 models which have been de facto standards since the 1970s. The CRRES mission has demonstrated that the trapped radiation environment is much more complex than the static environment described by the old models. Spatial and especially temporal variations were shown to be much more important than previously thought, and to require more complex models than those in use at that time. Such models are now becoming available, but they are as yet limited in spatial and temporal coverage. It is vital to coordinate future modelling efforts in order to develop new standard models. The lack of standardisation of radiation belt models complicates their use in engineering applications where particle fluxes are needed as input to radiation effects models. ESA's Space ENVironment Information System (SPENVIS) provides standardised access to models of the hazardous space environment, including but not limited to radiation effects, through a user-friendly World Wide Web interface. The interface includes parameter input with extensive defaulting, definition of user environments, streamlined production of results (both in graphical and textual form), background information, and on-line help. The system can be accessed at the WWW site http://www.spenvis.oma.be/spenvis/. SPENVIS Is designed to help spacecraft engineers perform rapid analyses of environmental problems and, with extensive documentation and tutorial information, allows engineers with relatively little familiarity to produce reliable results. It has been developed in response to the increasing pressure for rapid-response tools for system engineering, especially in low-cost commercial and educational programmes.

J	Saito, S; Mukohara, K; Miyata, Y				Saito, Sayaka; Mukohara, Kei; Miyata, Yasushi			Chronological Changes in Japanese Physicians' Attitude and Behavior Concerning Relationships with Pharmaceutical Representatives: A Qualitative Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CONFLICTS-OF-INTEREST; MEDICAL SPECIALISTS; SELF-REGULATION; NATIONAL-SURVEY; DRUG COMPANIES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; INDUSTRY; GIFTS; RESIDENTS; PROFESSIONALISM	Background: Recent qualitative studies indicated that physicians interact with pharmaceutical representatives depending on the relative weight of the benefits to the risks and are also influenced by a variety of experiences and circumstances. However, these studies do not provide enough information about if, when, how and why their attitudes and behaviors change over time. Methods and Findings: A qualitative study using semi-structured face-to-face individual interviews was conducted on 9 Japanese physicians who attended a symposium on conflicts of interest held in Tokyo. Interviews were designed to explore chronological changes in individual physicians' attitude and behavior concerning relationships with pharmaceutical representatives and factors affecting such changes. Their early interaction with pharmaceutical representatives was passive as physicians were not explicitly aware of the meaning of such interaction. They began to think on their own about how to interact with pharmaceutical representatives as they progressed in their careers. Their attitude toward pharmaceutical representatives changed over time. Factors affecting attitudinal change included work environment (local regulations and job position), role models, views of patients and the public, acquisition of skills in information seeking and evidence-based medicine, and learning about the concepts of professionalism and conflict of interest. However, the change in attitude was not necessarily followed by behavioral change, apparently due to rationalization and conformity to social norms. Conclusions: Physicians' attitudes toward relationships with pharmaceutical representatives changed over time and factors affecting such changes were various. Paying attention to these factors and creating new social norms may be both necessary to produce change in behavior consistent with change in attitude.

In this work, a quenching rapidly strategy was used to synthesize Mo-modified Co3O4 nanosheet arrays as advanced catalysts. The resulting Mo-Co3O4 electrodes showed superior activity and reaction kinetics, with an overpotential of only 341 mV to drive a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 69.0 mV dec(-1). This improved performance is thought to be due to the formation of high-valence Co sites, which creates a synergistic effect. The ability to regulate the synthesis without causing obvious agglomeration and nucleation growth during annealing makes this method a promising approach for the design of other advanced functional materials.

J	Beman, JM; Francis, CA				Beman, J. Michael; Francis, Christopher A.			Diversity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria in the sediments of a hypernutrified subtropical estuary: Bahia del Tobari, Mexico	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							CRENARCHAEOTA; WATER; GENES; POPULATIONS; INTEGRATION; ABUNDANCE; REDUCTASE; SALINITY; PATTERNS; GRADIENT	Nitrification within estuarine sediments plays an important role in the nitrogen cycle, both at the global scale and in individual estuaries. Although bacteria were once thought to be solely responsible for catalyzing the first and rate-limiting step of this process, several recent studies have suggested that mesophilic Crenarchaeota are capable of performing ammonia oxidation. Here we examine the diversity (richness and community composition) of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) within sediments of Bahia del Tobari, a hypernutrified estuary receiving substantial amounts of ammonium in agricultural runoff. Using PCR primers designed to specifically target the archaeal ammonia monooxygenase a-subunit (amoA) gene, we found AOA to be present at five sampling sites within this estuary and at two sampling time points (January and October 2004). In contrast, the bacterial amoA gene was PCR amplifiable from only 40% of samples. Bacterial amoA libraries were dominated by a few widely distributed Nitrosomonas-like sequence types, whereas AOA diversity showed significant variation in both richness and community composition. AOA communities nevertheless exhibited consistent spatial structuring, with two distinct end member assemblages recovered from the interior and the mouths of the estuary and a mixed assemblage from an intermediate site. These findings represent the first detailed examination of archaeal amoA diversity in estuarine sediments and demonstrate that diverse communities of Crenarchaeota capable of ammonia oxidation are present within estuaries, where they may be actively involved in nitrification.

However, it remains controversial how the taste and odour properties of chewing gum influence stress. The present study was designed to investigate this issue in human subjects. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we tested salivary cortisol concentration, which is thought to be a stress marker, in 96 adults who chewed gum with different combinations of taste and odour. Subjects could discriminate between the types of gum without prior information. Salivary cortisol concentrations were highest and lowest for the subjects who chewed the most flavourful gum and the least flavourful gum, respectively. These findings suggest that the salivary cortisol level during gum chewing is not a marker of negative emotions (i.e., stressful conditions) as traditionally considered but, rather, an index of positive emotions that can facilitate biological responses to overcome stressful conditions.

J	Costa, E; Soares, AL; de Sousa, JP				Costa, Eric; Soares, Antonio Lucas; de Sousa, Jorge Pinho			Institutional networks for supporting the internationalisation of SMEs: the case of industrial business associations	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING			English	Article						Small-to medium-sized enterprises; International business; Business associations; Industrial business associations; Institutional networks; Internationalisation networks	INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; FIRMS; PERSPECTIVE; MANAGEMENT; PROMOTION; KNOWLEDGE; MODES	Purpose - This paper aims to study and explore the activities and the use of institutional network resources by industrial business associations (IBAs) to support and facilitate internationalisation processes of small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Other goals are to understand the internationalisation follow-up process and the future vision of IBAs to improve this internationalisation support. Design/methodology/approach - Based on empirical evidence and following an abductive approach, this paper presents a qualitative exploratory field research, providing insights from interviews performed with 20 IBAs based in Portugal. Findings - The findings suggest that the current institutional network support to internationalisation is mainly provided through promotional activities; counselling, training and technical and legal support; information sharing; and cooperation with other institutional entities. Each support category is explored and explained and a new conceptual model is developed to represent these findings. Regarding the internationalisation follow-up, IBAs provide a continuous support for the international operations by using some instruments and mechanisms to assist SMEs after an internationalisation initiative. Finally, collaboration and the use of new information technology are the main aspects to improve IBAs' support in a near future. Research limitations/implications - The qualitative methodological approach adopted in this work can imply a larger difficulty to obtain a generalisation of the findings. Another limitation is that the participating IBAs are based in only one country. Practical implications - Findings can help SMEs to understand the functioning and the benefits of using the institutional network resources of IBAs in overcoming their lack of resources to operate in international markets. IBAs can also understand their current position in terms of internationalisation support and think about new ways for improving this support. Originality/value - This paper contributes to a better understanding of the influence of institutional networks in SME internationalisation by exploring the specific role of one of the institutional actors rather than focusing on the institutional network as a whole. Therefore, this study details the current activities and uncovers other types of support provided by IBAs that are not based on export promotion programmes. New knowledge is also obtained about the specific information content, information sources and means and channels of information sharing used by IBAs for supporting SME internationalisation.

Dianoetic virtues and the hard problem of context	ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Responsible AI; Aristotle; Virtue; Phronesis; Moral responsibility; Virtue ethics	MORAL RESPONSIBILITY; ETHICS; AGENTS; ROBOTS; BUSINESS	During the last decade there has been burgeoning research concerning the ways in which we should think of and apply the concept of responsibility for Artificial Intelligence. Despite this conceptual richness, there is still a lack of consensus regarding what Responsible AI entails on both conceptual and practical levels. The aim of this paper is to connect the ethical dimension of responsibility in Responsible AI with Aristotelian virtue ethics, where notions of context and dianoetic virtues play a grounding role for the concept of moral responsibility. The paper starts by highlighting the important difficulties in assigning responsibility to either technologies themselves or to their developers. Top-down and bottom-up approaches to moral responsibility are then contrasted, as we explore how they could inform debates about Responsible AI. We highlight the limits of the former ethical approaches and build the case for classical Aristotelian virtue ethics. We show that two building blocks of Aristotle's ethics, dianoetic virtues and the context of actions, although largely ignored in the literature, can shed light on how we could think of moral responsibility for both AI and humans. We end by exploring the practical implications of this particular understanding of moral responsibility along the triadic dimensions of ethics by design, ethics in design and ethics for designers.

J	MICKLEBOROUGH, NC; WAREHAM, DG				MICKLEBOROUGH, NC; WAREHAM, DG			TEACHING ENGINEERING TO INCREASE MOTIVATION	JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL ISSUES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE			English	Article								Mathematics and physics receive the greatest attention during the early years of the engineering curriculum. This, unfortunately. does not breed the confidence necessary for engineering students to solve real-world problems, and can lead to a gradual erosion of the motivation necessary to complete the engineering degree. Motivation in students can be increased by introducing design in the formative stages of the engineering program. Selected design problems should have an unstructured component that compels the students to search for information and obtain an increased awareness of the relationship of engineering to other fields of knowledge. Design problems should be closely linked to laboratory experiments that have been carefully chosen to give students a balanced perception of the significance and meaning of the simplifications inherent in mathematical treatments of engineering systems. Students capable of grasping a broad picture of engineering (in the context of working on laboratory projects) accrue many important benefits. These include an appreciation of the nature and limitations of engineering as well as an increased knowledge of how to think as an engineer. The by-products of this are burgeoning confidence and continued motivation to develop the skills to be a good engineer.

J	Woodham, LA; Ellaway, RH; Round, J; Vaughan, S; Poulton, T; Zary, N				Woodham, Luke A.; Ellaway, Rachel H.; Round, Jonathan; Vaughan, Sophie; Poulton, Terry; Zary, Nabil			Medical Student and Tutor Perceptions of Video Versus Text in an Interactive Online Virtual Patient for Problem-Based Learning: A Pilot Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						problem-based learning; educational technology; multimedia; Internet; audiovisual aids	GROUNDED THEORY; EDUCATION; SIMULATION; FIDELITY; DESIGN; PAPER	Background: The impact of the use of video resources in primarily paper-based problem-based learning (PBL) settings has been widely explored. Although it can provide many benefits, the use of video can also hamper the critical thinking of learners in contexts where learners are developing clinical reasoning. However, the use of video has not been explored in the context of interactive virtual patients for PBL. Objective: A pilot study was conducted to explore how undergraduate medical students interpreted and evaluated information from video-and text-based materials presented in the context of a branched interactive online virtual patient designed for PBL. The goal was to inform the development and use of virtual patients for PBL and to inform future research in this area. Methods: An existing virtual patient for PBL was adapted for use in video and provided as an intervention to students in the transition year of the undergraduate medicine course at St George's, University of London. Survey instruments were used to capture student and PBL tutor experiences and perceptions of the intervention, and a formative review meeting was run with PBL tutors. Descriptive statistics were generated for the structured responses and a thematic analysis was used to identify emergent themes in the unstructured responses. Results: Analysis of student responses (n=119) and tutor comments (n=18) yielded 8 distinct themes relating to the perceived educational efficacy of information presented in video and text formats in a PBL context. Although some students found some characteristics of the videos beneficial, when asked to express a preference for video or text the majority of those that responded to the question (65%, 65/100) expressed a preference for text. Student responses indicated that the use of video slowed the pace of PBL and impeded students' ability to review and critically appraise the presented information. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that text was perceived to be a better source of information than video in virtual patients for PBL. More specifically, the use of video was perceived as beneficial for providing details, visual information, and context where text was unable to do so. However, learner acceptance of text was higher in the context of PBL, particularly when targeting clinical reasoning skills. This pilot study has provided the foundation for further research into the effectiveness of different virtual patient designs for PBL.

J	Zhang, P; Gao, H; Zhang, J; Song, DW				Zhang, Peng; Gao, Hui; Zhang, Jing; Song, Dawei			Quantum-Inspired Neural Language Representation, Matching and Understanding	FOUNDATIONS AND TRENDS IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Article							INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; RENORMALIZATION-GROUP; NETWORK	The introduction of Quantum Theory (QT) provides a unified mathematical framework for Information Retrieval (IR). Compared with the classical IR framework, the quantum-inspired IR framework is based on user-centered modeling methods to model non-classical cognitive phenomena in human relevance judgment in the IR process. With the increase of data and computing resources, neural IR methods have been applied to the text matching and understanding task of IR. Neural networks have a strong learning ability of effective representation and generalization of matching patterns from raw data. However, these methods show some unavoidable defects, such as the inability to model user cognitive phenomena, large number of model parameters and the "black box" characteristics of network structure. These problems greatly limit the development of neural IR and related fields. Although the quantum-inspired retrieval framework can theoretically solve the above problems, it is faced with problems such as poor model efficiency and difficulty in integrating with neural network, which lead to a huge gap between QT and neural network modeling. This review gives a systematic introduction to quantum-inspired neural IR, including quantum-inspired neural language representation, matching and understanding. This is not only helpful to non-classical phenomena modeling in IR but also to break the theoretical bottleneck of neural networks and design more transparent neural IR models. We introduce the language representation method based on QT and the quantum-inspired text matching and decision making model under neural network, which shows its theoretical advantages in document ranking, relevance matching, multimodal IR, and can be integrated with neural networks to jointly promote the development of IR. The latest progress of quantum language understanding is introduced and further topics on QT and language modeling provide readers with more materials for thinking.

J	Zhang, XY; Guo, DD; Xu, WH				Zhang, Xiaoyan; Guo, Doudou; Xu, Weihua			Two-way Concept-Cognitive Learning with Multi-source Fuzzy Context	COGNITIVE COMPUTATION			English	Article						Concept-cognitive learning; Two-way learning; Granular computing; Multi-source fuzzy context; Formal concept analysis	MODEL	Concepts learning is the most fundamental unit in the process of human cognition in philosophy. Granularity is one of the fundamental concepts of human cognition. The combination of granular computing and concept learning is critical in the cognitive process. Meanwhile, efficiently and accurately using the information collected from different sources is the focus of data mining in the contemporary. Hence, how to sufficiently learn concepts under a multi-sources context is an essential concern in the field of cognition. This paper offers a new thought for two-way concept-cognitive learning based on granular computing in multi-source fuzzy decision tables. Firstly, based on the best possible guarantee of the classification ability, original information from different sources is fused by conditional entropy, which is the kind of multi-source fusion method (i.e., CE-fusion). Secondly, we learn concepts from a given object set, attribute set, or pair of object and attribute sets in the fused information table, and these three types of concept learning algorithms are designed. This analysis shows that two-way concept learning based on multi-source information fusion is a suitable method of multi-source concept learning. Some examples are valuable for applying these theories to deal with practical issues. Our work will provide a convenient novel tool for researching concept-cognitive learning methods with multi-source fuzzy context.

Digital Competence of university students with disabilities and factors that determine it. A descriptive, inferential and multivariate study	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Digital Competence; Disability; Higher education; Educational technology; Linear regression	ICT; EDUCATION; TECHNOLOGY; FRAMEWORK; TEACHERS; COMMUNICATION; LITERACY; SKILLS	Taking into account that 15% of the world population suffers from some type of disability, few investigations have been concerned with knowing the level of Digital Competence that students with functional diversity have. This research is based on an initial sample of 17,301 newly enrolled university students from the Andres Bello University (Chile), of which 650 are selected for having some type of disability. Its main objective is to know the level of self-perception in the Digital Competence of university students with disabilities and the variables that explain it. To do this, an evaluation instrument consisting of 6 dimensions (technological literacy, information search and processing, critical thinking, problem solving and decision making, communication and collaboration, digital citizenship, and communication and collaboration) is designed and applied. To calculate the validity of the instrument, the partial least squares (PLS) method is applied through structural equation modeling. Next, data is provided regarding the level of Digital Competence of the students and if there are differences between the types of disability. Finally, the data is subjected to a logistic regression to estimate the relationship between the dependent variable (Digital Competence) and a set of independent variables (sociodemographic variables). The results reveal that the instrument used shows high levels of reliability, which guarantees its use in students with disabilities. Likewise, the average level of Digital Competence is medium low. The factors that affect this variable are discussed and the necessary structuring of digital literacy plans is highlighted. Finally, this paper discusses new techniques for diagnosing students' digital skills.

Previous research shows that preschoolers understand metaphors, but less is known about whether preschoolers can learn from metaphors. The current preregistered experiment investigated whether adults (n = 64) and 3- and 4-year-olds (n = 128) can use metaphors to make new inferences. In a between-subjects design, participants heard information about novel artifacts, conveyed through either only positive metaphors (e.g., "Daxes are suns") or positive and negative metaphors (e.g., "Daxes are suns. Daxes are not clouds."). In both conditions, participants of all ages successfully formed metaphor-consistent inferences about abstract, functional features of the artifacts (e.g., that daxes light up rather than let out water). Moreover, participants frequently provided explanations appealing to the metaphors when justifying their responses. Consequently, metaphors may be a powerful learning mechanism from early childhood onward.

However, mounting evidence shows that these "silent" variations can have a significant impact on protein expression and function and should no longer be considered "silent". Here, the effects of six synonymous and six non-synonymous variations, previously found in the gene of ADAMTS13, the von Willebrand Factor (VWF) cleaving hemostatic protease, have been investigated using a variety of approaches. The ADAMTS13 mRNA and protein expression levels, as well as the conformation and activity of the variants have been compared to that of wild-type ADAMTS13. Interestingly, not only the non-synonymous variants but also the synonymous variants have been found to change the protein expression levels, conformation and function. Bioinformatic analysis of ADAMTS13 mRNA structure, amino acid conservation and codon usage allowed us to establish correlations between mRNA stability, RSCU, and intracellular protein expression. This study demonstrates that variants and more specifically, synonymous variants can have a substantial and definite effect on ADAMTS13 function and that bioinformatic analysis may allow development of predictive tools to identify variants that will have significant effects on the encoded protein.

HEALTH PROMOTION JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA			English	Article						anxiety; depression; fathers; mothers; perinatal; support	MENTAL-HEALTH PROBLEMS; POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION; PERINATAL DEPRESSION; PARTNER SUPPORT; SOCIAL SUPPORT; MATERNAL DEPRESSION; SYMPTOMS; ANXIETY; EXPERIENCE; PERIOD	Issue Addressed: Up to one in five new mothers experience depression or anxiety, and their partners are often the first line of social and practical support. However, many fathers are unprepared for their role as support person. The SMS4dads program (www.sms4dads.com) provides text-based support to new fathers but lacks specific messages addressing maternal mental distress.Methods: A mixed methods process engaged mothers with lived experience of perinatal mental distress to identify message content for co-designing texts in SMS4dads. Participants completed surveys derived from research literature and parenting web sites using the theoretical framework of support domains: emotional or affectionate support, informational support, tangible support and positive social interaction. Mothers also indicated the most appropriate timing of support: at the point of identifying the distress (emerging), with ongoing symptoms (persistent) or during recovery (easing). Free text comments from mothers were linked to survey topics to provide examples of wording suitable for text messages to fathers.Results: Fifty-five mothers with lived experience completed the surveys. All support items were more often endorsed as helpful rather than not helpful by mothers. Emotional support was thought helpful in the early stages, tangible support was valued with ongoing symptoms and social interaction appreciated as symptoms eased.Conclusions: Mothers experiencing perinatal depression and anxiety require a range of supportive actions by their partners, including household tasks and baby-care, encouragement, listening and managing relationships with family and friends.So What?: Information provided by distressed mothers can provide guidance to professionals when designing information for fathers/partners. Digital delivery of this co-designed information to fathers across urban and rural areas may enhance the competence of fathers working to support mothers experiencing mental distress in the perinatal period.

Limited resources will be in ever greater demand and the environmental stress from prolonged droughts, record-breaking heat waves, and destructive floods will increase. Existing long-term trends and behaviors will not be sustainable. That is our current trajectory, but we can still change course. Significant advances in information communication technologies and big data, combined with new frameworks for thinking about urban places as social-ecological-technical systems, and an increasing movement towards transdisciplinary scholarship and practice sets the foundation and framework for a metropolitan observatory. Yet, more is required than an infrastructure for data. Making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable will require that data become actionable knowledge that change policy and practice. Research and development of urban sustainability and resilience knowledge is burgeoning, yet the uptake to policy has been slow. An integrative and holistic approach is necessary to develop effective sustainability science that synthesizes different sources of knowledge, relevant disciplines, multi-sectoral alliances, and connections to policy-makers and the public. To address these challenges and opportunities, we developed a conceptual framework for a metropolitan observatory to generate standardized long-term, large-scale datasets about social, ecological, and technical dimensions of metropolitan systems. We apply this conceptual model in Texas, known as the Texas Metro Observatory, to advance strategic research and decision-making at the intersection of urbanization and climate change. The Texas Metro Observatory project is part of Planet Texas 2050, a University of Texas Austin grand challenge initiative.	[Bixler, R.

Some of the harvesting and processing operations of these materials can be performed with stone tools that leave traces on the tools. It is therefore possible to get information about the nature of the harvested and processed plants, the technical operations carried out with the tools and the design of the tools themselves. This information has a technological, economic and cultural scope, and is essential for thinking about the links between environmental changes and lithic industry variability. We present here the first data from technological and use-wear studies carried out on collections from Epipalaeolithic sites in Algeria and Tunisia, focusing on unretouched blades and bladelets from the Columnatian, blades and backed blades from the Typical Capsian, and notched blades and bladelets from the Upper Capsian.

The limits of fire suppression-centred strategies have become evident even in technologically well-equipped countries, due to high-cost and a legacy of landscape transformations, yet with ultimately low-efficient solutions vis`a-vis extreme fires. Many practitioners and policymakers thus increasingly recognize the need to develop novel, integrated fire management approaches that shift emphasis towards the root causes of extreme fires. Here we provide from the socioeconomic angle a collective, science-informed vision about to what extent landscapes and people could become more fire-resilient through integrated fire prevention strategies. Based on our insights from around the globe, we highlight the need for interdisciplinary approaches, multiple stakeholder perspectives, and systems thinking, so as to break down a wicked problem with complex linkages into manageable nodes of information. We illustrate this, using Mediterranean forests as an example. New fire regimes will predictably make our societies more exposed and vulnerable to the risk of extreme wildfires. Proactive, innovative strategies are thus needed to provide adaptive and cost-efficient policy responses, whether based on direct changes in landscape and fuel-load management, or indirect changes in rural development models.

Decisions at the end of life: an empirical study on the involvement, legal understanding and ethical views of preregistration house officers	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article							TERMINALLY-ILL PATIENTS; DISCUSS RESUSCITATION; DOCTORS	Objectives: To collect information on the involvement, legal understanding and ethical views of preregistration house officers (PRHO) regarding end-of-life decision making in clinical practice. Design: Structured telephone interviews. Participants: 104 PRHO who responded. Main outcome measures: Information on the frequency and quality of involvement of PRHO in end-of-life decision making, their legal understanding and ethical views on do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order and withdrawal of treatment. Results: Most PRHO participated in team discussions on the withdrawal of treatment (n = 95, 91.3%) or a DNR order (n = 99, 95.2%). Of them, 46 (44.2%) participants had themselves discussed the DNR order with patients. In all, it was agreed by 84 (80.8%) respondents that it would be unethical to make a DNR order on any patient who is competent without consulting her or him. With one exception, it was indicated by the participants that patients who are competent may refuse tube feeding (n = 103, 99.0%) and 101 (97.1%) participants thought that patients may refuse intravenous nutrition. The withdrawal of artificial ventilation in incompetent patients with serious and permanent brain damage was considered to be morally appropriate by 95 (91.3%) and 97 (93.3%) thought so about the withdrawal of antibiotics. The withdrawal of intravenous hydration was considered by 67 (64.4%) to be morally appropriate in this case. Conclusions: PRHO are often involved with end-of-life decision making. The results on ethical and legal understanding about the limitations of treatment may be interpreted as a positive outcome of the extensive undergraduate teaching on this subject. Future empirical studies, by a qualitative method, may provide valuable information about the arguments underlying the ethical views of doctors on the limitations of different types of medical treatment.

J	Alberti, S; Motta, P; Ferri, P; Bonetti, L				Alberti, Sara; Motta, Paolo; Ferri, Paola; Bonetti, Loris			The effectiveness of team-based learning in nursing education: A systematic review	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Review						Team based learning; Education, nursing; Academic success; Learning outcomes; Systematic review	PERFORMANCE; STUDENTS	Aim: Team-Based Learning (TBL) is an active teaching methodology, recently implemented also in the field of nursing education. The main objective of this study was to identify, appraise and summarize primary studies on the effectiveness of TBL in achieving learning outcomes in undergraduate nursing students. The secondary objective was to explore the generic competencies the students developed, and their reactions and attitudes. Study design: A systematic review of experimental and quasi-experimental studies. Databases sources: Cochrane Library, Pubmed/Medline, Cinahl, PsycINFO, and Eric; Google Scholar was used to search for grey literature and the reference lists of the retrieved papers. Review methods: A research protocol was developed according to the PRISMA-P guidelines. Two reviewers conducted the selection process. The "JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist" was used to check the quality of the selected studies. Results: We included 12 studies: 2 monocentric randomized controlled trials and 10 quasi-experimental studies. Nine out of 12 studies produced significant results in favour of TBL in terms of academic performance and skills development, however results were divergent when TBL was compared with other teaching methods. The results of 7 studies highlighted the effectiveness of TBL in improving the development of communication skills, inter professional learning, and self-directed learning. Divergent results were obtained with regard to problem solving and critical thinking skills. TBL promoted classroom engagement, however it did not seem to be associated with better learning outcomes. Conclusions: Overall, TBL was found to be effective in achieving undergraduate nursing students' learning outcomes, but evidence was not sufficiently strong to warrant that it is more effective than other teaching methods. The results of this review are in favour of the implementation of TBL in nursing education, however studies with more rigorous methods and with a mixed method design are required to improve the transferability of results.

J	Xiao, YB; Zhou, B; He, D; Liu, JZ				Xiao, Yabin; Zhou, Bin; He, Dan; Liu, Jingzhong			Auxiliary Teaching System of Higher Mathematics Based on Random Matrix Model	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							TECHNOLOGY; EDUCATION	With the development of computer technology, computers have become a part of people's lives and the Internet has connected the world's networks as a whole. Computer technology is changing people's study, life, and work. People's traditional education mode, thinking, content, method, and talent training program have a significant impact. The development from traditional to computer technology-based teaching methods has brought new developments and leaps in educational technology. This paper analyzes the research background, significance, and research status of the advanced mathematics auxiliary teaching system, introduces the related technologies and development modes used in the development of the system, and especially discusses the access database technology by ADO and the mathematical expression based on MathML language. Secondly, starting from the actual teaching, we analyze the functional requirements and performance requirements of the system in detail and make detailed planning and design for the system architecture, database selection, functional modules, etc. The design and implementation process of this teaching system are summarized. The teaching strategy inference engine is the key to the personalization and intelligence of the ICAI system. According to the learning models provided by different students, the system designs a corresponding teaching sequence for the learners by controlling the meta-knowledge of the domain knowledge base. The teaching strategy inference engine cuts the domain knowledge tree, selects the knowledge points suitable for the student, and sorts the selected knowledge points reasonably to generate an optimal teaching sequence. According to the students' learning situation, combined with the teaching rules in the teaching rule library, the students' grades are dynamically adjusted, so as to select new learning content for students and provide teaching suggestions in time. The student model is the premise of the ICAI system to achieve individualization and intelligence. The system makes a comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis of students through fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and fuzzy reasoning. On this basis, a cognitive student model is established, which is the teaching strategy that provided the basis for the formulation.

Glutamate and dopamine are neurotransmitters that regulate thinking and impulse signals independently or synergistically. However, emulation of such simultaneous neurotransmission is still challenging. Here we report design and fabrication of synaptic transistor that emulates multiplexed neurochemical transmission of glutamate and dopamine. The device can perform glutamate-induced long-term potentiation, dopamine-induced short-term potentiation, or co-release-induced depression under particular stimulus patterns. More importantly, a balanced ternary system that uses our ambipolar synaptic device backtrack input 'true', 'false' and 'unknown' logic signals; this process is more similar to the information processing in human brains than a traditional binary neural network. This work provides new insight for neuromorphic systems to establish new principles to reproduce the complexity of a mammalian central nervous system from simple basic units.

Then, launch the stone at the same speed, and move according to the sweeping conditions (perpendicular to the axis of motion, along the axis of motion) of male and female elite curlers. The aim is to provide sports science information required for curling athletes by analyzing the distance of the stone, the change in the speed of a moved stone, the change in broom acceleration, and athletes' muscle activity. The results of experiments conducted on four male and four elite female curlers are as follows. Under gender, the stone's movement distance was long after the sweeping of male athletes, and the speed of the stone was not different according to the conditions. The broom's acceleration did not show a difference in both the sweeping condition and the athlete's gender condition, and the muscle activity did not show a significant difference in both the sweeping condition and the gender condition. In summary, it is thought that male athletes moved the stone farther by raising the ice surface temperature by vertical load than female athletes. Also, there was no statistically significant difference in muscle activity results, but it was found that there was a specific pattern of muscle activity in the pushing and pulling motions during the sweeping of male and female athletes. It is expected to be used as primary data.

J	Guo, Y; Zhang, SB; Ritter, A; Man, H				Guo, Yi; Zhang, Shubo; Ritter, Arthur; Man, Hong			A Case Study on a Capsule Robot in the Gastrointestinal Tract to Teach Robot Programming and Navigation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION			English	Article						Behavior-based robot programming; gastrointestinal tract; robot navigation; robot simulation; robotics; Webots; wireless capsule endoscopy	FABRICATION; DESIGN	Despite the increasing importance of robotics, there is a significant challenge involved in teaching this to undergraduate students in biomedical engineering (BME) and other related disciplines in which robotics techniques could be readily applied. This paper addresses this challenge through the development and pilot testing of a bio-microrobotics case study that can be integrated into curricula in BME, electrical and computer engineering (ECE), and other disciplines. This case study is based on the existing technology of wireless capsule endoscopy and centered on a "grand challenge" of building a capsule robot to navigate the human gastrointestinal tract to detect abnormality or to destroy malignant tissues. First, a conceptual design example for building such a capsule robot is presented, followed by a laboratory module that demonstrates robot navigation techniques using Webots simulation. The case study introduces robotic technologies, including robot building components, operating modes, and behavior-based programming, and students experience robot simulation in the laboratory module. The case study developed was pilot tested in three BME and ECE courses at the authors' institution. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the case study in enhancing students' understanding of robotics, interdisciplinary skills, and critical thinking. The case study is shown to support challenge-based learning, which promotes adaptive expertise through rapid knowledge building and innovation.

Hence, we aimed to assess the treatment-related resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) changes in the brain regions associated with future thinking and the associations between rsFC changes and clinical improvements. Thirty-eight adult patients with MDD were randomly assigned with equal likelihood to receive 16-week individual CBT or talking control with a 12-month follow-up period. We evaluated the rsFC changes in the frontal regions, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and limbic structures key to the depression pathophysiology and future thinking with 2 x 2 mixed ANOVA interaction analysis. Pearson's correlation analysis with Bonferroni's correction was also performed to examine the associations with clinical symptoms, such as depression severity and automatic thoughts in follow-up evaluations. Treatment-specific changes include enhancement in frontopolar connectivity with the nucleus accumbens. An increased rsFC was associated with lower negative automatic thoughts postoperatively, together with lower depressive symptoms and higher positive automatic thoughts at follow-up. Conclusively, rsFC changes in the fronto-limbic neural control circuit after CBT, particularly between the frontal pole and nucleus accumbens, may be clinically meaningful functional changes related to the depression recovery process.

J	Oleskiw, TD; Pasupathy, A; Bair, W				Oleskiw, Timothy D.; Pasupathy, Anitha; Bair, Wyeth			Spectral receptive fields do not explain tuning for boundary curvature in V4	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						shape processing; object recognition; ventral visual pathway; macaque monkey; computational model	AREA V4; SHAPE REPRESENTATION; CARTESIAN GRATINGS; MACAQUE; SELECTIVITY; CORTEX; CELLS; ORGANIZATION; RESPONSES; FEATURES	The midlevel visual cortical area V4 in the primate is thought to be critical for the neural representation of visual shape. Several studies agree that V4 neurons respond to contour features, e.g., convexities and concavities along a shape boundary, that are more complex than the oriented segments encoded by neurons in the primary visual cortex. Here we compare two distinct approaches to modeling V4 shape selectivity: one based on a spectral receptive field (SRF) map in the orientation and spatial frequency domain and the other based on a map in an object-centered angular position and contour curvature space. We test the ability of these two characterizations to account for the responses of V4 neurons to a set of parametrically designed two-dimensional shapes recorded previously in the awake macaque. We report two lines of evidence suggesting that the SRF model does not capture the contour sensitivity of V4 neurons. First, the SRF model discards spatial phase information, which is inconsistent with the neuronal data. Second, the amount of variance explained by the SRF model was significantly less than that explained by the contour curvature model. Notably, cells best fit by the curvature model were poorly fit by the SRF model, the latter being appropriate for a subset of V4 neurons that appear to be orientation tuned. These limitations of the SRF model suggest that a full understanding of midlevel shape representation requires more complicated models that preserve phase information and perhaps deal with object segmentation.

Like Mother, Like Daughter: Adults' Judgments About Genetic Inheritance	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-APPLIED			English	Article						folk biology; genetic inheritance; variability; familiarity; intuitive theories	CHILDRENS; NAIVE; UNDERSTANDINGS; ESSENTIALISM; RESEMBLANCE; CURRICULUM; BELIEFS; SCHOOL	Do adults think about genetic inheritance as a deterministic or probabilistic process? Do adults display systematic biases when reasoning about genetic inheritance? Knowing how adults think about genetic inheritance is valuable, both for understanding the developmental end point of these concepts and for identifying biases that persist even after formal education. In two studies, we examined adults' reasoning about genetic inheritance for familiar animals (Study 1) and unfamiliar animals (Study 2). First, participants were presented with animals that varied in eye color and were asked to judge whether each could be the offspring of a particular set of animal parents that had either the same or different eye colors. The potential offspring had eye colors that were either identical to the parents, blended the parents' eye colors, or differed from the parents. Next, participants predicted how six offspring of the animal parents would look. Participants judged a variety of choices as possible-not only the ones resembling the parents-suggesting that they thought genetic inheritance was a probabilistic process. Additionally, many participants thought that female offspring would look more like their mothers and male offspring would look more like their fathers. Thus, systemic biases in reasoning about inheritance persist into adulthood. Public Significance Statement We studied adults' thinking about biology and found that they had some correct knowledge (such as understanding that offspring can look different from their parents), but also some misunderstandings (such as believing that offspring will resemble the parent of the same sex). This information can be used to tailor secondary and undergraduate genetics instruction to build on the knowledge students already have while correcting the misunderstandings they might hold.

The major purpose of this study is to evaluate the significance of integrating PBL and CL. The course creates capacities and abilities in critical thinking, problem-solving, independent learning, collaboration, and specialized technical information. Since PBL alone does not guarantee profoundly talented cooperation, it was supplemented with CL. This structure coordinated course substance and understudy pragmatic accomplishment in a reenacted learning environment. The understudies built a line following and Bluetooth-controlled robots by actualizing control programming on the "Arduino" open-source platform, just as utilizing remote interchanges as Arduino offers an instinctive advancement condition and different equipment and programming resources that permit quick improvement of microcontroller-based ventures. The basic findings of this study work reveal that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL when integrated with CL. The research successfully extends onto another group of learners for preparing similar gadgets under different timelines. In addition, this paper also discusses upon the problem identification, selection of the equipment, circuit design, hardware mounting, and critical analysis of the results acquired from the course through the personal learning experience of the teachers as well as in the form of feedback from the two groups of young learners.

J	Pu, JZ; Liu, ZX				Pu, Jiaozi; Liu, Zongxin			Cloud Improvement Model of Niche Width and Its Application in Tram Evaluation	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article								Niche theory is one of the most important theories and tools in ecology. Niche width is a concept used to measure the position and role of an individual or population in a biological community. However, in the measurement of niche width, due to the unique characteristics of ecosystems, evaluators often give information based on subjective judgment to describe the status of ecological factors. Natural language is used to describe the state of ecological factors, and all the observed values come from the subjective judgment of the language value of the evaluator and have fuzziness and randomness at the same time. To achieve scientific and reasonable decision evaluation, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the fuzziness and randomness of complex systems. The cloud model is used to improve the niche width model, aimed at solving ecological factors under natural language information assignment and niche width evaluation. It is applied to measure tram niche width, which is the typical ecological factor value assignment using natural language thinking.

Physical Education Teachers' Perceptions of a Motor Competence Assessment Digital App	JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						motor development; pediatrics; digital education; inertial measurement units	FUNDAMENTAL MOVEMENT SKILLS; CHILDREN; USABILITY; ADOLESCENTS; INTERVENTIONS; OUTCOMES	Purpose: To refine a motor competence assessment app prototype, enabling its redesign. Method: Workshops were conducted to inform the prototype development. App's usability was evaluated on its ability to communicate relevant information to the teachers (n=9). A "think out loud" protocol was applied by the users. Results: Both workshops refined the app, namely: interface, background, acceptability/feasibility, results, teachers themselves, and effectiveness. Competitor analysis revealed recommendations for the wireframe, visuals, and proposed skills to be assessed. The need to include a demonstration for first -time users, video guidance, and links to more information for each skill was also raised. There was a recommendation on the design brief features and experiences. Conclusions: This study will provide guidance in discovering how digital solutions may shape motor competence assessment. The usability testing process with the teachers provides insight on the essential/desirable features required on these apps, enabling the prototype's redesign to meet the users' needs.

J	Huang, JL; Lai, XJ				Huang JiaLin; Lai XueJia			What is the effective key length for a block cipher: an attack on every practical block cipher	SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						block cipher; effective key bits; meet-in-the-middle; brute-force attack		Recently, several important block ciphers are considered to be broken by the brute-force-like crypt-analysis, with a time complexity faster than the exhaustive key search by going over the entire key space but performing less than a full encryption for each possible key. Motivated by this observation, we describe a meet-in-the-middle attack that can always be successfully mounted against any practical block ciphers with success probability one. The data complexity of this attack is the smallest according to the unicity distance. The time complexity can be written as 2(k)(1 - epsilon), where epsilon > 0 for all practical block ciphers. Previously, the security bound that is commonly accepted is the length k of the given master key. From our result we point out that actually this k-bit security is always overestimated and can never be reached because of the inevitable loss of the key bits. No amount of clever design can prevent it, but increments of the number of rounds can reduce this key loss as much as possible. We give more insight into the problem of the upper bound of effective key bits in block ciphers, and show a more accurate bound. A suggestion about the relationship between the key size and block size is given. That is, when the number of rounds is fixed, it is better to take a key size equal to the block size. Also, effective key bits of many well-known block ciphers are calculated and analyzed, which also confirms their lower security margins than thought before. The results in this article motivate us to reconsider the real complexity that a valid attack should compare to.

J	Skalka, J; Drlik, M				Skalka, Jan; Drlik, Martin			Automated Assessment and Microlearning Units as Predictors of At-Risk Students and Students' Outcomes in the Introductory Programming Courses	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						introductory programming courses; dropout prediction; automated assessment; source code evaluation; microlearning	TOOLS	The number of students who decided to study information technology related study programs is continually increasing. Introductory programming courses represent the most crucial milestone in information technology education and often reflect students' ability to think abstractly and systematically, solve problems, and design their solutions. Even though many students who attend universities have already completed some introductory courses of programming, there is still a large group of students with limited programming skills. This drawback often increases during the first term, and it is often the main reason why students leave study too early. There is a myriad of technologies and tools which can be involved in the programming course to increase students' chances of mastering programming. The introductory programming courses used in this study has been gradually extended over the four academic years with the automated source code assessment of students' programming assignments followed by the implementation of a set of suitably designed microlearning units. The final four datasets were analysed to confirm the suitability of automated assessment and microlearning units as predictors of at-risk students and students' outcomes in the introductory programming courses. The research results proved the significant contribution of automated code assessment in students' learning outcomes in the elementary topics of learning programming. Simultaneously, it proved a moderate to strong dependence between the students' activity and achievement in the activities and final students' outcomes.

Is disorganization a feature of schizophrenia or a modifying influence: Evidence of covariation of perceptual and cognitive organization in a non-patient sample	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Perceptual organization; Disorganization; Schizophrenia; Psychopathology; Perception; Cognition; Behavior	VISUAL INTEGRATION; SYMPTOM DIMENSIONS; THOUGHT-DISORDER; SIZE PERCEPTION; MOOD DISORDERS; NERVOUS TYPES; SCHIZOTYPY; MODEL; PSYCHOSIS; DEFICITS	A subgroup of people with schizophrenia is characterized by reduced organization in perception, thought, language, and motor functioning, and these impairments covary significantly. While this may reflect multiple expressions of an illness-related core processing impairment, it may also represent the extreme end of an organization-disorganization dimension that is found throughout the general population. In this view, disorganization is a modifying influence on illness expression. To obtain preliminary information on this hypothesis, we examined covariation of perceptual and cognitive organization in a non-patient sample. Subjects completed a battery of perceptual tasks with demonstrated sensitivity to schizophrenia and disorganization, and a battery of questionnaires examining cognitive organization. Our results indicated that level of perceptual organization ability, across multiple tasks, was associated with self-reported levels of cognitive organization on multiple measures. This is thus preliminary evidence for a common process affecting perceptual and cognitive organization in the general population, suggesting that disorganization may reflect a modifying influence mechanism, instead of an illness-related process, in schizophrenia.

These studies provided valuable information showing that oligodendroglial AMPARs may be involved in the modulation of proliferation, differentiation, and migration of oligodendroglial progenitors, as well as survival of myelinating oligodendrocytes during physiological conditions in vivo. They also suggested that targeting the subunit composition of AMPARs may be an important strategy for treating diseases. However, at the same time, the experimental findings taken together still do not provide a clear picture on the topic. Hence, new ideas and new experimental designs are required for understanding the functional role of AMPARs in the oligodendrocyte lineage cells in vivo. It is also necessary to consider more closely the temporal and spatial aspects of AMPAR-mediated signalling in the oligodendrocyte lineage cells. These two important aspects are routinely discussed by neuronal physiologists studying glutamatergic synaptic transmission, but are rarely debated and thought about by researchers studying glial cells.

Methods: we undertook amixed-method evaluation, informed by the realist approach, of different approaches to loneliness in one health and social care system in the East Midlands, UK. We used a combination of documentary analysis, interviews/focus groups with service providers and users and quantitative analysis to develop an initial programme theory. Results: common aims of local interventions included enhancing social connectivity, providing emotional support and advice/information; recurring interventions included social activities, emotional support, advice and information, lunch clubs, learning new skills and practical support. None were robustly evaluated. Fifty-six service user or providers were involved in interviews or focus groups, which highlighted the causes of loneliness, preferred services, access to services, thoughts about intervention configuration and desired outcomes from services. The themes emerging from the interviews/focus groups from both service provider and service user perspectives were combined with all of the previous emerging data to create an overarching programme theory. Statements were constructed to allow service providers to think about which interventions might be useful to achieve specific outcomes in different contexts. Conclusion: the causes and consequences of loneliness vary widely between individuals, so a personalised approach is required to identify the causes and potential solutions. This study provides some high-level principles that can help commissioners and providers to tailor interventions to the individual needs of service users.

Different from the existing deep learning based UWA OFDM receivers, the proposed receiver combines deep learning with the classical expert knowledge of block-based signal processing in UWA OFDM to improve system performance and interpretability. It performs joint channel estimation and signal detection by designing skip connection (SC) convolutional neural network (CNN) cascaded attention mechanism (AM) enhanced bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network, abbreviated as SC-CNN-AM-BiLSTM network (SCABNet). Specifically, the channel estimation subnet is designed with SC-CNN to utilize the thought of image super-resolution to reconstruct the entire channel frequency response of all subcarriers. The signal detection subnet is designed with AM-BiLSTM to extract the correlations of received sequential data for signal detection. Especially with the AM, the signal detection subnet can focus more on effective information of the received distorted signal to train the optimal network weights to improve the accuracy of data recovery. The proposed SCABNet is evaluated by experimental data, and the results have demonstrated that the SCABNet has the lowest BER and robust performance compared to the traditional linear algorithm, deep learning based black-box receiver, and ComNet receiver. And the proposed SCABNet is effective and robust when multiple nonideal factors co-exist. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To enable educational technology researchers and school teachers to thoroughly know the research foci and applications of concept maps in technology-supported learning environments for K-12 education (CM-K12), the present study conducted a systematic review of studies published in seven SSCI (Social Science Citation Index) journals of educational technology by referring to the technology-based learning model. The review results showed that concept maps mostly played the role of a personal Mindtool and a collaborative Mindtool, and were mainly applied in elementary schools. The majority of elementary school teachers employed concept maps as a collaborative Mindtool (for a learning group), a personal Mindtool (for individual students), and a learning design tool. As for secondary school teachers, concept maps were mostly adopted as an assessment and evaluation tool, personal Mindtools, and collaborative Mindtools. In terms of application issues, the most adopted medium was desk-top computers, and the most adopted application domains were science, engineering, and language. The research focus explored the most in CM-K12 research was cognition, followed by affect and learning behavior. Based on the findings, several recommendations are proposed.

Background: Many first-year nursing students struggle to understand central concepts in A & P. Concept car-toons-cartoon characters proposing scientifically acceptable statements and misconceptions combined with an illustration-might facilitate active learning in lectures, overcome misconceptions and promote deep learning. Voting on the most precise statement using a student response system gives formative information about the students' conceptual understanding. Design: Parallel mixed methods design with an emphasis on a qualitative approach. Methods: Nine concept cartoons were developed based on former students' written answers to exam items and applied in lectures at three universities/university colleges. Qualitative data of students' experiences were collected in three focus group interviews during November 2019, one focus group at each of the three univer-sities/university colleges (n = 5, 8 and 8). A short questionnaire was also applied (n = 343) to all students at the three universities/university colleges. Qualitative data were analysed using qualitative content analyses, whereas frequency analysis and Chi-square statistics were applied for the quantitative data. The study was approved by the Norwegian Centre for Research Data, ref. 779586. Results: Qualitative data analysis indicated that the use of concept cartoons addresses different learning styles and could promote deep learning and enhance the environment for learning. The concept cartoons were also seen as valuable for examination preparation. Regarding potential improvements, more information about concept cartoons, how they were developed and how they were supposed to be used would be beneficial, and the car-toons could be used in a more time-efficient manner during lectures. Quantitative data indicated that most of the students thought that concept cartoons were useful and inspiring in learning A & P, and they would recommend further use to increase their understanding of central concepts. There were no significant differences across sex, age, or entrance qualifications when it comes to the benefits of using concept cartoons in learning A & P. Compared to students born in Scandinavia, a larger proportion of students born outside Scandinavia found the use of concept cartoons inspiring for their learning in A & P. Conclusions: The use of concept cartoons was appreciated by the students to develop a conceptual understanding in A & P. Most students recommended future use. Registration number: At point of submission put this on title page Tweetable abstract: Concept cartoons are appreciated as an active learning strategy and formative assessment in developing nursing students' conceptual understanding of anatomy and physiology.

A stochastic mathematical model of 4D tumour spheroids with real-time fluorescent cell cycle labelling	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE			English	Article						cancer; melanoma; individual-based model; FUCCI; population dynamics	SOLID TUMOR; GROWTH; PROLIFERATION; DYNAMICS; INVASION; HYPOXIA	In vitro tumour spheroids have been used to study avascular tumour growth and drug design for over 50 years. Tumour spheroids exhibit heterogeneity within the growing population that is thought to be related to spatial and temporal differences in nutrient availability. The recent development of real-time fluorescent cell cycle imaging allows us to identify the position and cell cycle status of individual cells within the growing spheroid, giving rise to the notion of a four-dimensional (4D) tumour spheroid. We develop the first stochastic individual-based model (IBM) of a 4D tumour spheroid and show that IBM simulation data compares well with experimental data using a primary human melanoma cell line. The IBM provides quantitative information about nutrient availability within the spheroid, which is important because it is difficult to measure these data experimentally.

The underlying mechanisms that cause stereotypic portrayals of gifted adolescents are not well known. We aimed to investigate behavioral performance of gifted adolescents during social decision-making tasks to assess their affective and social/non-social cognitive abilities. We examined cooperation behaviors of 22 gifted and 26 average adolescents during an iterative binary public goods (PG) game, a multi-player social interaction game, and analyzed strategic decision processes that include cooperation and free-riding. We found that the gifted adolescents were more cooperative than average adolescents. Particularly, comparing the strategies for the PG game between the two groups, gifted adolescents were less sensitive to loss, yet were more sensitive to gain. Additionally, the behavioral characteristics of average adolescents, such as low trust of the group and herding behavior, were not found in gifted adolescents. These results imply that gifted adolescents have a high cognitive ability but a low ability to process affective information or to adapt in social groups compared with average adolescents. We conclude that gain/loss sensitivity and the ability to adapt in social groups develop to different degrees in average and gifted adolescents.

There is increasing evidence for the possibility of prevention, particularly by attaining and maintaining normal weight and adequate levels of physical exercise. No prior studies have reported awareness of risk and prevention in this high-risk group. Aim: To explore beliefs about personal risk of diabetes and prevention in people with a parent with type II diabetes Design of study: A total of 254 adults with type II diabetes were identified from five randomly selected practices in south London. Self-report questionnaires were sent to 152 eligible offspring of these patients. A total of 105 of the offspring returned the self-report questionnaires and participated in the study. Setting: Five randomly selected practices in south London. Methods: Patients with type II diabetes in five randomly selected practices in south London were asked if we might contact their offspring. One randomly selected offspring (over 18 years of age) from each family completed a self-report questionnaire. Results: Of 254 adults with type II diabetes 152 had eligible offspring. A total of 105 (69%) of the offspring participated in the study. A total of 69 (66%) of these offspring believed their personal risk of developing diabetes was 'low'. At least 28 (28%) and maybe as many as 73 (70%) underestimated the risk of diabetes in offspring. Compared with the number thinking their current risk was low significantly more (95 versus 69) thought that their risk would be low if neither of their parents had diabetes. Fifty-seven (54%) thought prevention was possible. Sixteen thought taking more exercise was important for prevention and only seven thought that weight control was important. Many had good general knowledge about diabetes and its complications but awareness of the relationship between diabetes and cardiovascular disease was poor. Conclusions: People with a parent with type II diabetes are usually aware that they have an increased risk of diabetes. However, they often underestimate that risk and know little about potentially useful preventive strategies. They need accurate information about these matters if they are to reduce their risk of diabetes and its complications.

Design and Methods The data were collected with the questionnaire form: "Individual Information Form" and "Views and Appllications on Palliative Care," created by the researchers in line with the literature. Findings A total of 96.6% of the nurses evaluated the scope of palliative care as pain relief, and the most common difficulties in care were identified as bad news (88.1%). In all, 22.0% of the nurses talked to the patient and their family about death. Practice Implications It is thought that the majority of nurses are not trained in palliative care and their opinions about palliative care are affected by this situation.

Sources of errors in high-throughput screening can be classified as logistic, measurement-related, or strategic. Biological assays formatted for high throughput are generally susceptible to small but systematic errors arising from a variety of sources, and the correction of such errors often requires the application of advanced data analysis methods. For virtual screening, chemical space design and molecular similarity analysis play crucial roles and similarity-based methods also have principal limitations, as discussed herein. In addition, the relative performance of computational screening methods, regardless of their specific features, generally displays strong compound class dependence. However, given their opportunities and limitations, experimental and computational screening can be carried out in a highly complementary manner and integrated screening strategies are thought to have significant potential in pharmaceutical research.

Developments in DNA nanotechnologies have transformed our thinking about the applications of nucleic acids. Progress from designed assemblies to functional outputs will continue to benefit from functionalities added to the nucleic acids that can participate in reactions or interactions beyond hybridiation. In that respect, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are interesting because they combine the hybridization properties of DNA with the modularity of peptides. In fact, PNAs form more stable duplexes with DNA or RNA than the corresponding natural homoduplexes. The high stability achieved with shorter oligomers (an 8-mer is sufficient for a stable duplex at room temperature) typically results in very high sequence fidelity in the hybridization with negligible impact of the ionic strength of the buffer due to the lack of electrostatic repulsion between the duplex strands. The simple peptidic backbone of PNA has been shown to be tolerant of modifications with substitutions that further enhance the duplex stability while providing opportunities for functionalization. Moreover, the metabolic stability of PNAs facilitates their integration into systems that interface with biology. Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in using PNAs as biosupramolecular tags to program assemblies and reactions. A series of robust templated reactions have been developed with functionalized PNA. These reactions can be used to translate DNA templates into functional polymers of unprecedented complexity, fluorescent outputs, or bioactive small molecules. Furthermore, cellular nucleic acids (mRNA or miRNA) have been harnessed to promote assemblies and reactions in live cells. The tolerance of PNA synthesis also lends itself to the encoding of small molecules that can be further assembled on the basis of their nucleic acid sequences. It is now well-established that hybridization-based assemblies displaying two or more ligands can interact synergistically with a target biomolecule. These assemblies have now been shown to be functional in vivo. Similarly, PNA-tagged macromolecules have been used to prepare bioactive assemblies and three-dimensional nanostructures. Several technologies based on DNA-templated synthesis of sequence-defined polymers or DNA-templated display of ligands have been shown to be compatible with reiterative cycles of selection/amplification starting with large libraries of DNA templates, bringing the power of in vitro evolution to synthetic molecules and offering the possibility of exploring uncharted molecular diversity space with unprecedented scope and speed.

How to use Information Technology (IT) to better serve people's healthcare is one of the most featured emerging directions in the academic circle. An important field of Healthcare 4.0 research is the reliability engineering of healthcare service. Because healthcare systems often affect the health and even life of their users, developers must be very cautious in the design, development, and operation of these healthcare systems and services. The problems to be solved include the reliability of business process, system functions, and personal healthcare data. The Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) has been applied in reliability engineering for safety-critical systems in available studies, using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. However, the method has not been applied in the field of digital healthcare services development. Therefore, to narrow the gap, we present in this paper a semi-quantitative functional resonance analysis method to develop reliable healthcare services for diabetics. Moreover, this paper has tried to improve the reliability design of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) of traditional insulin pump therapy by system thinking.

Extant research has separately examined the impact of participant numbers and the impact of platform transparency, but there is a lack of research on the interaction between the two. However, testing the joint effect of the two sources of information can provide a more comprehensive understanding of individuals' co-creation behaviour. This paper aims to fill the gap and further reveal the psychological mechanism behind the behaviour. Design/methodology/approachThree experimental studies were conducted to test the hypotheses. FindingsThe results show that a large number of participants will stimulate and inhibit creative performances on untransparent and transparent co-creation platforms, respectively. Moreover, this study found that the effect of the number of participants on creative performance is mediated by arousal on untransparent platforms and by the constraint on idea expression on transparent platforms. Research limitations/implicationsThis study advances knowledge of how the number of participants in an activity and platform transparency jointly influence prosumers' creative performance and the corresponding mechanism. However, the main limitation of the study is that the findings are from scenario-based experiments. Practical implicationsThis study provides a more comprehensive understanding of prosumers' creative performance under the influence of the number of activity participants and platform transparency. The findings can help co-creation sponsoring companies and co-creation platforms improve activity performance by designing better information disclosure strategies, thereby enhancing platform value. Originality/valueThe findings enrich the literature on platform ecosystem and co-creation by integrating previously separate knowledge on the effects of participant numbers and platform transparency. In addition, the findings deepen the overall understanding of prosumers' behaviour.

We aimed to investigate thought processes of candidates answering multiple-choice questions, considering possible reasons for differential attainment between IMGs and UK graduates. Design We employed a semistructured qualitative design using cognitive interviews. Systematic grounded theory was used to analyse data from ` think aloud' interviews of general practitioner specialty trainees (GPSTs) while answering up to 15 live questions from the UK Membership of the Royal College of General Practitioners Applied Knowledge Test (AKT). Setting East Midlands, UK. Participants 21 GPSTs including 13IMGs and 8 UKtrained doctors. Outcomes Perceptions of participants on how they answered AKT questions together with strategies used or difficulties experienced. Results We interviewed 21 GPSTs (8 female, 13 male, 13 IMGs, 14 from black and minority ethnic groups, age 24-64 years) in years 1-3 of training between January and April 2017. Four themes were identified. ` Theoretical versus real-life clinical experience': participants reported difficulties recalling information and responding to questions from theoretical learning compared with clinical exposure; rote learning helped some IMGs recall rare disease patterns. Recency, frequency, opportunity and relevance: participants reported greater difficulty answering questions not recently studied, less frequently encountered or perceived as less relevant. Competence versus insight: some participants were over optimistic about their performance despite answering incorrectly. Cultural barriers: for IMGs included differences in undergraduate experience, lack of familiarity with UK guidelines and language barriers which overlapped with the other themes. Conclusions The difficulties we identified in candidates when answering AKT questions may be addressed through training. IMGs face additional difficulties which impede examination success due to differences in educational experience, content familiarity and language, which are also potentially amenable to additional training support.

This research requires access to large genetic datasets to maximize the likelihood of identifying previously unknown, close ge-netic connections. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies, such as 23andMe, Inc., manage by far the largest and most diverse genetic databases that can be used for this purpose. It is therefore important to think carefully about guidelines for carrying out collab-orations between researchers and such companies. Such collaborations require consideration of ethical issues, including policies for sharing ancient DNA datasets, and ensuring reproducibility of research findings when access to privately controlled genetic datasets is limited. At the same time, they introduce unique possibilities for returning results to the research participants whose data are analyzed, including those who are identified as close genetic relatives of historical individuals, thereby enabling ancient DNA research to contribute to the restoration of information about ancestral connections that were lost over time, which can be particularly meaningful for families and groups where such history has not been well documented. We explore these issues by describing our experience designing and carrying out a study searching for genetic connections between 18th-and 19th-century enslaved and free African Amer-icans who labored at Catoctin Furnace, Maryland, and 23andMe research participants. We share our experience in the hope of helping future researchers navigate similar ethical considerations, recognizing that our perspective is part of a larger conversation about best ethical practices.

J	Lenert, LA; Ding, W; Jacobs, J				Lenert, Leslie A.; Ding, Wei; Jacobs, Jeff			Informatics for public health and health system collaboration: Applications for the control of the current COVID-19 pandemic and the next one	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						public health informatics; population health; national patient identifier; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource; electronic clinical quality measure		Public health faces unprecedented challenges in its efforts to control COVID-19 through a national vaccination campaign. Addressing these challenges will require fundamental changes to public health data systems. For example, of the core data systems for immunization campaigns is the immunization information system (IIS); however, IISs were designed for tracking the vaccinated, not finding the patients who are high risk and need to be vaccinated. Health systems have this data in their electronic health records (EHR) systems and often have a greater capacity for outreach. Clearly, a partnership is needed. However, successful collaborations will require public health to change from its historical hierarchical information supply chain model to an ecosystem model with a peer-to-peer exchange with population health providers. Examples of the types of informatics innovations necessary to support such an ecosystem include a national patient identifier, population-level data exchange for immunization data, and computable electronic quality measures. Rather than think of these components individually, a comprehensive approach to rapidly adaptable tools for collaboration is needed.

Measuring these deviations, such as "loss of meaning" and incoherence, is difficult and requires substantial human effort. Computational procedures can be employed to characterize the nature of the anomalies in discourse. We present a set of new tools derived from network theory and information science that may assist in empirical and clinical studies of communication patterns in patients, and provide the foundation for future automatic procedures. First we review information science and complex network approaches to measuring semantic coherence, and then we introduce a representation of discourse that allows for the computation of measures of disorganization. Finally we apply these tools to speech transcriptions from patients and a healthy participant, illustrating the implications and potential of this novel framework. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Such studies describe how the short-term distribution of deaths relates to short-term fluctuations in air pollution levels. The regression-based risk coefficients from these acute-effects studies have been widely used to estimate the excess annual mortality within a population with a specified average level of air pollution. Such calculations are inappropriate. Since daily time-series data provide no simple direct information about the degree of Life-shortening associated with the excess daily deaths (many of which are thought to be due to exacerbation of well-advanced disease, especially cardiovascular disease), such data cannot contribute to the estimation of the effects of air pollution upon chronic disease incidence and long-term death rates. Yet it is that category of effect that is of most pubic health importance. Conclusion Such effects are best estimated from long-term cohort studies that Incorporate good knowledge of local (or personal) exposure to air pollutants and of potential confounders. Time-series studies, properly evaluated, can identify the existence of acute toxic effects of transient peak levels of air pollution; they are thus useful for monitoring acute toxicity and for identifying the most noxious pollutants. However, to quantify the long-term health impacts of air pollution we cannot use acute-effects data.

First is the Neural Blackboard Architecture (NBA), which aims to account for representation and processing of complex and combinatorial conceptual structures in the brain. Second is IDyOT (Information Dynamics of Thinking), which derives sentence-like structures by learning statistical sequential regularities over a suitable corpus. Although IDyOT is designed at a level more abstract than the neural, so it is a model of cognitive function, rather than neural processing, there are strong similarities between the composite structures developed in IDyOT and the NBA. We hypothesize that these similarities form the basis of a combined architecture in which the individual strengths of each architecture are integrated. We outline and discuss the characteristics of this combined architecture, emphasizing the representation and processing of conceptual structures.

The expression of aromatase in breast cancer cells and surrounding stromal cells is up regulated compared to non-cancerous cells. In situ estrogen synthesis is thought to stimulate breast cancer growth in both an autocrine and a paracrine manner. A complex mechanism is involved in the control of human aromatase expression, in that seven promoters have been identified and found to be utilized in a tissue-selective manner. Increased aromatase expression in breast tumors is, in part, attributed to changes in the transcriptional control of aromatase expression. While promoter I.4 is the main promoter that controls aromatase expression in non-cancer breast tissue, promoters II and I.3 are the dominant promoters that drive aromatase expression in breast cancer tissue. During the last several years, our laboratory performed a series of studies to examine the transcription regulatory mechanism of aromatase expression in breast cancer cells. We functionally characterized promoters II and I.3, and carried out DNase 1 footprinting analysis that identified two regulatory elements, S1 and CREaro. Using the yeast one-hybrid approach to screen a human breast tissue hybrid cDNA expression library, we found that four orphan/nuclear receptors, ERRalpha-1, EAR-2, COUP-TFI and RAR-gamma, bind to the S I element, and that CREB1, Snail (SnaH) and Slug proteins bind to the CREaro element. Studies from this and other laboratories have revealed that in cancer tissue versus normal tissue, several positive regulatory proteins (e.g. ERRalpha-1 and CREB1) are present at higher levels and several negative regulatory proteins (e.g. EAR-2, COUP-TFI, RARgamma, Snail and Slug proteins) are present at lower levels. This may explain why the activity of promoters II and I.3 is up regulated in cancer tissue. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aromatase expression between non-cancerous and cancerous breast tissue, at the transcriptional level, may help in the design of a therapy based on the suppression of aromatase expression in breast cancer tissue.

It is thought that, in many cases, reactive metabolites cause toxicity by binding covalently to tissue proteins, However, until recently it was difficult to identify these protein targrts. Due to the development of an immunochemical approach, this problem has been overcome, as is illustrated here by studies that have been conducted on the metabolic basis of the idiosyncratic hepatitis caused by the inhalation anaesthetic halothane. The major problem to solve in the future will be to determine how protein adduct formation leads to toxicity. It is possible that protein adduct formation may alter an important cellular function or may lead to immunopathology, as is thought to occur in the case of halothane hepatitis. If an allergic reaction is suspected, purified protein targets or reactive metabolites can sct?ie as antigens for identifying sensitized individuals, This information can be used to prevent not only an allergic reaction to the drug, but possibly cross-reactions to other drugs that are structurally related. Another important application of these studies is the design of safer alternative drugs that will not produce structurally similar toxic reactive metabolites.

Through analyzing visual attention mechanism and pilling characteristic, a new attention mechanism model is designed to detect pilling information, by which the contrast between pilling and background texture is enhanced in the saliency map constructed. And then, Otsu algorithm is adapted to segment the interesting region from saliency map, and area mean of foreground target is thought as the segmented threshold to separate pilling from interesting region. On this basis, extracting pilling features from the pilling binary images are classified through BP neural network. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional detection methods, the proposed method can evaluate objectively pilling grade effectively, and correct classification rate is over 94%.

OR has made substantial contributions to disaster response and these have been the subject of several recent literature reviews. However, these reviews have also identified research gaps for OR - two of which are (1) limited contribution from soft OR, and (2) a need to model communications during disasters where there are complex interactions between stakeholders. At the intersection of these gaps we apply the Viable System Model (VSM) to examine challenges of rapid communication viability during dynamic disasters. The data that informs this paper were collected in four case studies in Japan - three on its current capabilities (e.g. a local government disaster management office) and one on its response to a past disaster (the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake in 1995). This paper shows how applying VSM identified generic gaps and opportunities for communication systems and shows how these case studies signal the utility of VSM structures to arranging communications for fast-paced and changing environments. This paper also contributes to VSM theory through developing two new concepts (1) environmental support mechanisms for viability; and (2) rapid implementation unit emergence. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The instrument has a two-tier question design, which has led to multiple ways of scoring and interpretation. In this research, a method of pattern analysis was proposed and applied to analyze two-tier item pairs on the subskill of Control-of-Variable (COV) of LCTSR. The data were collected from students in grade 4 through college in both the United States and China. Students' response patterns to two combined item pairs were analyzed and compared against students at different grade levels and reasoning development levels. Six performance levels were established based on students' response patterns, serving as indicators of COV reasoning development levels. With the new method, a relation was obtained between students' level of COV skills and grade level, as well as their level of overall reasoning development. It can provide useful information on the possible developmental levels of students' reasoning skills.

Currently, vital parameters are commonly displayed as trends along a timeline. However, clinical decisions are more often based upon concepts, such as the depth of anesthesia, that are derived by combining parameter relationships and additional context information. The current displays do not visualize such concepts and therefore do not optimally support the decision process. A new display should present an ecological interface (EI). The principle of EI design is to visualize all of the information necessary for decision making in one single display. Methods. In the first approach, we developed an EI that visualizes 35 relevant parameters for anesthesia monitoring. All of the parameters are generated by an anesthesia software simulator. Sixteen anesthetists had to administer two simulated general anesthetics: in one setting working only with the simulator's monitors ("SimOnly"), and in another setting working with the simulator's monitors in combination with the EI ("Combi1"). During each experiment, one unexpected critical incident (either blood loss or a cuff leakage) had to be identified. The control and monitoring behavior was analyzed by recording the subjects' eye movements and think-aloud protocol. With the help of the eye-tracking results, we re-designed the EI. The new EI was then tested with no eye tracking ("Combi2") on eight anesthetists under analogous conditions as in "Combi1." Results. Cuff leakage was identified significantly quicker in "Combi1" (7 of 8 cases; time (T): 65 s +/- 73 s) than in "SimOnly" (6 of 8 cases; T: 222 s +/- 187 s). Blood loss was identified in 5 of 8 cases (T: 215 s +/- 76 s) in "Combi1" as quickly as in "SimOnly" (all cases; T: 217 s +/- 72 s). In "Combi1," the EI was used as the main source of information (in 43 +/- 19% of time) and was frequently favored when identifying an evolving critical incident. In "Combi2," cuff leakage was identified in 7 of 8 cases (T: 70s +/- 111s) as quickly as in "Combi1." Blood loss was identified significantly quicker in all cases (T: 147 s +/- 62 s) in "Combi2" than in "Combi1" and in "SimOnly." Conclusion. The results have shown that appropriately designed EIs may improve the anesthetist's decision making and focus attention on specific problems. Now, the findings have to be tested in future studies by widening the scope using other simulated scenarios and being closer to reality under real conditions in the OR. Eye tracking proved to be a useful method to analyze the anesthetists' decision making and appropriately re-design interfaces.

The method is based on the photo-induced electron transfer between the natural base guanine and the labeled fluorophore. The G:T mispair extension catalyzed by the exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment DNA polymerase (KF exo(-)) was easily detected and the effect of the nearest neighbor base pair on the mispair extension rate was clearly observed. More importantly, kinetics of the G:T, G:A and G:G mispair formation and extension under single turnover conditions were measured by continuous fluorescence-based assay for the first time. The probes also showed their applicability to discriminate the 3' -> 5' proofreading activity of different exonuclease-proficient DNA polymerases. The presented method may greatly simplify the screening and characterization procedures of the increasing number of polymerases that are thought to be potential targets for drug design and cancer treatment. It will also provide important information for deep understanding of the polymerase fidelity mechanism. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Objectives Investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of a virtually-delivered exercise intervention. Setting Home and community. Methods A total of 168 middle-aged (49.6 [12.3] years old) men (57%) and women (43%) who lived an average 15.5 (12.3) years with spinal cord injury (SCI) participated. The 16-week program provides users (a) website access with exercise information, resources, and 16 skill-building modules; (b) virtual 60-minute, group-based weekly meetings; and (c) a starter package of exercise equipment. Primary outcomes included subjective physical activity (IPAQ) and objective exercise (Polar A300 wrist-based activity monitor and H7 heart rate strap). Secondary outcomes included fitness indices during a maximal arm crank test, plus self-reported exercise barriers, exercise self-efficacy, and goal-directed thinking. Results RCT results indicate significant between group differences in participants' self-reported weekly time spent in vigorous-intensity PA and goal directed thinking but not for fitness changes. Data combined for IMM and WLC participants from Polar monitoring show participants performed 150 min per week of aerobic exercise plus reported significantly greater time spent in moderate-PA, vigorous-PA, self-efficacy for exercise and nutrition, goal directed thinking, and exercise barriers. Oxygen uptake (V?O-2 peak) and power output (watts max) were the only physiologic measures to demonstrate significant change, with a moderate effect size. Conclusion This virtually-delivered program offers a promising approach to increase exercise among those with SCI and may help participants perceive fewer motivational barriers and greater self-efficacy.

Learning the Cartesian coordinate system has the potential to promote numerical cognition through number-space associations, as well as core geometric concepts, including isometric transformations, symmetry, and shape perception. Immersive virtual reality (VR) facilitates embodied forms of teaching and learning mathematics through whole-body sensorimotor interaction and offers benefits as a platform to learn the Cartesian coordinate system compared with "real world" classroom activities. Our goal was to validate the Cartesian-Garden, a serious game designed to provide an educationally robust but engaging vehicle to teach these concepts in primary-level mathematics in a multisensory VR environment. In the game, the child explores a Cartesian-Garden, that is, a field of flowers in which each flower corresponds to x and y coordinates. Specifically, we tested whether exploring numbers spatially represented improved spatial and numerical skills independently from the use of VR. Children (n = 49; age 7-11 years old) were divided into experimental and age-matched control groups. The experimental group explored the Cartesian-Garden and picked flowers corresponding to target coordinates; the control group played a VR game unrelated to Cartesian coordinates. To quantify potential improvements, children were tested before and after training with perceptual tests investigating number line and spatial thinking. The results point toward differential age-related improvements depending on the tested concept, especially for the number line. This study provides the guidelines for the successful use of the Cartesian-Garden game, beneficial for specific age groups.	[Cuturi, Luigi F.

However, many challenges remain. In this article, we discuss a novel approach designed to increase the applicability of scenario-based strategizing in top management teams. Drawing on behavioural strategy as a theoretical lens, we design a yardstick to study the impact of scenario-based strategizing. We then describe our approach, which includes developing scenarios and alternative strategies separately and supporting the strategy selection through an integrated assessment of the goal-based efficacy and robustness. To facilitate the collaborative strategizing in teams, we propose a matrix with robustness and efficacy as the two axes, which we call the Parmenides Matrix. We assess the impact of the novel approach by applying it in two cases, at a governmental agency (German Environmental Ministry) and a firm affected by disruptive change (Bosch, leading global supplier of technology and solutions).

Equine Veterinarians' and Health Care Professionals' Concerns Related to the Implementation of the National Equine Identification System	JOURNAL OF EQUINE VETERINARY SCIENCE			English	Article						Equine; Identification; Veterinarian; NAIS; Microchip		The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) is an animal tracking database created to contain the spread of contagious foreign animal diseases. Currently, no studies address the perceived support of the equine veterinary field for NAIS. The objectives of this study were to determine equine veterinarians' level of familiarity with NAIS, perceived effectiveness of NAIS, use of equine microchipping, and extent of disaster planning. A 26-question online survey (Zoomerang zPro, MarketTools, Inc., San Francisco, CA) was designed and administered to a sample (n = 139) drawn from the American Association of Equine Practitioners. SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used to analyze data. Results showed that only 19.4% of practicing veterinarians were "very familiar" with NAIS. Nearly half (49.3%) of the respondents were neutral regarding their opinion of NAIS. However, 55.6% thought that NAIS would efficiently stop the spread of a contagious animal disease. More than 52% reported that they were currently microchipping horses. After microchipping, 66.7% did not verify premises' identification numbers or record information about the horse, and 80.2% did not complete the paperwork to contact the State Department of Agriculture. Approximately 75.2% of respondents reported that they had experienced a contagious disease outbreak. Most (81.6%) veterinarian respondents did not have a plan to deal with clients' horses during a disaster. There is a need for communication and information for veterinarians regarding NAIS, premises registration, emergency planning guidelines, data to collect after microchipping, and how to provide information to clients.

J	Casteel, MA				Casteel, Mark A.			What Do I Know about Severe Weather? The Influence of Weather Knowledge on Protective Action Decisions	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Communications; decision-making; Decision-making; Education; Emergency response; Experimental design; Societal impacts	WARNING COMMUNICATION; RISK PERCEPTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEFICIT MODEL; SCIENCE; UNAWARE; INFORMATION; RESIDENTS; BEHAVIOR; TORNADOES	Research has found that people who know the least about a topic are often very overconfident of their knowl-edge, while those who know the most often underestimate their knowledge. This finding, known as the Dunning-Kruger effect (DKE) has recently been shown to occur in knowledge of severe weather as well. The current study investigated whether being overconfident in one's knowledge might translate into a tendency to make poorer sheltering decisions when faced with severe weather. Participants took two severe weather quizzes, one of perceived knowledge and one of objective knowledge. Participants also predicted their performance on both quizzes. The participants then saw four wireless emergency tornado warning alerts on a simulated smartphone screen, along with a tornado scenario, and then made two protective action decisions: one about immediately sheltering in place and the other the likelihood they would drive away. The results revealed that the participants did exhibit the DKE: those with the lowest levels of knowledge exhibited the most overconfi-dence while those with the highest levels of knowledge underestimated their performance. Also, in comparison with individu-als with the most knowledge, those with the least knowledge were the most likely to state that they would not shelter immediately and that they would get in their car and drive away. Although more education is needed, the findings suggest a conundrum: those who know the least about severe weather, thinking they know a lot, are probably those individuals least likely to seek out additional education on the topic.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Tornadoes are common in many states, and the National Weather Service issues tornado warnings in the hopes that individuals will take protective action. Previous research has found that people with low levels of knowledge (such as knowledge of severe weather) are often overconfident of their knowledge. This study explores whether those with low (as compared with high) severe weather knowledge make poorer decisions to a tornado warning. The findings show that those with the lowest knowledge were indeed overconfident and that they were less likely to shelter and more likely to drive away than those with high knowledge. The findings highlight that more severe weather education, although a worthy goal, might be difficult to implement if knowledge confidence is already high.

During the transition, the contour length increases by up to 70% without complete strand dissociation. Three mechanisms are thought to be involved: force-induced melting into single-stranded DNA where either one or both strands carry the tension, or a B-to-S transition into a longer, still base-paired conformation. We stretch sequence-designed oligonucleotides in an effort to isolate the three processes, focusing on force-induced melting. By introducing site-specific inter-strand cross-links in one or both ends of a 64 bp AT-rich duplex we could repeatedly follow the two melting processes at 5 mM and 1 M monovalent salt. We find that when one end is sealed the AT-rich sequence undergoes peeling exhibiting hysteresis at low and high salt. When both ends are sealed the AT sequence instead undergoes internal melting. Thirdly, the peeling melting is studied in a composite oligonucleotide where the same AT-rich sequence is concatenated to a GC-rich sequence known to undergo a B-to-S transition rather than melting.

The field of human factors traces its origins to the Second World War, but Three Mile Island has been the best example of how groups of people react and make decisions under stress: this nuclear accident was exacerbated by wrong decisions made because the operators were overwhelmed with irrelevant, misleading or incorrect information. Errors and their nature are the same in all human activities. The predisposition for error is so intrinsic to human nature that scientifically it is best considered as inherently biologic. The causes of error in medical care may not be easily generalized. Surgery differs in important ways: most errors occur in the operating room and are technical in nature. Commonly, surgical error has been thought of as the consequence of lack of skill or ability, and is the result of thoughtless actions. Moreover the 'operating theatre' has a unique set of team dynamics: professionals from multiple disciplines are required to work in a closely coordinated fashion. This complex environment provides multiple opportunities for unclear communication, clashing motivations, errors arising not from technical incompetence but from poor interpersonal skills. Surgeons have to work closely with human factors specialists in future studies. By improving processes already in place in many operating rooms, safety will be enhanced and quality increased.

Method The study designed as cross-sectional research was carried out with the participation of 1,061 university students. Data collection tools used were the Personal Information Form, Sexual Myths Scale, and Intercultural Sensitivity Scale. Findings It was determined that the students believed in myths at a moderate level. The students who thought that being together with different cultures did not have a positive contribution were found to believe in sexual myths at a higher level (p < 0.001). It was also determined that intercultural sensitivity was a significant predictor of sexual myths in university students (p < 0.001). Implications for Practice While planning sexual education provided to relay sexual knowledge to societies accurately, cultural differences should be considered.

Based in part on the practices of the Open Source communities of the late 20th and early 21st centuries such as the Linux community, along with the idea that human activity should be held as primary in human Internet interactions, open source educational processes suggest that individuals will require new types of skills and self-efficacies in order to realize the potential of their Internet activities. Education for these skills is at least in part dependent on development of curricula that recognizes the dialectical relationship between individual agency and goal driven, online communities. It is the communities which drive individual motivations to search for new problem solving possibilities, create well functioning communities that are capable of organizing and differentiating distributed sources of information, and act as inflection points in the flow of information, recognizing that knowledge is not an object but an ongoing activity. These types of communities are currently relatively rare, especially for distributed populations who do share an initial stake in its goals. One of the few places many students might be able to experience these types of communities and build their Internet skills and self-efficacies are in consciously designed communities provided in traditional education contexts. 21st century education should move (quickly) towards embracing the new types of thinking and intelligence made possible by the Internet through open source educative processes influenced curricula.

Design/methodology/approach Because of taking on the spatiotemporal characteristics, panel data can well-describe and depict the systematic and dynamic of the decision objects. However, it is difficult for traditional panel data analysis methods to efficiently extract information and rules implied in panel data. To effectively deal with panel data clustering problem, according to the spatiotemporal characteristics of panel data, from the three dimensions of absolute amount level, increasing amount level and volatility level, the authors define the conception of the comprehensive distance between decision objects, and then construct a novel grey incidence analysis clustering approach for panel data and study its computing mechanism of threshold value by exploiting the thought and method of three-way decisions; finally, the authors take a case of the clustering problems on the regional high-tech industrialization in China to illustrate the validity and rationality of the proposed model. Findings The results show that the proposed model can objectively determine the threshold value of clustering and achieve the extraction of information and rules inherent in the data panel. Practical implications - The novel model proposed in the paper can well-describe and resolve panel data clustering problem and efficiently extract information and rules implied in panel data. Originality/value The proposed model can deal with panel data clustering problem and realize the extraction of information and rules inherent in the data panel.

Working memory (WM) is considered responsible for the integration and online manipulation of information, so that it is available for further processing. Since the P300 component of event-related potentials (ERPs) is considered as an index of the,on-line updating of WM, the present study is focused on auditory P300 elicited during a WM test in DMS, compared with that in healthy controls. ERPs, elicited during a WM test, in a case suffering from coinciding Capgras and Fregoli symptoms, were recorded. Peak amplitude and latency of the averaged P300 waveforms, as well as memory performance of this case, were compared to the patterns obtained from healthy controls. In relation to normal controls, the patient exhibited significantly attenuated amplitude of P300 at the F4, P3 and Pz abductions. The patient also showed significantly prolonged latencies of P300 at all abductions used. These findings suggest that DMS may be accompanied by WM dysfunction affecting brain regions outside the prefrontal cortex, as well as within, and by diffuse failure to allocate attention resources to a stimulus, as they are reflected by P300 amplitudes and latencies respectively. Additionally, it may be suggested that techniques designed to explore cognitive operations, such as recording of ERPs, and more specifically P300, during WM tasks, could provide further insights into the relationship between neural functioning and the cognitive deficits in DMS.

J	Chang, K; Yan, L				Chang, Kun; Yan, Li			LLNet: A Fusion Classification Network for Land Localization in Real-World Scenarios	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						lane localization; classification; deep learning	VISUAL LOCALIZATION; VEHICLE NAVIGATION; DETECTION SYSTEM; URBAN AREAS; ROBUST; ENVIRONMENTS; INTEGRATION; LOCATION	Lane localization is one of the core tasks in an autonomous driving system. It receives the visual information collected by the camera and the lane marks and road edges information outputted from the perception module and gives lane index for the subsequent decision module. Traditional rule-based lane localization methods using navigation maps can only be effective in regular road scenarios and have poor generalization ability. High-Definition Map (HD map) was originally thought to solve the lane localization problem, but due to the regulations of the relevant departments, HD map is currently not allowed to be used in autonomous driving systems. In addition, many multi-sensor fusion methods have been proposed to solve the lane localization problem. However, due to the extremely strict safety requirements of autonomous driving systems, these well-designed solutions make it difficult to meet the requirements in terms of robustness, efficiency, and stability. To solve these problems, we innovatively define the lane localization task as a classification problem. First, to better utilize the perceptual information outputted from the perceptual model, we design an image-generating method that projects the perceptual information onto a new image and ensures that our model can learn the perceptual features wisely. Second, to better fuse the perceptual and visual information, we propose a fusion structure deep learning neural network named LLNet to address the lane localization problem in an end-to-end manner. Finally, to ensure the generalization ability, robustness, and stability of LLNet, we conduct extensive comparison experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset, with a total mileage of over 400 km. The experiments show that our approach remarkably outperforms the deep learning classification baselines. In the discussion part of this paper, we give a comprehensive and detailed elaboration for the effectiveness of various designs in our LLNet. To our knowledge, LLNet is the first lane localization method based entirely on deep learning. LLNet is added to the self-driving suite for a kind of mass production vehicle that will be available in the summer of 2022, with an expected sales volume more than 300,000.

Design A critical review. Data sources Literature was searched in CINAHL, PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar and sources published from January 2008 - April 2018 were reviewed. Review methods We screened abstracts and full-texts using specific inclusion criteria, developed summary tables for data extraction and synthesized data logically to develop the framework. Results Twenty-nine sources were reviewed. Recognizing, accepting, and alleviating patients' suffering are direct indicators of compassionate care. Three policy directions were identified: ensure the nursing curriculum has an appropriate balance of teaching-learning strategies that target learning in the affective domain, directly promote the use of reflection and the development of reflective thinking in students as an approach to enhance excellence in clinical practice and integrate information and assess students' understanding and expression of compassion throughout the nursing curriculum. Conclusion Compassion is expressed when nurses authentically work to understand patients' suffering and become sensitive to their experiences. Future research should focus on developing strategies that align with the affective domain and use reflection to optimize nursing students' experiential learning. Impact Policies are needed for cultivating a compassionate care culture and for fostering students' compassion, but no guidelines exist for nursing institutions. Targeting the affective learning domain, facilitating reflection, and integrating compassionate care indicators in clinical learning experiences can be useful. Therefore, nursing institutions can use these findings to integrate and measure compassionate care in clinical and educational curricula to foster students' compassion.

J	Funke, K; Worgotter, F				Funke, K; Worgotter, F			On the significance of temporally structured activity in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)	PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review							CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; OSCILLATORY NEURONAL RESPONSES; THALAMIC RELAY NEURONS; AWAKE MACAQUE MONKEY; Y-CELLS; X-CELLS; RETINOGENICULATE TRANSMISSION; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY	Higher organisms perceive information about external or internal physical or chemical stimuli with specialized sensors that encode characteristics of that stimulus by a train of action potentials. Usually, the location and modality of the stimulus is represented by the location and specificity of the receptor and the intensity of the stimulus and its temporal modulation is thought to be encoded by the instantaneous firing rate. Recent studies have shown that, primarily in cortical structures, special features of a stimulus also are represented in the temporal pattern of spike activity. Typical attributes of this time structure are oscillatory patterns of activity and synchronous discharges in spatially distributed neurons that respond to inputs evoked by a coherent object. The origin and functional significance of this kind of activity is less clear. Cortical, subcortical and even very peripheral sources seem to be involved. Most of the relevant studies were devoted to the mammalian visual system and cortical findings on temporally structured activity were reviewed recently (Eckhorn, 1994, Progr. Brain Res., Vol. 102, pp. 405-426; Singer and Gray, 1995, Annu. Rev. Neurosci., Vol. 18, pp. 555-586). Therefore, this article is designed to give an overview, especially of those studies concerned with the temporal structure of visual activity in subcortical centers of the primary visual pathway, which are the retina and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). We discuss the mechanisms that possibly contribute to the generation and modulation of the subcortical activity time structure and we try to relate to each other the subcortical and cortical patterns of sensory activity.

Professional development should help teachers to reflect on their practice and improve in helping them to guide students' growth. Peer and community models, such as coaching and sharing knowledge in network and knowledge communities, have been proposed. Recently these practices have been taken into use in social media services, such as Facebook. Although earlier research has examined teachers' online communities, we move beyond understanding individuals motivations and examine community-level dynamics. Understanding these dynamics is important to understand the interaction between teachers, resources and the platform in use and resulting professional development. To understand the evolution of an informal and self-organised Facebook teachers' group, containing nearly 20,000 teachers, its eight years of activity was analysed by employing a mixed-methods research design; data science and participatory observation. Analysis gives account of both the evolution of participants' engagement and activity, and the evolution of content and its relevance for teachers' professional development. The results suggest that managers of professional development need to consider how to facilitate participation in order to focus on pedagogically motivated use of information technology, for system developers to consider how to assist recruitment of members and sustain their activity, and for all stakeholders to acknowledge that a peer-organised online professional development community requires significant effort. Furthermore, we suggest that instead of addressing large groups like these as communities, scholars and practitioners should instead see them as personal learning networks and think about how to establish smaller and more manageable groups as communities.

Literature on learning support in digital game-based learning (DGBL) rarely investigate learners' support-use behaviors and interaction patterns in relation to math learning. We addressed this research gap in this exploratory mixed-methods study. We designed and developed a packet of learning supports (i.e., Task Planner and Math Story) in a math DGBLE. Task Planner is designed to assist learners' systematic and planned efforts for math problem solving whereas Math Story features historical stories and real-life applications of math concepts. With the data collected via mixed-methods approach, we extracted six clusters of learning-support-use behaviors via unsupervised machine learning technique (i.e., Gaussian Mixture Model), including 1) skills development and application of mathematical problem decomposition, 2) conceptual knowledge development, 3) metacognitive mathematical connections, 4) metacognitive regulation, 5) information selection using cognitive aids, and 6) sustained motivation for necessary aversive practices. Qualitative multi-cases study revealed nuanced details regarding learners' interactions with the learning supports in DGBLE. Results showed that the designed in-game learning supports facilitated individual meaningful and mindful math problem-solving experiences. The findings suggested that a mixed-methods research design integrating machine learning with multi-cases study could act as a tool for learner behavior and interaction pattern research that informs the design of adaptive and effective DGBL.

J	Clapham, JC; Wilderspin, AF				Clapham, JC; Wilderspin, AF			Cloning of dog heart PDE1A - a first detailed characterization at the molecular level in this species	GENE			English	Article						phosphodiesterase; purification; kinetics; inhibitors; peptide sequencing; rapid amplification of cDNA ends	CYCLIC-NUCLEOTIDE PHOSPHODIESTERASE; CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PHOSPHODIESTERASE; AMP PHOSPHODIESTERASE; EXPRESSION; TISSUE; BRAIN; INHIBITORS; ISOFORMS; 63-KDA; 61-KDA	The dog, as a model for cardiovascular function, has been widely used in the pharmacological analysis of PDE inhibitors, particularly those thought to target the heart. However biochemical analyses of dog heart PDE have been largely performed on mixed enzyme populations, sequence information is lacking and no PDE from dog heart has been cloned. We have characterized a completely purified PDE1 enzyme from dog heart using dye-affinity, Mono-Q and calmodulin-affinity chromatography. The enzyme was stimulated 3-4-fold by calmodulin ([S] = 0.5 muM) and, in the absence of calmodulin, exhibited biphasic kinetics with a low K-m of 1.2 muM and 0.53 muM for cAMP and cGMP, with respective V-max values of 283 and 146 nmoles min(-1) mg(-1). Internal peptides from this enzyme were used to design degenerate PCR primers. Subsequent 3 ' -RACE, 5 ' -RACE and high fidelity PCR were then used to produce a full length gene identified as PDE1A1 by sequence identity to human and bovine sequences. Northern analysis using the dog heart cDNA as a probe suggested the presence of an additional form of PDE1, in heart only, separate from the PDE1A group which was present in both heart and skeletal muscle. Multiple forms of human PDE1A are known to exist and PDE1B is present in human heart muscle. The findings here extend the PDE1 data to the dog and contribute to our understanding of the molecular biology of PDE1A in this species. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gullick, MM; Temple, E				Gullick, Margaret M.; Temple, Elise			Are historic years understood as numbers or events? An fMRI study of numbers with semantic associations	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						fMRI; Number; Numerical processing; Semantics; World knowledge	WORLD KNOWLEDGE; REPRESENTATION; CORTEX; BRAIN; COMPREHENSION	While numbers generally cue processing of quantity or order, they can also contain semantic information, as in the case of historic years (e.g., "1492" calls forth associations of Columbus sailing the ocean blue). Whether these dates are processed as quantities or events may depend on the context in which they occur. We examined such "ambiguous number" processing in two different contexts using a paired-comparison task, recording both behavioral responses and brain activity. Participants were either asked to think of all items as numbers and to choose the larger number, or were told to treat the comparators as events and to choose the later event. Behaviorally, all events showed a normal distance effect, establishing that they may be understood and compared in an ordinal sequence. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) demonstrated significant differences between years when treated as numbers versus as events. Dates in both contexts shared activity in parietal lobe regions previously implicated in number processing. Dates as numbers showed no extra-numeric activity, while dates thought of as events evoked activity in temporal semantic processing and frontal semantic retrieval areas. These differences suggest that extra-numeric information may be easily accessed and incorporated during processing when supported by even a weak context. This work supports previous studies showing a dissociation between quantity and meaning, and illustrates the brain areas involved in these different aspects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, most implementations developed to take advantage of this framework revolve around controlling the measurements with carefully engineered material or acquisition sequences. Instead, we use the natural randomness of wave propagation through multiply scattering media as an optimal and instantaneous compressive imaging mechanism. Waves reflected from an object are detected after propagation through a well-characterized complex medium. Each local measurement thus contains global information about the object, yielding a purely analog compressive sensing method. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for optical imaging by using a 300-micrometer thick layer of white paint as the compressive imaging device. Scattering media are thus promising candidates for designing efficient and compact compressive imagers.

Objectives: To estimate the association between pre-pregnancy history of PMS and development of PPD and evaluate the risk of bias of included evidence. Search strategy: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang Data, and reference lists of relevant papers were searched. Selection criteria: Observational studies that collected pre-pregnancy history of PMS and measured PPD status between one week and one year after delivery were included. Data collection and analysis: This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Random-effect models were used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Small study effect was analysed by funnel plot. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias Instrument for Non-Randomized Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E). Main results: Our meta-analysis included 19 studies. Overall, women with a pre-pregnancy history of PMS had more than double the odds of PPD compared to those without PMS (OR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.81-2.68). However, the quality of evidence was low: five studies had moderate risk, eleven studies had serious risk, and three studies had critical risk of bias. Conclusions: Current evidence supports a significant association between history of PMS and development of PPD. Well-designed prospective studies are needed to further investigate this relationship.

While there have been demonstrations of its utility using crude antigenic preparations of porcine zona pellucida, refined, cheap and easily delivered vaccines are still in the early phases of development, especially those required for remote delivery to free-ranging wild animal populations. The relative slow emergence of such technologies for practical application clearly reflects the complexity of the science and the requirement for a multidisciplinary research approach when attempting to develop such technologies for wild animal management. In many cases, one of the areas where further information is required is the immunobiology of such target species. Effective immunocontraceptive vaccines will also be critically dependent upon the design of the delivery systems. These will be unique to each species under study. A major challenge for free-ranging species will be to ensure that the vaccine can induce a long-lasting immune response to a high percentage of the target population, thus reducing the frequency and, hence, the cost of vaccine application. Many of the delivery systems being considered will utilise recombinant organisms. Hence, considerations on the use of such organisms needs to take into account the political, ethical and safety constraints prior to any environmental release. Also of prime importance is the issue of species specificity. In some instances, this will be a major challenge and careful thought will need to be given to ensure that specificity can be built into the vaccine at several levels. These might include the target antigen or epitopes, the microbial or other delivery vector, and, where applicable, the bait matrix and any target-specific attractive properties it may require. If these caveats can be satisfied and the public is able to accept the use of such vaccines, the potential for their application to manage animal populations and their impact is most certainly assured.

J	Winstein, C; Varghese, R				Winstein, Carolee; Varghese, Rini			Been there, done that, so what's next for arm and hand rehabilitation in stroke?	NEUROREHABILITATION			English	Review						Arm and hand rehabilitation; stroke recovery; neural networks; biopsychosocial factors	CONSTRAINT-INDUCED MOVEMENT; UPPER-LIMB RECOVERY; MOTOR CORTEX; PREMOTOR CORTEX; INDUCED THERAPY; DOSE-RESPONSE; SELF-EFFICACY; POSTSTROKE; INDIVIDUALS; ACTIVATION	BACKGROUND: The extraordinary advances in technology such as body-worn sensors, health information technologies, technological advances in neuroimaging, and computational approaches to predictive modelling using biomarkers offers considerable promise to literally transform our thinking, our approach to the problem, and the design of future clinical trials about arm and hand rehabilitation after stroke. OBJECTIVE: To provide a focused review that considers the past, present and future of arm and hand rehabilitation in stroke. METHOD: We organized this perspective into three parts: 1) Past-we summarize the past decade of the clinical trial enterprise in neurorehabilitation, 2) Present-we provide a brief review of three research areas where mechanistic studies that rely on uniquely human neural circuits provide a basis for promising intervention tools, and 3) Future-we highlight three unique research domains that are likely to provide the biggest impact on the future of post-stroke arm and hand recovery. RESULTS: The past has not been a complete failure-in particular, the EXCITE RCT put arm and hand rehabilitation on the map. Unfortunately, the majority of clinical trials that followed were based on an immature science of neurorehabilitation. We got drawn in by the seductive preclinical animal model work which suggested that dose and intensity of task-oriented training was the most important ingredient for fostering recovery in humans. While dose, and intensity are clearly important, they are of little value unless the stroke survivor is engaged, motivated, and the neural infrastructure provides enough resource to allow the recovery process. Recently, we noticed an increase in mechanistic and theory-driven studies, findings from which will not only advance our understanding of critical brain-behavior mechanisms, but will provide a more mature science moving into the future. CONCLUSIONS: The good news is that there is evidence that we learned from the past and have invented a future that appears to be much more exciting and promising than the past.

J	Mukhtarov, F				Mukhtarov, Farhad			Combining behavioural and reflective policy tools for the environment: a scoping review of behavioural public policy literature	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Review; Early Access						nudge; frame; deliberation; policy mixes; review; environment	CLIMATE-CHANGE; GOVERNANCE; NUDGE; COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION; SCIENCE; DESIGN; ETHICS; WORK	Recent advances in behavioural and communication sciences generated enthusiasm in public policy for new ways of 'framing' messages and 'nudging' individual behaviour. Wide research and practice of behavioural interventions that have since ensued triggered the rise of a new sub-field called Behavioural Public Policy (BPP). At the same time, nudges - a part and parcel of BPP, have received criticism for being paternalistic, non-democratic and lacking evidence of long-term effectiveness. More recently, the whole project of BPP has come under criticism as construed too narrowly. Critics have argued for a new approach to BPP that is pluralistic, multi-disciplinary and multi-method. One key pillar of it is a 'policy mix' - a combined application of behavioural and non-behavioural policy tools. Little is known, however, about 'policy mixes' in practice. This paper conducts a scoping non-exhaustive review of the academic and policy literature published between 2008 and 2020 that discusses policy mixes of behavioural policy tools (defined in this paper as 'nudges' and 'frames') and reflective policy tools (defined in this paper as 'deliberative' events and incentives for individuals to 'think') employed within environmental policy. Two questions guide this review: (a) what are the characteristics of policy mixes in terms of their types, geography, sectors of application, and empirical detail of exposition?; (b) to what extent do existing policy mixes include broader governance aspects of politics, awareness of contextuality and flexibility? By taking stock of experiences of empirical place-based policy mixes of behavioural and reflective tools, we provide insights into a fast-developing body of scholarship and point to ways forward with policy mixes. The paper is also relevant to policy studies beyond the domain of the environment.

Privacy Attitudes among Early Adopters of Emerging Health Technologies	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PERSONAL GENOME PROJECT	Introduction Advances in health technology such as genome sequencing and wearable sensors now allow for the collection of highly granular personal health data from individuals. It is unclear how people think about privacy in the context of these emerging health technologies. An open question is whether early adopters of these advances conceptualize privacy in different ways than non-early adopters. Purpose This study sought to understand privacy attitudes of early adopters of emerging health technologies. Methods Transcripts from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with early adopters of genome sequencing and health devices and apps were analyzed with a focus on participant attitudes and perceptions of privacy. Themes were extracted using inductive content analysis. Results Although interviewees were willing to share personal data to support scientific advancements, they still expressed concerns, as well as uncertainty about who has access to their data, and for what purpose. In short, they were not dismissive of privacy risks. Key privacy related findings are organized into four themes as follows: first, personal data privacy; second, control over personal information; third, concerns about discrimination; and fourth, contributing personal data to science. Conclusion Early adopters of emerging health technologies appear to have more complex and nuanced conceptions of privacy than might be expected based on their adoption of personal health technologies and participation in open science. Early adopters also voiced uncertainty about the privacy implications of their decisions to use new technologies and share their data for research. Though not representative of the general public, studies of early adopters can provide important insights into evolving attitudes toward privacy in the context of emerging health technologies and personal health data research.

There have also been few attempts to analyse gender specific uses of social media. This paper investigated young boys health-related learning in relation to social media. Data were generated from class activities and interviews and from a large data set that included 1346 young people. The approach to the empirical data adopted was Practical Epistemology Analysis (PEA). The findings reveal two main purposes of young boys engagement with social media: (i) communicating with friends, and (ii) accessing health-related information. Irony and humour were central learning mechanisms used by young boys to participate within health-related social media, and in a way that enabled them to engage with, uphold, and handle health discourses associated with masculinity ? such as being ripped ? without fear of ?literal? peer ridicule and within a context of acceptable ?banter?. There was evidence that young people were critical users and generators of social media, who were clearly thinking through what they see, do, and use online. Hence, this paper provides a fresh evidence-based perspective on the potentially positive role of social media as a health-related learning resource. PEA is illustrated as a new methodological approach for investigating learning in the context of social media. The evidence generated can be used to inform future evaluations of social media use, the design of educative support for young people, and guidance and training for key stakeholders.

Through the analysis of two-dimensional code recognition technology architecture and common application fields, an intelligent nursing teaching platform for two-dimensional code online testing technology was designed. Systematically, we summarize the advantages of intelligent nursing teaching platform, use flash and 3D technology to complete the virtualization of nursing teaching scene, and use XML technology to update and save teaching resources; we further build an intelligent nursing teaching platform by using the basic plate, nursing station plate, ward plate, dispensing room plate, and case and operation review plate. The experimental results show that under the two-dimensional code online test technology, the nursing teaching method in colleges and universities has strong teaching resource processing efficiency, improves the operation level of students' nursing technology, and effectively cultivates the academic thinking of nursing students, which is of great significance to the progress of nursing teaching.

This disconnect is a problem particularly for population health, where the change agents who can make the biggest difference in improving health behaviors and social and environmental conditions are generally nonscientists outside of the health professions. To persuade an audience that does not read scientific journals, strong science may not be enough to elicit change. Achieving influence in population health often requires four ingredients for success: research that is responsive to user needs, an understanding of the decision-making environment, effective stakeholder engagement, and strategic communication. This article reviews the principles and provides examples from a national and local initiative.

However, related researches are based on the assumption that there is an interval between two activities, during which the target is thought to be static. This assumption falls short of reality as human activities are performed continuously in daily life. Therefore, this article aims to design a nonintrusive and privacy-protected system, namely, Wi-Monitor, to monitor human activities in daily life. In Wi-Monitor, we first fragmentize Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) streams into CSI bins and design a feature extraction network to extract activity fragmentation features (AFFs) from these CSI bins. From the extracted AFFs, a temporal convolutional network (TCN) is further used to capture activity continuity features (ACFs), which are used as distinguishing characteristics of continuous activities. Finally, Wi-Monitor utilizes these distinguishing characteristics to segment and recognize human activities in daily life simultaneously to achieve daily activity monitoring. In addition, we design an over-segmentation suppression mechanism with two training stages in Wi-Monitor to overcome the over-segmentation issue and enhance the activity monitoring accuracy. Intensive experiments are conducted in three different scenarios and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of Wi-Monitor for daily activity monitoring.

NPSs are designed to resemble the effects of classical drugs of abuse, reinforcing their effects and duration. Among the most abused NPS, synthetic cannabinoids are cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs) that mimic the effect of the main psychotropic phytocannabinoid Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Methods: We herein reviewed the international literature to provide available information on the newest SCRAs generation. Results: Compared to the previous SCRAs generations, the structures of the last generation result in increased affinity for and efficacy at cannabinoid CB1 receptors, which are thought to be mainly responsible for the psychoactive effects of THC and its analogues. Accordingly, these more potent cannabimimetic effects may increase the number of adverse reactions such as neurological disorders (e.g., psychosis, agitation, irritability, paranoia, confusion, and anxiety), psychiatric episodes (e.g., hallucinations, delusions, self-harm), other physical conditions (e.g., tachycardia, hypertension, arrhythmia, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever) and deaths. In the last decade, more than a hundred SCRAs from different chemical classes emerged on the illicit web market. SCRAs have been thoroughly studied: they were physico-chemically characterized, and pharmaco-toxicological characteristics were investigated. The last SCRAs generations include increasingly potent and toxic compounds, posing a potential health threat to consumers. Conclusion: From November 2017 to February 2021, at least 20 new "fourth-generation" SCRAs were formally reported to international drug agencies. Our understanding of the neurotoxicity of these compounds is still limited due to the lack of global data, but their potency and their toxicity are likely higher than those of the previous generations.

Bilateral Field Advantage in Visual Enumeration	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MAGIC NUMBER 4; INTERHEMISPHERIC INTERACTION; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; HEMISPHERES; CAPACITY; SYSTEMS; SPECIALIZATION; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; HEMIFIELDS	A number of recent studies have demonstrated superior visual processing when the information is distributed across the left and right visual fields than if the information is presented in a single hemifield (the bilateral field advantage). This effect is thought to reflect independent attentional resources in the two hemifields and the capacity of the neural responses to the left and right hemifields to process visual information in parallel. Here, we examined whether a bilateral field advantage can also be observed in a high-level visual task that requires the information from both hemifields to be combined. To this end, we used a visual enumeration task-a task that requires the assimilation of separate visual items into a single quantity-where the to-be-enumerated items were either presented in one hemifield or distributed between the two visual fields. We found that enumerating large number (> 4 items), but not small number (< 4 items), exhibited the bilateral field advantage: enumeration was more accurate when the visual items were split between the left and right hemifields than when they were all presented within the same hemifield. Control experiments further showed that this effect could not be attributed to a horizontal alignment advantage of the items in the visual field, or to a retinal stimulation difference between the unilateral and bilateral displays. These results suggest that a bilateral field advantage can arise when the visual task involves inter-hemispheric integration. This is in line with previous research and theory indicating that, when the visual task is attentionally demanding, parallel processing by the neural responses to the left and right hemifields can expand the capacity of visual information processing.

Currently, their effectiveness in fostering experiential learning and skill acquisition in several areas is already supported by the existing evidence, mainly about the potential of digital games. Paradoxically, the current post-digital era seems to have led to a growing popularity of analog games. The present Systematic Literature Review aimed to map the existing literature on the potential of board, tabletop, or other analog games in learning processes. It intended to systematize the contemporary state of the art (2012-2022) around the pedagogical role of these games, their effectiveness, the promoted learning outcomes, the methodological aspects of the interventions, the used games-including mechanics and other characteristics-and the current discussions around inclusion and accessibility in analog game-based learning. Adopting the PRISMA methodology, we searched ACM Digital Library, EBSCO, ERIC, Scopus-Elsevier, and Web of Science databases, as well as other peer-reviewed "grey literature" sources. The search resulted in an initial sample of 2,741 articles that was then screened by inclusion and exclusion criteria previously defined according to the research objectives. We obtained a final sample of 45 articles. To formulate the mapping of existing research, these studies were analyzed using a combination of statistical, content, and critical analysis procedures. The obtained results support the role of board, tabletop, and other analog games in educational contexts-based on their educational potential-with a broad range of knowledge, cognitive, and psychological outcomes. The study also emphasized the relevance of these games in the promotion of soft skills and other aspects typically associated with meaningful learning, such as engagement, satisfaction, flexibility, and freedom of experimentation. However, important limitations were found in a fair amount of the pedagogical approaches studied, which can be mostly attributed to the low prevalence of modern board games that relate what is intended to be learned to aspects of game design and have little to no consideration of accessibility and inclusion aspects in these studies.

Two views of attentional WM maintenance have been suggested to account for the long-term retention of WM information. First, the distractors in a WM task are thought to foster the creation of episodic memory cues through covert retrieval. Second, the cognitive load (CL) of the distractors is thought to vary long-term memory instantiation. In this study, we propose an additional parsimonious perspective: the total time during which each trace is under the control of attention in WM is the key to long-term retention. Participants performed a complex span task in which the CL and number of distractors were orthogonally manipulated, and thereafter the participants performed a delayed recall test. Similar to previous findings, the results showed effects of the number of distractors and of CL on delayed recall. Our results went further, however, by showing a non-linear relationship between delayed recall performance and the free time accumulated between encoding and immediate recall. The role of time in episodic memory performance and the underlying WM maintenance mechanism are discussed.

Weather maps are therefore widely used and many users use them in everyday life. To identify the potential usability problems of weather web maps, the presented research was conducted. Five weather maps were selected for an eye-tracking experiment based on the results of an online questionnaire: DarkSky, In-Poasi, Windy, YR.no, and Wundermap. The experiment was conducted with 34 respondents and consisted of introductory, dynamic, and static sections. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of recorded data was performed together with a think-aloud protocol. The main part of the paper describes the results of the eye-tracking experiment and the implemented research, which identify the strengths and weaknesses of the evaluated weather web maps and point out the differences between strategies in using maps by the respondents. The results include findings such as the following: users worked with web maps in the simplest form and they did not look for hidden functions in the menu or attempt to find any advanced functionality; if expandable control panels were available, the respondents only looked at them after they had examined other elements; map interactivity was not an obstacle unless it contained too much information or options to choose from; searching was quicker in static menus that respondents did not have to switch on or off; the graphic design significantly influenced respondents and their work with the web maps. The results of the work may be useful for further scientific research on weather web maps and related user issues.

Perceptions of health risks associated with pregnancy compared to oral contraceptive use	CONTRACEPTION			English	Article						Reproductive health literacy; Oral contraceptive health risks; Pregnancy health risks; Shared decision making; Oral contraceptive safety		Objective: To assess beliefs about the safety of oral contraceptives compared to pregnancy to determine if men and women possess accurate information to make informed choices. Study design: In each of six surveys conducted in Southern California from 2008 to 2017, participants were asked "Which do you think is more hazardous to a woman's health - birth control pills or pregnancy?" Results: A total of 28.4% of all 1839 male and female respondents and 29.1% of the 1712 female respondents answered correctly that the health risks posed by pregnancy were greater. In subgroup analyses, 64.4%-81.9% rated oral contraceptives at least as hazardous to a woman's health as pregnancy. Conclusion: The vast majority of respondents incorrectly believed that oral contraceptives are more hazardous than pregnancy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A semi-holographic hyperdimensional representation system for hardware-friendly cognitive computing	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						hyperdimensional; hardware; processor		One of the main, long-term objectives of artificial intelligence is the creation of thinking machines. To that end, substantial effort has been placed into designing cognitive systems; i.e. systems that can manipulate semantic-level information. A substantial part of that effort is oriented towards designing the mathematical machinery underlying cognition in a way that is very efficiently implementable in hardware. In this work, we propose a 'semi-holographic' representation system that can be implemented in hardware using only multiplexing and addition operations, thus avoiding the need for expensive multiplication. The resulting architecture can be readily constructed by recycling standard microprocessor elements and is capable of performing two key mathematical operations frequently used in cognition, superposition and binding, within a budget of below 6 pJ for 64-bit operands. Our proposed 'cognitive processing unit' is intended as just one (albeit crucial) part of much larger cognitive systems where artificial neural networks of all kinds and associative memories work in concord to give rise to intelligence. This article is part of the theme issue 'Harmonizing energy-autonomous computing and intelligence'.

Design and methods: The population of this descriptive and relationship-seeking study comprised 170 schizophrenia patients followed-up in the CMHC. Study data were collected using the Information Form, the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS), the Social Functioning Assessment Scale (SFAS), and the Coping Orientation of Problem Experience (COPE). Findings: A moderately significant positive correlation between cognitive insight and social functionality was determined. It was found that participants with high cognitive insight and social functionality used more problem- and emotion-focused coping methods. Application implications: It is thought that practices that improve cognitive insight and social functionality will contribute to the rehabilitation of patients with schizophrenia by supporting their coping skills.

Prospective primary teachers were asked to describe and interpret the answers of three primary students to three linear pattern generalization problems. Five profiles for this competence have been identified. Prospective teachers named various mathematical elements to describe the students' answers but did not always use them to interpret the understanding of pattern generalization of each student. Furthermore, this teaching competence ranges from the PPTs who could not recognize the understanding of the primary students to those capable of recognizing degrees of primary students' understanding. Our findings allow one to generate descriptors of the development of this teaching competence and provide information for the design of interventions in teacher education addressed to support the recognition of evidence of students' mathematical understanding.

Recent advances toward the discovery of underlying mechanisms have been achieved using experimental electrophysiology, multichannel electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. By the careful dosing of various volatile and IV anesthetic agents to the level of behavioral unresponsiveness, both specific and common changes in functional and effective connectivity across large-scale brain networks have been discovered and interpreted in the context of how the synthesis of neural information might be affected during anesthesia. The results of most investigations to date converge toward the conclusion that a common neural correlate of anesthetic-induced unresponsiveness is a consistent depression or functional disconnection of lateral frontoparietal networks, which are thought to be critical for consciousness of the environment. A reduction in the repertoire of brain states may contribute to the anesthetic disruption of large-scale information integration leading to unconsciousness. In future investigations, a systematic delineation of connectivity changes with multiple anesthetics using the same experimental design, and the same analytical method will be desirable. The critical neural events that account for the transition between responsive and unresponsive states should be assessed at similar anesthetic doses just below and above the loss or return of responsiveness. There will also be a need to identify a robust, sensitive, and reliable measure of information transfer. Ultimately, finding a behavior-independent measure of subjective experience that can track covert cognition in unresponsive subjects and a delineation of causal factors versus correlated events will be essential to understand the neuronal basis of human consciousness and unconsciousness.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between awareness of cervical cancer and HPV infection and attitudes towards HPV vaccine among women aged 15-49 years. DESIGN AND SETTING:Cross-sectional study conducted at Karabuk Training and Research Hospital, Turkey. METHODS: 500 women who visited the gynecology outpatient clinic of a public hospital between July 15 and December 31, 2019, were selected through random sampling. Data were collected using a sociodemographic questionnaire comprising nine questions (created by the researchers), the HPV and Cervical Cancer Awareness Questionnaire and the Carolina HPV Immunization Attitudes and Beliefs Scale. RESULTS: The relationship between the awareness questionnaire and the beliefs scale was explained through simple effect modeling of a structural equation.The women's knowledge score regarding cervical cancer and HPV infection was 4.69 +/- 4.02 out of 15. Women were afraid of being diagnosed with cervical cancer and HPV infection, but they did not have sufficient information. They had poor information about the HPV vaccine, did not know how to obtain the vaccine and did not have enough information about its benefits and harmful effects. Women who were afraid of getting cervical cancer, and who thought that they were at risk, had more information about the HPV vaccine. CONCLUSION: Women need information about cervical cancer, HPV infection and the HPV vaccine. Midwives, nurses and physicians who provide healthcare services in gynecological follow-ups should provide information to women about the HPV vaccine and cervical cancer.

Scalable Microfabrication Procedures for Adhesive-Integrated Flexible and Stretchable Electronic Sensors	SENSORS			English	Article						flexible electronics; roll-to-roll; peel-off; flexible sensors	EPIDERMAL ELECTRONICS; SURFACE MODIFICATION; HIGH-DENSITY; FABRICATION; DEVICES; STRAIN; DESIGN; FILMS; SEMITRANSPARENT; TRANSISTORS	New classes of ultrathin flexible and stretchable devices have changed the way modern electronics are designed to interact with their target systems. Though more and more novel technologies surface and steer the way we think about future electronics, there exists an unmet need in regards to optimizing the fabrication procedures for these devices so that large-scale industrial translation is realistic. This article presents an unconventional approach for facile microfabrication and processing of adhesive-peeled (AP) flexible sensors. By assembling AP sensors on a weakly-adhering substrate in an inverted fashion, we demonstrate a procedure with 50% reduced end-to-end processing time that achieves greater levels of fabrication yield. The methodology is used to demonstrate the fabrication of electrical and mechanical flexible and stretchable AP sensors that are peeled-off their carrier substrates by consumer adhesives. In using this approach, we outline the manner by which adhesion is maintained and buckling is reduced for gold film processing on polydimethylsiloxane substrates. In addition, we demonstrate the compatibility of our methodology with large-scale post-processing using a roll-to-roll approach.

BackgroundPressure injury development is still a problem in hospitals. It is important to understand how new information and communication technologies can facilitate pressure injury prevention. MethodA descriptive design with qualitative focus group interviews was used. ResultsFive categories were identified: Need of information, training and coaching over a long period of time, Pressure mapping - a useful tool in the prevention of pressure injury in high risk patients, Easy to understand and use, but some practical issues were annoying, New way of working and thinking, and Future possibilities with the pressure mapping system. ConclusionThe pressure mapping system was an eye-opener for the importance of pressure injury prevention. Staff appreciated the real-time feedback on pressure points, which alerted them to the time for repositioning, facilitated repositioning and provided feedback on the repositioning performed. Implications for Nursing ManagementA continuous pressure mapping system can be used as a catalyst, increasing staff's competence, focus and awareness of prevention. For successful implementation, the nurse managers should have a shared agenda with the clinical nurse leaders, supporting the sustaining and spread of the innovation.

J	Zhang, H; Yan, HM; Kendrick, KM; Li, CY				Zhang, Hao; Yan, Hong-Mei; Kendrick, Keith M.; Li, Chao-Yi			Both Lexical and Non-Lexical Characters Are Processed during Saccadic Eye Movements	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TIME; COMPRESSION; SUPPRESSION; SPACE	On average our eyes make 3-5 saccadic movements per second when we read, although their neural mechanism is still unclear. It is generally thought that saccades help redirect the retinal fovea to specific characters and words but that actual discrimination of information only occurs during periods of fixation. Indeed, it has been proposed that there is active and selective suppression of information processing during saccades to avoid experience of blurring due to the high-speed movement. Here, using a paradigm where a string of either lexical (Chinese) or non-lexical (alphabetic) characters are triggered by saccadic eye movements, we show that subjects can discriminate both while making saccadic eye movement. Moreover, discrimination accuracy is significantly better for characters scanned during the saccadic movement to a fixation point than those not scanned beyond it. Our results showed that character information can be processed during the saccade, therefore saccades during reading not only function to redirect the fovea to fixate the next character or word but allow pre-processing of information from the ones adjacent to the fixation locations to help target the next most salient one. In this way saccades can not only promote continuity in reading words but also actively facilitate reading comprehension.

However the reported frequency of these viruses varies widely, likely reflecting differences in PCR methodologies used for detection. Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) is a third generation PCR technology that enables the absolute quantification of target DNA molecules. Mounting evidence of the biological differences between HHV-6A and HHV-6B has led to their recent reclassification as separate species. As it is now especially relevant to investigate each virus, our objectives were to first design a multiplex HHV-6A and HHV-6B ddPCR assay and then to investigate the incidence of HHV-6A and HHV-6B coinfection in samples from healthy donors and patients with MS, a disease in which HHV-6 is thought to play a role. In our assessment of healthy donors, we observed a heretofore-underappreciated high frequency of coinfection in PBMC and serum, and found that our assay precisely detects both HHV6A and HHV-6B chromosomally integrated virus, which has important implications in clinical settings. Interestingly, upon comparing the saliva from MS patients and healthy donors, we detected a significantly elevated frequency of coinfection in MS saliva; increased detection of HHV-6A in MS patients is consistent with other studies suggesting that this viral species (thought to be more neurotropic than HHV-6B) is more prevalent among MS patients compared to healthy donors. As the biology and disease associations between these two viral species differ, identifying and quantifying both species of HHV-6 may provide clinically relevant information, as well as enhance our understanding of the roles of each in health and disease.

Methods: A random sample of primary schoolchildren was examined for dental caries utilizing World Health Organization criteria for diagnosis of caries. The information regarding oral health knowledge, attitude and practices in schoolteachers was collected through an especially designed self-administered questionnaire. Results: The prevalence of caries among the sample was 94.4%. The mean decayed, missing and filled score for primary teeth of the sample was 6.3 (+/-3.5), with decay component of 4.9 (+/-3.1), missing component of 1.1 (+/-1.7) and filled component of 0.3 (+/-1.0). The mean decayed, missing and filled score for permanent teeth of the sample was 1.6 (+/-1.5) with decay component of 1.5 (+/-1.4) as the major component. All the teachers (100%) thought that good dental health was important for general health and that routine check up dental visits help in maintaining good dental health. All the teachers (100%) thought that tooth cleaning using brush or miswak was important for good dental health. Regarding the caries risk factors, the majority of teachers understood the main causes of dental caries such as poor oral hygiene (97.4%) and high sugar intake (91.4%). Almost all the teachers (97.4%) thought that dental health lectures were of great importance for their students but less than half (41%) actually spent time on teaching proper oral health care. Conclusions: The caries prevalence in Riyadh primary schoolchildren is very high. The teachers' knowledge regarding oral health is satisfactory and their attitude towards oral health is very positive.

However, our review of papers in the two leading IS journals from 2000 to 2016 suggests that IS research has lost sight of the discipline's sociotechnical character-a character that was widely acknowledged at the discipline's inception. This is a problem because an axis of cohesion can be fundamental to a discipline's long-term vitality. In order to address this issue, we offer ways to renew the sociotechnical perspective so that it can continue to serve as a distinctive and coherent foundation for the discipline. Our hope is that the renewed sociotechnical frame for the IS discipline discussed in the paper holds potential to contribute to the enduring strength of our diverse, distinctive, yet unified discipline. It also prompts members of the discipline to think more deeply about what it means to be an IS scholar.

Judgments often follow the given information uncritically, even when it is easy to find out or explicitly explained that information samples are misleading or invalid. The present research is concerned with metacognitive myopia in judgments of change. Participants had to decide whether pairs of binomial samples were drawn from populations with decreasing, equal, or increasing proportions p of a critical feature. Judgments of p changes were strongly affected by changes in absolute sample size n, such that only increases (decreases) in p that came along with increasing (decreasing) n were readily detected. Across 4 experiments these anomalies persisted even though the distinction of p and n was strongly emphasized through outcome feedback and full debriefing (Experiment 1-4), simultaneous presentation (Experiments 2-4), and recoding of experienced samples into descriptive percentages (Experiment 3-4). In Experiment 4, a joint attempt was made by 10 scientists working in 7 different institutions to develop an effective debiasing training, suggesting how multilab-collaboration might improve the quality of science in the early stage of operational research designing. Despite significant improvements in change judgments, debiasing treatments did not eliminate the anomalies. Possible ways of dealing with the metacognitive deficit are discussed.

Objective: We aimed to investigate the perceptions and opinions of general practitioners (GPs) on the integrated health care system. Methods: A cross-sectional investigation involving 764 GPs in Hubei province of China was conducted. We used a self-designed questionnaire to collect information on demographics, GPs' knowledge and attitude of the integrated health care system. Data on 749 GPs with completed questionnaires were analysed descriptively. We conducted Spearman rank correlation analysis to test correlation of grade data. Results: 60.92% of the 749 GPs were familiar with the integrated health care system. 88.25% of the GPs were apt to support its development and 70.09% thought it could promote downward referral of patients. The GPs' familiarity with the integrated health care system was significantly related to professional guidance from doctors in higher hospitals (P < 0.05), but not job titles of GPs (P > 0.05). 78.0% of GPs thought that the main benefit of the integrated health care system was the reduction of patients' health care costs; 70.1% believed that the most difficulty was insufficient publicity. Conclusions: The GPs' general cognition of the integrated health care system was general. Most of the GPs supported the integrated health care system and believed that it contributed to decrease the patients' health care costs. Insufficient publicity and the incomplete two-way referral mechanism were regarded to be the main obstacles to its development.

The focus groups included 23 African American, 9 white, 4 Southeast Asian, 1 American Indian, 2 Hispanic American, and 2 Middle Eastern EFNEP participants. Design All focus groups were moderated and co-moderated by University of Minnesota staff members. The focus groups were tape-recorded and transcribed. A written report was generated based on the independent evaluation of two staff members. Results We learned that EFNEP participants thought they would be motivated to change their eating habits for health concerns, including weight loss, and to help their families develop healthful eating habits. They mentioned several barriers to making changes, including extra time and money needed to purchase and prepare healthful foods, food preferences of family members, lack of interest and skills in cooking, and insufficient knowledge about which foods are healthful. Participants shared ideas for program content and delivery. Conclusions Clients with limited literacy skills have valuable opinions and insights that program developers targeting this hard-to-reach group should hear. The EFNEP participants wanted simple, practical, and relevant information about what foods to eat and how to prepare them. They considered lectures an ineffective way to receive nutrition information, and they expressed a preference for hands-on activities that were enjoyable and allowed participants to share ideas and experiences.

Immersive landscapes: modelling ecosystem reference conditions in virtual reality	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						Box gum grassy woodland; Ecosystem models; Eucalyptus albens; Virtual reality; Virtual landscape; Virtual ecology; 3D plant models	RESTORATION; WOODLANDS; DISTURBANCE; ECOLOGY; STATE; SOUND	Context Understanding the variability and dynamics of ecosystems, as well as their responses to climate or land use change, is challenging for policy makers and natural resource managers. Virtual reality (VR) can be used to render virtual landscapes as immersive, visceral experiences and communicate ecosystem dynamics to users in an effective and engaging way. Objectives To illustrate the potential and believability of VR, a team of landscape ecologists and immersive visualisation researchers modelled a reference Australian Box Gum Grassy Woodland landscape, an endangered eucalypt woodland ecosystem that is difficult to observe in its pre-European colonisation form. Methods We document considerations for designing the immersive virtual landscape, including the creation of animated three-dimensional (3D) plants that alternate between the seasons, and soundscapes that change through the course of a simulated day. We used a heuristic evaluation with experts to assess the potential of immersive VR landscape modeling. Results This cross disciplinary collaboration resulted in a VR experience that was evaluated in a series of meetings by 27 ecologists and managers in biodiversity conservation, many of whom were familiar with Box Gum Grassy Woodlands. 88% of participants stated that the simulation was believable and participants thought that virtual landscapes held great potential for education, public engagement and land management. Conclusions Possible future directions include open-source libraries of ecological 3D models, and the visual simulation of historic landscapes and future climate change scenarios.

The 'quecture' is a partially flipped lecture that incorporates students posing their own questions (quecture questions), discussing them during lectures and revisiting them later. These interactive learning events are designed to personalise students' construction of learning during lectures. Quectures were trialled in direct comparison with both fully flipped and traditional lectures, providing information on student attitudes, experiences and engagement with the learning strategy. Quectures were favoured by participants over the two other lecture formats and were found to be helpful both in increasing learning and in improving study habits, although some students had difficulty adjusting to, or disliked, the new mode of learning. The student-posed questions were also perceived by students to improve enquiry skills and to personalise learning. Although many chose not to engage with the strategy, those who did felt more engaged with, and more responsible for their own learning during quectures than in traditional lectures. Future work will be required to generalise the effectiveness of this strategy as well as to fine tune for optimum benefit. It will also be important to investigate which subpopulations of students preferentially engage or disengage with the strategy, and to unpick any relationship between this engagement and academic performance.

Parents/carers report practical and psychosocial barriers to managing their child's eczema, including child resistance. Online interventions could potentially support parents/carers; however, rigorous research developing such interventions has been limited. Aim To develop an online behavioural intervention to help parents/carers manage and co-manage their child's eczema. Design and setting Intervention development using a theory-, evidence-, and person-based approach (PBA) with qualitative research. Method A systematic review and qualitative synthesis of studies (n = 32) and interviews with parents/carers (n = 30) were used to identify barriers and facilitators to effective eczema management, and a prototype intervention was developed. Think-aloud interviews with parents/ carers (n = 25) were then used to optimise the intervention to increase its acceptability and feasibility. Results Qualitative research identified that parents/ carers had concerns about using emollients and TCS, incomplete knowledge and skills around managing eczema, and reluctance to transitioning to co-managing eczema with their child. Think-aloud interviews highlighted that, while experienced parents/carers felt they knew how to manage eczema, some information about how to use treatments was still new. Techniques for addressing barriers included providing a rationale explaining how emollients and TCS work, demonstrating how to use treatments, and highlighting that the intervention provided new, up-to-date information. Conclusion Parents/carers need support in effectively managing and co-managing their child's eczema. The key output of this research is Eczema Care Online for Families, an online intervention for parents/carers of children with eczema, which is being evaluated in a randomised trial.

The importance of social thought and action is hard to overstate. However, is social information so important that it actually determines which stimuli are promoted to conscious experience and which stimuli are suppressed as invisible? To address this question, we used a binocular rivalry paradigm, in which the two eyes receive different action stimuli. In two experiments we measured the conscious percept of rival actions and found that actions engaged in social interactions are granted preferential access to visual awareness over non-interactive actions. Lastly, an attentional task that presumably engaged the mentalizing system enhanced the priority assigned to social interactions in reaching conscious perception. We also found a positive correlation between human identification of interactive activity and the promotion of socially-relevant information to visual awareness. The present findings suggest that the visual system amplifies socially-relevant sensory information and actively promotes it to consciousness, thereby facilitating inferences about social interactions.

However, it is not enough merely to record if an error occurred. For efficient learning, information about the magnitude of errors is critical. Did my tennis swing completely miss the target or did I hit the ball, but not quite in the sweet spot? How can neurons - which have traditionally been thought of as binary units - signal the magnitude of an error? Here I review evidence that eyeblink conditioning - a basic form of motor learning - depends on graded signals from the inferior olive which guides plasticity in the cerebellum and ultimately tunes behavior. Specifically, evidence suggests that: (1) Error signals are conveyed to the cerebellum via the inferior olive; (2) Signals from the inferior olive are graded; (3) The strength of the olivary signal affects learning; (4) Cerebellar feedback influences the strength of the olivary signal. I end the review by exploring how graded error signals might explain some behavioral learning phenomena.

These attacks leverage the unintended artefacts produced as side-effects to certain architectural design choices and proved difficult to be effectively mitigated without incurring significant performance penalties. In this work, we undertake a systematic mapping study of the academic literature related to the aforementioned attacks. We, in particular, pose four research questions and study 104 primary works to answer those questions. We inquire about the origins of artefacts leading up to exploitable settings of microarchitectural side-channel attacks; the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasures; and the lessons to be learned that would help build secure systems for the future. Furthermore, we propose a classification scheme that would also serve in the future for systematic mapping efforts in this scope.

The nanotechnology of life-inspired systems	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							REACTION-DIFFUSION; NANOPARTICLES; CELLS; PRINCIPLES; CATALYSIS; FEEDBACK; NETWORK; DESIGN	For some decades now, nanotechnology has been touted as the 'next big thing' with potential impact comparable to the steam, electricity or Internet revolutions - but has it lived up to these expectations? While advances in top-down nanolithography, now reaching 10-nm resolution, have resulted in devices that are rapidly approaching mass production, attempts to produce nanoscale devices using bottom-up approaches have met with only limited success. We have been inundated with nanoparticles of almost any shape, material and composition, but their societal impact has been far from revolutionary, with growing concerns over their toxicity. Despite nebulous hopes that making hierarchical nanomaterials will lead to new, emergent properties, no breakthrough applications seem imminent. In this Perspective, we argue that the time is ripe to look beyond individual nano-objects and their static assemblies, and instead focus on systems comprising different types of 'nanoparts' interacting and/or communicating with one another to perform desired functions. Such systems are interesting for a variety of reasons: they can act autonomously without external electrical or optical connections, can be dynamic and reconfigurable, and can act as 'nanomachines' by directing the flow of mass, energy or information. In thinking how this systems nanoscience approach could be implemented to design useful - as opposed to toy-model - nanosystems, our choice of applications and our nanoengineering should be inspired by living matter.

The Moderately (D)efficient Enzyme: Catalysis-Related Damage <i>In Vivo</i> and Its Repair	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							TAURINE/ALPHA-KETOGLUTARATE DIOXYGENASE; METABOLITE DAMAGE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; INACTIVATION; MECHANISM; ALDOLASE; PROTEINS; BIOLOGY; REPLACEMENT; METHYLATION	Enzymes have in vivo life spans. Analysis of life spans, i.e., lifetime totals of catalytic turnovers, suggests that nonsurvivable collateral chemical damage from the very reactions that enzymes catalyze is a common but underdiagnosed cause of enzyme death. Analysis also implies that many enzymes are moderately deficient in that their active-site regions are not naturally as hardened against such collateral damage as they could be, leaving room for improvement by rational design or directed evolution. Enzyme life span might also be improved by engineering systems that repair otherwise fatal active-site damage, of which a handful are known and more are inferred to exist. Unfortunately, the data needed to design and execute such improvements are lacking: there are too few measurements of in vivo life span, and existing information about the extent, nature, and mechanisms of active-site damage and repair during normal enzyme operation is too scarce, anecdotal, and speculative to act on. Fortunately, advances in proteomics, metabolomics, cheminformatics, comparative genomics, and structural biochemistry now empower a systematic, data-driven approach for identifying, predicting, and validating instances of active-site damage and its repair. These capabilities would be practically useful in enzyme redesign and improvement of in-use stability and could change our thinking about which enzymes die young in vivo, and why.

This trait is thought to contribute to the ability ofE. faeciumto spread among patients in hospitals. There is currently a lack of data on the mechanisms that are responsible for the ability ofE. faeciumto survive in the absence of nutrients. Results We performed a high-throughput transposon mutant library screening (Tn-seq) to identify genes that have a role in long-term survival during incubation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 20 degrees C. A total of 24 genes were identified by Tn-seq to contribute to survival in PBS, with functions associated with the general stress response, DNA repair, metabolism, and membrane homeostasis. The gene which was quantitatively most important for survival in PBS wasusp(locus tag: EfmE745_02439), which is predicted to encode a 17.4 kDa universal stress protein. After generating a targeted deletion mutant inusp, we were able to confirm thatuspsignificantly contributes to survival in PBS and this defect was restored byin transcomplementation. Theuspgene is present in 99% of a set of 1644E. faeciumgenomes that collectively span the diversity of the species. Conclusions We postulate thatuspis a key determinant for the remarkable environmental robustness ofE. faecium. Further mechanistic studies intouspand other genes identified in this study may shed further light on the mechanisms by whichE. faeciumcan survive in the absence of nutrients for prolonged periods of time.

Once thought to be a passive transporter of genetic information, RNA has recently emerged as a key player in nearly every pathway in the cell. A full description of its structure is critical to understanding RNA function. Decades of research have focused on utilizing chemical tools to interrogate the structures of RNAs, with recent focus shifting to performing experiments inside living cells. This Review will detail the design and utility of chemical reagents used in RNA structure probing. We also outline how these reagents have been used to gain a deeper understanding of RNA structure in vivo. We review the recent merger of chemical probing with deep sequencing. Finally, we outline some of the hurdles that remain in fully characterizing the structure of RNA inside living cells, and how chemical biology can uniquely tackle such challenges.

These activities can be implemented in different forms, ranging from physical activities to sitting meditation practices. Considering that both such activities are thought to affect children's psychophysical development, a movement-based meditation that combines the two approaches in the form of a short daily activity could represent a powerful tool to promote healthy physical and mental development. Consequently, the current pilot study aimed to examine the effect of short daily school-based sitting and movement meditation trainings on creativity and spatial cognition. Utilizing a crossover design, we evaluated their feasibility and efficacy at different ages among children (n = 50) in 5th to 8th grade. We observed that 5 weeks of daily training in sitting and movement meditation techniques improved children's cognition differently. Specifically, younger children showed greater creativity and better spatial cognition following the movement-based meditation, while older children showed greater enhancement in these areas following sitting meditation training. This suggests that training can affect children's cognition differently depending on their developmental stage. We discuss these results within the framework of embodied and grounded cognition theories. Information on feasibility and age-related effect sizes derived from the current study paves the way for future well-powered larger-scale efficacy studies on different forms of school-based interventions to cognitive development promotion.

DESIGN: Mixed-methods, descriptive correlational study. SAMPLE AND SETTING: The study sample comprised 80 patients with an ostomy receiving treatment and care in a university hospital in Turkey. METHODS: Data were collected using a form developed by the researchers based on literature review. The survey consisted of statements that examined demographic characteristics, experiences, and opinions of patients with an ostomy. RESULTS: For participants, 64.8% (n = 35/54) defined privacy from a physical dimension, 64.1% (n = 25/39) suffered from ostomy-related psychosocial discomfort, 48.7% experienced ostomy-related discomfort mostly during nursing care (n = 19/39), 48.7% (n = 39/80) were uncomfortable when their ostomy was seen by others, Approximately 56.3% (n = 45/80) thought that they disturbed other patients and their families during ostomy care, and 46.3% (n = 37/80) stated that healthcare professionals discussed information about their ostomy when other patients and their families were present. In addition, 21.3% (n = 17/80) opined that the physical conditions of patient rooms failed to provide privacy. Analysis revealed no significant relationship between education levels and reading the Patient Rights Regulation (P = .129). Analysis also found no significant relationships between age (P = .086), marital status (P = .382), educational background (P = .143), hospitalization experience (P = .427), and satisfaction with perceptions of privacy when receiving ostomy care. CONCLUSION: Patients with an ostomy reported physical and psychosocial problems concerning privacy, felt uncomfortable about the way information on their ostomy was discussed, and thought that physical conditions were not suitable for ostomy care. We recommend that healthcare professionals be provided with more training on psychosocial problems and privacy for patients with ostomy and that institutional policies and procedures be developed to address patients' problems.

Without the coil geometry information, making a 3D model of the RF coil may be necessary to simulate the RF coil performance using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) solver. We used a stylus-type 3D tracker to measure the 3D positions of the landmarks on the coil wires. From the measured landmark positions, we built 3D models of the coil wires using a 3D design tool. We also carried out FDTD simulation of the RF coil performances after transferring the 3D model data to the FDTD solver. For demonstration, we built 3D models of a shoulder coil and a 36-channel helmet-style array coil, and we computed B-1 field maps of the coils using the FDTD solver. We think the proposed method can be greatly used for FDTD simulation of the RF coils in use whose geometries are unknown. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Xu, J; Liu, HR; Han, QH				Xu, Jie; Liu, Haoran; Han, Qinghua			Blockchain technology and smart contract for civil structural health monitoring system	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL MODAL-ANALYSIS; WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK; CRACK DETECTION; MODEL; IDENTIFICATION; ALGORITHM; INTERNET; WAVELET; DAMAGE	The rapid development of blockchain technology is exerting a profound impact on all walks of life. Blockchain, which is a decentralized and distributed technology architecture, has inspired people to think about the social development model. However, blockchain technology has not been applied to health monitoring. Therefore, this study proposes a distributed health monitoring system based on blockchain technology, which realizes data security, information transparency, efficient sharing, and independent decision making with smart contracts. First, the system is designed as a blockchain network for structural health monitoring (SHM), and a series of smart contracts for health monitoring is developed to achieve monitoring authority verification, structural damage identification, and other functions. Based on the strength of the Ethereum private chain and Guangzhou New TV Tower benchmark model, smart contracts for health monitoring were deployed, and a series of tests of the proposed system were performed. The results indicate that the proposed system can provide monitoring authority verification, generate abnormal alerts, immutability of data, attack resistance, and traceability query.

MAO-A inhibitors are thought to be effective therapeutic agents for treating neurological diseases including depression and anxiety. Due to the academic challenge of developing new human (h) MAO-A inhibitors and the potential for discovering substances with remarkable properties compared to existing MAO-A inhibitors, numerous research groups are looking into novel classes of chemical compounds that may function as selective hMAO-A inhibitors. beta-Carbolines are reported to be a prominent class of bioactive molecules exhibiting MAO-A inhibition. Chemically, beta-carboline is a tricyclic pyrido-3,4-indole ring. It has only recently been discovered that this chemotype has highly effective and specific MAO-A inhibitory activity. In this review, structure-activity relationship studies included in particular research publications from the 1960s to the present are discussed with regard to beta-carboline and its analogs. This comprehensive information helps to design and develop a new family of MAO-A inhibitors for the management of depressive disorders.

Technology has been harnessed to standardize recording and provide automatic nutritional analysis to reduce cost and researcher burden. Objective: To better assess the diet of young adults, especially relating to the contribution of foods prepared outside the home, a database was needed to support a mobile phone data collection app. The app also required usability testing to assure ease of entry of foods and beverages. This paper describes the development of the Eat and Track app (EaT app) and the database underpinning it. Methods: The Australian Food and Nutrient Database 2011-13, consisting of 5740 food items was modified. Four steps were undertaken: (1) foods not consumed by young adults were removed, (2) nutritionally similar foods were merged, (3) foods available from the 30 largest ready-to-eat food chains in Australia were added, and (4) long generic food names were shortened and simplified. This database was used to underpin the EaT app. Qualitative, iterative usability testing of the EaT app was conducted in three phases using the "Think Aloud" method. Responses were sorted and coded using content analysis. The System Usability Scale (SUS) was administered to measure the EaT app's perceived usability. Results: In total, 1694 (29.51%) foods were removed from the Australian Food and Nutrient Database, including 608 (35.89%) ingredients, 81 (4.78%) foods already captured in the fast food chain information, 52 (3.07%) indigenous foods, 25 (1.48%) nutrients/dietary supplements, and 16 (0.94%) child-specific foods. The remaining 912 (53.84%) foods removed were not consumed by young adults in previous surveys or were "not defined" in the Australian Food and Nutrient Database. Another 220 (3.83%) nutritionally similar foods were combined. The final database consisted of 6274 foods. Fifteen participants completed usability testing. Issues identified by participants fell under six themes: keywords for searching, history list of entered foods, amounts and units, the keypad, food names, and search function. Suggestions for improvement were collected, incorporated, and tested in each iteration of the app. The SUS of the final version of the EaT app was rated 69. Conclusions: A food and beverage database has been developed to underpin the EaT app, enabling data collection on the eating-out habits of 18- to 30-year-old Australians. The development process has resulted in a database with commonly used food names, extensive coverage of foods from ready-to-eat chains, and commonly eaten portion sizes. Feedback from app usability testing led to enhanced keyword searching and the addition of functions to enhance usability such as adding brief instructional screens. There is potential for the features of the EaT app to facilitate the collection of more accurate dietary intake data. The database and the app will be valuable dietary assessment resources for researchers.

Tversky. D. Kahneman, The framing of decisions and the psychology of choice, Science 211 (4481) (1981) 453-458.], refers to the phenomenon that varying the presentations of the same problem can systematically affect the choice one makes. In this research we have reviewed a literature related to the framing effect and neurobiological studies of emotion. This review leads us to conceptualize that framing may induce emotion, which in turn impinges on the level of cognitive effort that subsequently shapes the framing effect. We then employ the eye-tracking technology to explore the differences in cognitive effort under both positive and negative framing conditions. Among the four experimental problems, disease and gambling problems are found to exhibit the framing effect, while the kittens' therapy and the plant problem do not. In analyzing the level of eye movement for the four problems. we find that cognitive effort asymmetry plays a critical role in the production of the framing effect. That is, for the two problems that display the framing effect, subjects expend more effort in the negative framing condition than they do in the positive, yet the framing effect persists, indicating that they cannot change their cognitive inertia despite this increase in cognitive effort. The finding has potential implications for the design of information presentation to facilitate decision making. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Yet the functional properties of multiferroics are thought to be affected detrimentally by the presence of point defects, which may be abundant due to the volatile nature of some constituent atoms and the high temperatures involved in the synthesis of materials. Here, we demonstrate with theoretical methods that oxygen vacancies may enhance the functionality of multiferroics by radically changing their magnetic interactions in thin films. Specifically, oxygen vacancies may restore missing magnetic super-exchange interactions in large axial ratio phases, leading to full antiferromagnetic spin ordering, and induce the stabilization of ferrimagnetic states with considerable net magnetizations. Our theoretical study should help to clarify the origins of long-standing controversies in bismuth ferrite and improve the design of technological applications based on multiferroics.

The study of institutions in several social science fields has provided many important insights that have not been fully appreciated in the evolutionary human sciences. However, such research has often lacked a shared understanding of general processes of change that shape institutional diversity across space and time. We argue that evolutionary theory can provide a useful framework for synthesizing information from different disciplines to address issues such as how and why institutions change over time, how institutional rules co-evolve with other culturally inherited traits, and the role that ecological factors might play in shaping institutional diversity. We argue that we can gain important insights by applying cultural evolutionary thinking to the study of institutions, but that we also need to expand and adapt our approaches to better handle the ways that institutions work, and how they might change over time. In this paper, we illustrate our approach by describing macro-scale empirical comparative analyses that demonstrate how evolutionary theory can be used to generate and test hypotheses about the processes that have shaped some of the major patterns we see in institutional diversity over time and across the world today. We then go on to discuss how we might usefully develop micro-scale models of institutional change by adapting concepts from game theory and agent-based modelling. We end by considering current challenges and areas for future research, and the potential implications for other areas of study and real-world applications.

Student health professionals' attitudes and experience after watching "Ida's Diary", a first-person account of living with borderline personality disorder: Mixed methods study	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Article						Borderline personality disorder; Emotionally unstable personality disorder; Nursing; Attitudes; Education; Film; Mixed methods; Cinenurducation	NURSES	Background: There is increasing interest in the use of commercial movies in nursing education, or "cine-nurducation". There is a need for educational interventions which target mental health nurses' attitudes towards people with borderline personality disorder. Objectives: To investigate and evaluate the experience and effects of attendance at a screening of the movie Ida's Diary, a first-person account of living with borderline personality disorder. Design: Mixed methods design comprising a within-subjects AB longitudinal survey, and a qualitative analysis of participant-generated data and researcher field notes from a World Cafe discussion group. Settings: One university in Scotland. Participants: N = 66 undergraduate and postgraduate mental health nursing and counselling students. Methods: Participants completed measures of cognitive and emotional attitudes towards, and knowledge about, people with borderline personality disorder before and after one of two film screenings. We conducted a World Cafe discussion group after the second screening. Resulting data were subject to a qualitative thematic analysis. Results: Quantitative analysis revealed a five-factor cognitive and a single-factor emotional attitude structure. Cognitive-attitudinal items related to treatment deservingness and value of mixed treatment approaches improved across iterations. Total knowledge score did not change, but one item about borderline personality disorder as a precursor to schizophrenia received considerably more incorrect endorsement post-screening. Qualitative analysis revealed five themes: Facilitation and inhibition of learning, promotion but not satiation of appetite for knowledge; challenging existing understanding, prompting creativity and anxiety; and initiating thinking about the bigger picture. Conclusions: Participants found the film thought provoking; it increased their appetite for knowledge. Findings suggest that screening should be delivered in conjunction with more didactic information about borderline personality disorder.

J	Kim, S; Hong, S				Kim, Seunghwi; Hong, Seonki			Nature-Inspired Adhesive Catecholamines for Highly Concentrated Colorimetric Signal in Spatial Biomarker Labeling	ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS			English	Article						adhesive colorant; catecholamine; colorimetric bioassays; molecular probe; organic colorant	ASSAY; COATINGS	Colorants have been utilized for precise biomarker detection in rapid and convenient colorimetric bioassays. However, the diffusion of colorants in solution often results in poor sensitivity, which is a major obstacle to the clinical translation of current colorants. To address this issue, in the current study, a unique colorant is developed that possesses adhesiveness for concentration near the target biomarker, avoiding diffusion. In nature, the synergistic interplay between catechol and amine functional groups is thought to be key for the unique mechanism of marine mussel adhesion. In addition, polymerized catecholamines are found in nature as biopigments, that is, in melanin. The dual role of catechol/catecholamine moieties in natural organics inspire to design novel colorimetric bioassays based on an adhesive colorant. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is used to initiate in situ polymerization of the catecholic precursors with amine-containing additive molecules and simultaneously attach them near the HRP-labeled biomarkers. This novel catecholamine-based adhesive colorant provides an excellent quantitative (naked-eye) visible signal and it also generates superb spatial information on the biomarkers on complex surfaces (e.g., cell membranes).

ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE			English	Review						Environmental governance; Environmental impacts; Fisheries; Forests; Rangelands; Natural resources management; Property rights; Tenure	MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; SOLOMON-ISLANDS; SOUTH-AFRICA; REEF FISHES; COMMUNITY; MANAGEMENT; TENURE; CONSERVATION; DEGRADATION; RESILIENCE	Background: Property rights to natural resources comprise a major policy instrument in efforts to advance sustainable resource use and conservation. Debate over the relative effectiveness of different property rights regimes in reaching these goals remains controversial. A large, diverse, and rapidly growing body of literature investigates the links between property rights regimes and environmental outcomes, but has not synthesized theoretical and policy insights within specific resource systems and especially across resource systems. Methods: We conducted a systematic review following CEE Guidelines in which we collected empirical evidence from the past two decades on the environmental impacts of property rights regimes in fisheries, forests and range-lands in developing countries. We used a bundle of rights approach to assess the impacts of state, private, and community property regimes, as well as mixed regimes and open access conditions. Outcomes were classified as positive, negative, neutral or undetermined. We also collected information on contextual and other factors thought to influence effect of property rights regimes on environmental outcomes. The search covered 90 online databases and three languages, resulting in a total of 34,984 screened titles. Results: This review identified 103 articles consisting of 374 property regime studies: 55% of the studies related to forestry, 31% to fisheries, and 14% to rangelands. The majority of the studies comprised case-control studies but presented limited information on the baseline condition of the resource system. Only 26 studies used before-after-control-impact (BACI) design. We found that property regime comparisons differed across resource domains with, for example, the majority of fisheries studies using comparison to an open access situation while forest and rangeland studies were more mixed in regime comparisons. After critical appraisal of included studies, only 80 studies were accepted for the narrative synthesis. The key contextual factors largely associated with reported positive environmental outcomes across the three resource systems included monitoring and enforcement systems, resource use pressure, and the presence or absence of clear, stable and legitimate rights (i.e. 'positive regime characteristics'). Conclusions: A key overall finding was that the evidence base was insufficiently robust to draw consistent conclusions about the environmental impacts of different property rights regimes within or across resource systems. The majority of studies reported that any regime is likely to perform better than an open access regime, whereas the performance of state, community, private and mixed regimes was much more ambiguous. Future research on property rights regimes would benefit from more rigorous study designs and more cohesive multidisciplinary research methods. In particular, studies emphasizing a natural science approach could better describe property rights regime characteristics and contextual factors while contributions by teams with a stronger social science emphasis should take care to provide more rigorous empirical data on environmental outcomes.

J	Kawaguchi, M; Nakajima, Y; Nakagawa, H				Kawaguchi, Mitsuyasu; Nakajima, Yuya; Nakagawa, Hidehiko			Development of Sirtuin Fluorescence Probes and Medicinal Chemistry Research Targeting SIRT Family	JOURNAL OF SYNTHETIC ORGANIC CHEMISTRY JAPAN			Japanese	Article						sirtuin; fluorescence probe; fluorescence imaging; inhibitor; chemical screening; defatty-acylase	DEACETYLASE; MECHANISM; INHIBITORS; ACTIVATION; PHYSIOLOGY; DISCOVERY; POTENT; SWITCH	Sirtuins (SIRTs) are a family of NAD-dependent histone deacetylases. In mammals, dysfunction of SIRTs is associated with age-related metabolic diseases and cancers, so SIRT modulators are considered to have potential therapeutic values. For a long time, it was thought that SIRTs only catalyze deacetylation reactions of histones, however, more recently, it was found that SIRTs can remove various acyl groups, including propionyl, crotonyl, succinyl, hexanoyl, myristoyl, palmitoyl, lipoyl and benzoyl groups, from histones and many other protein substrates. In addition, recent reports suggest that SIRT6 demyristoylase activity regulates the secretion of TNF-alpha, and that SIRT2 defatty acylase activity regulates the localization of K-Ras4a oncoprotein and promotes cellular transformation, meaning that new enzymatic activities of SIRTs also regulate pathophysiological functions. Therefore, SIRT-subtype- and activity-specific fluorescence probes and modulators are required both as tools for basic research to understand the physiological functions of SIRTs and as candidate therapeutic agents. In this review article, we first describe the molecular design and development of a new fluorescent probe for one-step SIRT activity detection and their application to cellular SIRT1 imaging. We then outline a strategy for converting fluorescent probes to peptide inhibitors based on the findings obtained in the course of developing the fluorescent probes. We further describe the construction of a fluorescent probe library with different isozyme selectivity among SIRTs was used to select the best fluorescent probe for detecting SIRT2 activity, which was then applied to chemical screening to search for small-molecular inhibitors of SIRT2 demyristoylase activity.

Video is becoming a dominant and pervasive medium, and online video a growing entertainment activity on the web and iTV, mainly due to technological developments and the trends for media convergence. In addition, the improvement of new techniques for gathering emotional information about videos, both through content analysis or user implicit feedback through user physiological signals complemented in manual labeling from users, is revealing new ways for exploring emotional information in videos, films or TV series, and brings out new perspectives to enrich and personalize video access. In this work, we reflect on the power that emotions have in our lives, on the emotional impact of movies, and on how to address this emotional dimension in the way we classify and access movies, by exploring and evaluating the design of iFelt in its different ways to classify, access, browse and visualize movies based on their emotional impact.

Various mediators of inflammation have been detected in human tendons: they are thought to initiate or progress the course of tendinopathy. Sources of data: An online search was conducted using AMED, CINAHL, Embase, The Cochrane Library, PEDro and Pubmed, using the terms tendinopathy, tendon, tendinitis, tendinosis, histology, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, immunohistochemical, rotator cuff and pain. Areas of agreement: Histological examination of tendinopathic tendons shows degeneration of the collagen structure and infiltration of fat and vessels, together with increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, MMP-1, 2, 3, 9, 13, vascular endothelial growth factor and Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). Areas of controversy: Most of the studies about this topic exhibited limited validity because of lack of appropriately matched controls and no inclusion or exclusion criteria. The evidence associated with the histopathological analysis of the rotator cuff is limited. Growing points: The histochemical and immunohistochemical features of rotator cuff tendinopathy are still unclear. A thorough understanding of the vascularity, innervation and biochemical mediators of pain could be used to target rotator cuff pathology, and possibly guide the therapy of painful rotator cuff disorders. Areas timely for developing research: There is a need for a validated reproducible method of rotator cuff tendon biopsy evaluation. We require further studies with improved designs to effectively evaluate the histological and immunohistochemical features of rotator cuff tendinopathy.

However, in the technology-enhanced learning environments, which are also full of social networking websites, shopping websites, and free online games, it is challenging to focus students' attention and help them achieve satisfactory learning performance. In addition, the instruction of programming courses constantly challenges both teachers and students, particularly in online learning environments. To overcome and solve these problems and to facilitate students' learning, the researchers in this study integrated two teaching approaches, using meta-cognitive learning strategy (MCLS) and team regulation (TR), to develop students' regular learning habits and further contribute to their programming skills, academic motivation, and refusal self-efficacy of Internet use, in a cloud classroom. In this research, a quasi-experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of MCLS and TR adopting the experimental design of a 2 (MCLS vs. non-MCLS)x2 (TR vs. non-TR) factorial pre-test/post-test. In this research, the participants consisted of four classes of university students from non-information or computer departments enrolled in programming design, a required course. The experimental groups comprised three of the classes, labelled as G1, G2, and G3. G1 concurrently received both the online MCLS and TR intervention, while G2 only received the online MCLS intervention, and G3 only received the online TR intervention. Serving as the control group, the fourth class (G4) received traditional teaching. This study investigated the effects of MCLS, TR, and their combination, on improving students' programming skills, academic motivation, and refusal self-efficacy of Internet use in an online computing course. According to the results, students who received online TR significantly enhanced their programming design skills and their refusal self-efficacy of Internet use a cloud classroom. However, the expected effects of MCLS on developing students' programming skills, academic motivation, and refusal self-efficacy of Internet use were not found in this study. The teaching strategy of integrating MCLS and TR in an online programming course in this study can serve as a reference for educators when conducting online, blended, or flipped courses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

J	Hafaifa, A; Laaouad, F; Laroussi, K				Hafaifa, Ahmed; Laaouad, Ferhat; Laroussi, Kouider			A Numerical Structural Approach to Surge Detection and Isolation in Compression Systems Using Fuzzy Logic Controller	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL AUTOMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Compression system; fuzzy control; modelling; surge control; Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model	AXIAL-FLOW COMPRESSORS; CENTRIFUGAL-COMPRESSOR; ROTATING STALL; FAULT-DETECTION	Fuzzy control is a practical alternative for a variety of challenging control applications since it provides a convenient method for constructing nonlinear controllers via the use of heuristic information. This approach provides a formal methodology for representing, manipulating, and implementing a human's heuristic knowledge about how to modeled and to control a system. This paper focuses on the application of fuzzy control approach to the surge phenomena in centrifugal compression system. Fuzzy controller is designed to consist of an active surge control and phase control without any explicit system models, but driven in the human thinking mechanism. This fuzzy control methodology suggested in this work reproduced well the main characteristics of the turbo compressor dynamic model developed by Moore and Gretzer and give place to a more precise and easy to handle representation. Application and simulation results are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this controller. Studies show that, the proposed controller provides good tracking control performance for the compression system at different operating conditions and moreover improves the dynamic performances of the system.

Web-based Assessment of Social-Emotional Skills in School-Aged Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder	AUTISM RESEARCH			English	Article						autism; assessment; emotion recognition; theory of mind; social problem solving; self-control	CHILDREN; RECOGNITION; MIND; INDIVIDUALS; COGNITION; ABILITIES; PROFILES; RATINGS	Few tools are available to comprehensively describe the unique social-emotional skill profiles of youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study describes the usability, reliability, and validity of SELweb, a normed, web-based assessment designed to measure four core social-emotional domains, when used to measure these skills in a sample of 57 well-characterized youth with ASD (ages 6-10 years with IQ >= 80). SELweb measures facial emotion recognition, theory of mind, social problem solving, and self-control. SELweb was well tolerated and yielded scores with reliabilities comparable to those found in normative samples. SELweb scores showed good evidence of convergent and discriminant validity for three of the four skills it was designed to assess. Mean deficits were found for theory of mind, social problem solving, and self-control, whereas no mean deficits were found for emotion recognition. Individual profiles varied considerably, suggesting the sensitivity of SELweb to the within- and between-person individual differences among youth with ASD. Findings support the usefulness and accessibility of SELweb as a tool for measuring complex social-emotional skill profiles in youth with ASD. Autism Res 2019, 12: 1260-1271. (c) 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary No single, simple, high-quality test exists that measures multiple social thinking skills directly in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study suggests that SELweb, a web-based assessment system, is an effective and valid way to measure how children with ASD think about and understand social and emotional information, and is able to capture strengths and weaknesses experienced by children with ASD.

A multi-speaker playback experiment	BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							VOCAL INTERACTIONS; INFORMATION; ADVERTISEMENT; DISTANCE	Within a network of communicating individuals, animals may gather information about the relative quality of conspecifics by eavesdropping on their signalling interactions. For territorial male songbirds, eavesdropping may be a low-cost, low-risk method for assessing the relative quality of the males around them. We used a three-speaker playback design to evaluate whether male black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) respond differently to two simulated countersinging intruders who differ only in relative features of their singing performance. We arranged three loudspeakers in an equilateral triangle at the center of playback subjects' territories. After luring males to the first loudspeaker by broadcasting non-song vocalizations, we played songs from the remaining loudspeakers to simulate a countersinging interaction between two male intruders. During the interactions, one simulated intruder consistently overlapped the songs of the other, a behaviour thought to be a signal of directed aggression in songbirds. Territorial male chickadees discriminated between the simulated intruders by preferentially approaching the loudspeaker broadcasting the overlapping signal, suggesting that males eavesdrop on other males' countersinging interactions. Male responses to playback support the idea that overlapping is a more threatening signal than being overlapped. Responses varied with the dominance status of the subject. High-ranking males approached the overlapping loudspeaker in 15 of 16 cases whereas low-ranking males approached the overlapping speaker in only 5 of 10 cases, suggesting that males of different quality may use different tactics for territorial defense.

Providing information about the monsoon onset for the past, present, and future has potential benefit for a country so vulnerable to changes in climate. But, when does the monsoon start? To produce any scientific information about monsoon onsets, lengths, and withdrawals, we first need to apply a monsoon definition to our data. Choosing a scientific definition is not such a simple exercise in Bangladesh. Different definitions lead to different monsoon onsets and thereby also monsoon lengths. If a climate application aims to provide information about the monsoon onset, then we need to understand how the people who might use this information perceive the monsoon onset. We then need to understand how their perceptions compare with previous scientific work. In this study we carried out a structured questionnaire in six rural regions around Bangladesh and asked the local agriculturists how they defined the monsoon and when they thought it started. It turns out that the agriculturists and previous scientific publications do not necessarily agree. Our results do not undermine previous scientific work on the monsoon in Bangladesh, but they do carry an important message about how we should design, implement, and evaluate climate applications in Bangladesh that encompass the monsoon onset.

Previous studies have evaluated the association between TNFA gene polymorphisms and H. pylori infection, but the results were inconclusive. We conducted this meta-analysis to clarify the association between TNFA polymorphisms and H. pylori infection. Methods Published literature within PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were used in our meta-analysis. Data were analyzed with the Stata13.1 software package using pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results A total of 24 studies were included in our study. The TNFA-308G> A polymorphism was associated with decreasing H. pylori infection (AA vs. AG+GG, OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.43-0.97; AA vs. GG,OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.43-0.97). A significantly decreased risk was also found for -1031T>C polymorphism (CC vs. CT+TT, OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.44-0.84). -863C>A polymorphism was associated with increasing risk of H. pylori infection (AA+AC vs. CC, OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.16-1.86; A allele vs. C allele, OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.14-1.72). There was no significant association between -857C>T polymorphism and H. pylori infection. When stratified analysis was conducted on H. pylori infection detection methods, -857C>T and -863C>A polymorphisms were associated with H. pylori infection for the non-ELISA subgroup. When stratified for ethnicity or study design, -863C>A significantly increased the risk and -1031T>C decreased the risk for the Asian subgroup and hospital-based subgroup. Conclusion Results of our meta-analysis demonstrate that TNFA -308G>A and -1031T>C polymor-phisms may be protective factors against H. pylori infection, and -863C>A may be a risk factor, especially in Asian populations. Further studies with larger sample sizes are required to validate these results.

Student nurses begin the construction of their nursing identity during their clinical placements. Aim: The aim of this research was to examine how the student nurses of a regional Australian university construct their identity when on off-campus clinical placement. Methods/ Design: Using a constructivist approach an online survey was used to elicit data in response to the question What elements are needed during the work integrated learning experience to enable undergraduate nursing students to construct their nursing identity?' Results/Findings: Findings reveal five key elements to the construction of students' nursing identity; positive role models, belonging, peer support, critical thinking abilities and confidence. Conclusion: Such findings are important as they provide information for student nurses, preceptors and educators in guiding clinical placement experiences that are able to facilitate the development of the nursing identity.

A mixed methods study	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						MEDICAL ETHICS; Information management; HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION & MANAGEMENT; Health policy; Protocols & guidelines; Patient-Centered Care	DISCLOSURE; VIEWS	Objective To understand: if professionals, citizens and patients can locate UK healthcare professionals' statements of declarations of interests, and what citizens understand by these. Design The study sample included two groups of participants in three phases. First, healthcare professionals working in the public domain (health professional participants, HPP) were invited to participate. Their conflicts and declarations of interest were searched for in publicly available data, which the HPP checked and confirmed as the 'gold standard'. In the second phase, laypeople, other healthcare professionals and healthcare students were invited to complete three online tasks. The first task was a questionnaire about their own demographics. The second task was questions about doctors' conflicts of interest in clinical vignette scenarios. The third task was a request for each participant to locate and describe the declarations of interest of one of the named healthcare professionals identified in the first phase, randomly assigned. At the end of this task, all lay participants were asked to indicate willingness to be interviewed at a later date. In the third phase, each lay respondent who was willing to be contacted was invited to a qualitative interview to obtain their views on the conflicts and declaration of interest they found and their meaning. Setting Online, based in the UK. Participants 13 public-facing health professionals, 379 participants (healthcare professionals, students and laypeople), 21 lay interviewees. Outcome measures (1) Participants' level of trust in professionals with variable conflicts of interest, as expressed in vignettes, (2) participants' ability to locate the declarations of interest of a given well-known healthcare professional and (3) laypeoples' understanding of healthcare professionals declarations and conflicts of interest. Results In the first phase, 13 health professionals (HPP) participated and agreed on a 'gold standard' of their declarations. In the second phase, 379 citizens, patients, other healthcare professionals and students participated. Not all completed all aspects of the research. 85% of participants thought that knowing about professional declarations was definitely or probably important, but 76.8% were not confident they had found all relevant information after searching. As conflicts of interest increased in the vignettes, participants trusted doctors less. Least trust was associated with doctors who had not disclosed their conflicts of interest. 297 participants agreed to search for the HPP 'gold standard' declaration of interest, and 169 reported some data. Of those reporting any findings, 61 (36%) located a relevant link to some information deemed fit for purpose, and 5 (3%) participants found all the information contained in the 'gold standard'. In the third phase, qualitative interviews with 21 participants highlighted the importance of transparency but raised serious concerns about how useful declarations were in their current format, and whether they could improve patient care. Unintended consequences, such as the burden for patients and professionals to use declarations were identified, with participants additionally expressing concerns about professional bias and a lack of insight over conflicts. Suggestions for improvements included better regulation and organisation, but also second opinions and independent advice where conflicts of interest were suspected. Conclusion Declarations of interest are important and conflicts of interest concern patients and professionals, particularly in regard to trust in decision-making. If declarations, as currently made, are intended to improve transparency, they do not achieve this, due to difficulties in locating and interpreting them. Unintended consequences may arise if transparency alone is assumed to provide management of conflicts. Increased trust resulting from transparency may be misplaced, given the evidence on the hazards associated with conflicts of interest. Clarity about the purposes of transparency is required. Future policies may be more successful if focused on reducing the potential for negative impacts of conflicts of interest, rather than relying on individuals to locate declarations and interpret them.

Coordinated neuronal ensembles in primary auditory cortical columns	ELIFE			English	Article							PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; CELL ASSEMBLIES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RECEPTIVE-FIELD; POPULATION RESPONSES; ORDER INTERACTIONS; MULTIPLE LEVELS; PATTERNS; ORGANIZATION; CONNECTIVITY	The synchronous activity of groups of neurons is increasingly thought to be important in cortical information processing and transmission. However, most studies of processing in the primary auditory cortex (Al) have viewed neurons as independent filters; little is known about how coordinated Al neuronal activity is expressed throughout cortical columns and how it might enhance the processing of auditory information. To address this, we recorded from populations of neurons in Al cortical columns of anesthetized rats and, using dimensionality reduction techniques, identified multiple coordinated neuronal ensembles (cNEs), which are groups of neurons with reliable synchronous activity. We show that cNEs reflect local network configurations with enhanced information encoding properties that cannot be accounted for by stimulus-driven synchronization alone. Furthermore, similar cNEs were identified in both spontaneous and evoked activity, indicating that columnar cNEs are stable functional constructs that may represent principal units of information processing in Al.

Some Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) treatments have evidence of effectiveness for symptom relief and could be used instead of antibiotics. Aim: To understand views of the general public and health professionals regarding use of CAM for uncomplicated ARIs. Design and Setting: Systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies. Method: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, COREHOM, CINAHL, Dissertation and theses global and Web of Science Core Collection. We included studies which reported qualitative data on the use of CAM for uncomplicated ARIs where participants were either patients or parents of patients, health professionals or the general public. Analysis followed thematic synthesis. Results: Twenty-two studies were included from four high-income and ten low-and-middle income countries; almost all focussed on non-White populations. Nineteen concerned parents' treatment of ARIs in their children. In all settings, treatment decisions were influenced by beliefs about the illness (cause, severity), beliefs about treatments (efficacy, safety), availability of treatments and of trustworthy advice. Participants mostly thought CAM is an acceptable option for treatment of mild ARIs but felt that they need trustworthy advice on which treatments to use and when. Conclusion: Treatment decisions depend on beliefs about the illness and treatments, availability of treatments and advice. CAM treatments appear to be acceptable to people from many different settings as a possible alternative to antibiotics for mild ARIs. There is a need for reliable, evidence-based advice on which treatments to use.

J	Cowdell, F				Cowdell, Fiona			Knowledge mobilisation: an exploratory qualitative interview study to confirm and envision modification of lay and practitioner eczema mindlines to improve consultation experiences and self-management in primary care in the UK	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							INFORMATION-SEEKING; CHILDHOOD ECZEMA; SKIN-DISEASE; PEOPLE; GUIDELINES; FUTURE	Objectives To investigate whether initial eczema mindlines, 'collectively reinforced, internalised, tacit guidelines', are an accurate representation of the experiences of lay people and practitioners in primary care and to explore how these mindlines may best be revised to improve eczema care. Design Exploratory qualitative interviews with constant comparative analysis and data mining. Setting UK, primary care. Participants People with eczema or parents of children with eczema (n=19) and primary care practitioners (n=13). Results Interview data were analysed using constant comparison of new data with existing initial eczema rnindlines to identify areas of agreement and disagreement. Data were mined for participant's thoughts about whose mindlines should be modified, how this may be achieved and what core content is essential. Eczema mindlines and the spiral of knowledge creation, from which they evolved, intuitively made sense. Participants offered examples of how their eczema knowledge is continually produced and transformed as they interact with others. They reported diverse and wide-ranging influences on their thinking and recognised the critical relationship between lay and practitioner mindlines. For this reason they advocated modifying lay and practitioner mindlines in parallel. Participants advised amendment based on consistent information directed to all who influence eczema care. Information should come from trusted sources and be easy to access, distilled, practical, contextually relevant and amenable to assimilation. Conclusions The purpose here is to improve primary care consultation experiences and self-management in eczema. The remaining challenge is to find novel, simple and pragmatic methods of modifying eczema mindlines to instil shared and consistent understanding. Given the prevalence of eczema and the scope of people who influence self-care, interventions should transcend patient practitioner boundaries and address the wider community. One conceptually congruent approach is to create a Ba, which in this case would be a virtual space for generating and sharing eczema knowledge.

In the quantitative stage of the study formed according to the explanatory sequential design, the intermediary role of rumination by using a structural equation model while in the qualitative stage, the intermediary role of rumination was analyzed through interviews using the interpretive phenomenology design. Personal Information Form, Childhood Trauma Scale, Short Form Ruminative Response Scale, Acceptance and Action Form II, Drexel Defusion Scale, and Emotion Regulation Scale were used in the research. At the end of the research, it was determined that childhood traumas have a negative effect on cognitive defusion and acceptance, while they have a positive effect on suppression. It was seen that rumination has a partial intermediary role in the relationship of childhood traumas with cognitive defusion, acceptance, and suppression. As a result of the qualitative analysis, twelve themes such as "Constantly thinking about the past, not being able to move away from childhood traumas, not being able to forgive their parents, inability to get rid of negative thoughts, living in the past, moving away from a value-driven life, false expression of emotion, suppression of emotions, emotions reflected in behavior, coping with negative emotions and desired emotion regulation" emerged concerning participants' experiences of cognitive defusion, acceptance, and suppression. Although one of the purposes of using AAQ-II in the study was to support discussions about the scale via qualitative results, this was a limitation for the study. Therefore, although a high rate was obtained, it is not possible to infer that childhood traumas and rumination can explain acceptance behaviors. For this, much more quantitative and qualitative studies are needed. Other qualitative research findings are thought to support quantitative research findings.

The purpose of this study was to explore the specific service needs of adolescents (12-18 years) after a mTBI. Study design: Qualitative phenomenological study. Methods and procedures: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 adolescents and their parents who had received different levels of care from paediatric trauma centres within the previous 12 months. Main outcomes and results: All adolescents and parents expressed the need to receive information about the injury, its expected recovery and when to return to activities. Many adolescents reported wanting to be seen rapidly, by professionals who genuinely care about them and who acknowledge that they have specific needs that differ from those of younger children. Parents and, to a lesser degree, adolescents think that enhanced communication between the healthcare and school systems would be beneficial following a mTBI to assist in returning to demanding academic activities. Conclusions: Professionals involved in the management of adolescents with mTBI should be aware of their needs in order to provide optimal and developmentally appropriate services.

Background: Professionals need to discuss about the heart failure prognosis with patients in order to improve their understanding of their illness and address palliative care needs. Methods: An inductive and exploratory design was used. A total of 24 patients (75% men, 52-87 years of age) in New York Heart Association class I-III from primary outpatient care participated in focus group-, or individual semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was used to identify and interpret patterns in the data. Findings: Two overarching themes, "The message sent" and "Hoping for the best or preparing for the worst", each with three sub-themes, were discovered during the thematic analysis. Many patients described that professionals had not provided them with any prognosis information at all. Other patients described professional information about prognosis that was given in an either very optimistic or very negative way. However, patients also described situations where professionals had given information in a way that they thought was perfect for them to handle, and in accordance with their preferences. Conclusion: This study shows that patients have different experiences and preferences for communication about prognosis and uses different approaches in order to cope living with a chronic illness such as heart failure.

At present, the existing Cold Start RS computes the probability of App launching mainly by mining the potential information of new users and similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering algorithm CF). But for newly installed Apps, the default CF does not have any useful information for App Cold Start recommendation, resulting in the data sparseness. To tackle the problems, we think that App usage periodicity installed by the new user is regularly followed under different conditions. It not only compensates for the data sparseness of similar users but also increases the predictive flexibility when the user's environment changes. Therefore, we designed Predictor, an efficient dynamic CF fusion algorithm that provides App Cold Start prediction for new users on mobile devices. It dynamically combines both App preferences of similar users (user-based CF) and App usage periodicity (item-based CF) through the conditional combination. Compared to other traditional methods, Predictor proposes more appropriate App launching recommendation and matches the launching expectations of most users.

J	Maries, A; Singh, C				Maries, Alexandru; Singh, Chandralekha			Teaching assistants' performance at identifying common introductory student difficulties in mechanics revealed by the Force Concept Inventory	PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH			English	Article							PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE; ITEM RESPONSE CURVES; TEACHERS; PHYSICS; SCIENCE	The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) has been widely used to assess student understanding of introductory mechanics concepts by a variety of educators and physics education researchers. One reason for this extensive use is that many of the items on the FCI have strong distractor choices which correspond to students' alternate conceptions in mechanics. Instruction is unlikely to be effective if instructors do not know the common alternate conceptions of introductory physics students and explicitly take into account students' initial knowledge states in their instructional design. Here, we discuss research involving the FCI to evaluate one aspect of the pedagogical content knowledge of teaching assistants (TAs): knowledge of introductory student alternate conceptions in mechanics as revealed by the FCI. For each item on the FCI, the TAs were asked to identify the most common incorrect answer choice of introductory physics students. This exercise was followed by a class discussion with the TAs related to this task, including the importance of knowing student difficulties in teaching and learning. Then, we used FCI pretest and post-test data from a large population (similar to 900) of introductory physics students to assess the extent to which TAs were able to identify alternate conceptions of introductory students related to force and motion. In addition, we carried out think-aloud interviews with graduate students who had more than two semesters of teaching experience in recitations to examine how they reason about the task. We find that while the TAs, on average, performed better than random guessing at identifying introductory students' difficulties with FCI content, they did not identify many common difficulties that introductory physics students have after traditional instruction. We discuss specific alternate conceptions, the extent to which TAs are able to identify them, and results from the think-aloud interviews that provided valuable information about why TAs sometimes select certain alternate conceptions as the most common, which are instead very rare among introductory students. We also briefly compare the performance of the TAs with physics instructors in identifying common introductory student difficulties with FCI content using the same task and find that their performances are comparable. Furthermore, our data suggest that the ability to identify introductory students' difficulties was not correlated with whether the TAs obtained their undergraduate degree in the U. S. or elsewhere.

Students perceive skills learned in pre-clerkship PBL valuable in core clinical rotations	MEDICAL TEACHER			English	Article						Problem-based; undergraduate; medicine; clinical	MEDICAL-STUDENTS; CONCEPTIONS; PHYSICIAN; OUTCOMES; SCHOOL; COMPETENCES; EXPERIENCE; TRANSITION; UNIVERSITY	Purpose:Problem-based learning (PBL) is an instructional method widely used by medical educators that promotes an environment in which students effectively learn the foundational knowledge and skills that are prerequisites for graduation. This study evaluated medical students' perceptions of the helpfulness of skills acquired in PBL to core clerkship rotations. Methods:A 25-item survey was designed to assess students' perceptions of skills learned in PBL that were helpful on core clerkships and transferable to the clinical setting. A random sample of students with at least 8 months of clerkship experience were invited to complete the survey. Results:Of 68 students, 35 (52%) returned questionnaires. Results suggest a clustering of themes based on their perceived value. Skills learned in PBL that students rated most highly as helpful or very helpful during core clinical rotations include: comfort discussing concepts, identifying key information, presentation skills, interpersonal skills, diagnostic thinking, finding information, self-awareness, and organizing information. Other items rated highly included: forming questions, time management, primary literature (engaging with published original research articles), and leadership. The skills acquired in PBL were associated with multiple competency domains. Conclusions:Although conditions of the pre-clerkship curriculum are substantially different from the learning environment of clerkship rotations, skills learned in PBL are perceived as applicable to authentic clinical training.

Experiences with and Perception of a Web-Based Mindfulness, Nutrition, and Fitness Platform Reported by First-Year University Students: A Qualitative Study	JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS			English	Article						Internet-based intervention; Qualitative research; University students; Diet; Mental health; Exercise	COLLEGE-STUDENTS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; MENTAL-HEALTH; MOBILE APPS; WEIGHT-GAIN; STRESS; BEHAVIORS	Background My Viva Plan (MVP) (https://www.myvivainc.com/) is a web-based application developed by a dietitian that aims to support healthy living by providing resources and self-monitoring tools to help promote a healthy diet, healthy mind, and physical fitness. First-year university students have the potential to benefit because poor dietary choices, limited physical activity, and high stress are prevalent in this population. In addition, they are also active technology users. Objective This study aims to understand experiences and perception of MVP by first year university students using this tool as part of a 12-week randomized controlled trial. Design One-on-one semistructured interviews were conducted following a 12-week intervention involving use of MVP. Participants/setting First-year university students from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada (n 1/4 32). Intervention Participants were instructed to use MVP as much as possible for 12 weeks in either the fall/2018 or winter/2019 semesters. Qualitative data analysis Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed abductively using content analysis. Results Participants reported varied use of MVP across the 12-week period. Data were categorized using the HealthChange Methodology (Behaviors, Emotions, 37 Situations, Thinking) framework. Participants provided various examples of emotions (eg, motivation, stress), situations (eg, time, living arrangements, finances), and thinking (eg, self-awareness, level of satisfaction with MVP, and how MVP was or could be better tailored for students) that acted as either facilitators or barriers to MVP use and explained their behaviors associated with this tool. Conclusions Overall, participant behaviors regarding MVP varied and were influenced by several factors, including their emotions, situations, and thinking. The Behaviors, Emotions, Situations, Thinking framework may be helpful for dietitians to identify barriers and facilitators affecting their client's use of ehealth tools for lifestyle behavior change. This information can be used to optimize client support when using these tools.	[Lieffers, Jessica R.

Modeling complex systems of systems with Phantom System Models	SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						systems of systems; Phantom System Models; state variables; system identification; meta-modeling	EMPIRICAL BAYES	Complex systems are commonly composed of interconnected and inter- and intradependent subsystems, which in their essence constitute systems of systems with multiple functions, operations, and stakeholders. Phantom System Models (PSM) is a modeling methodology inspired by philosophical and conceptual thinking from the arts, and is driven and supported by systems engineering theory, methodology, and practice. The PSM is designed to model inter- and intradependencies between and among the subsystems of a complex system of systems by exploiting vital knowledge and information embedded in the intrinsic and extrinsic common and uncommon state variables among the subsystems. Among the several systems engineering theories and methodologies, the PSM in particular builds on the centrality of the states of the system in modeling and in risk analysis; fundamentals in system identification (the inverse problem); hierarchical holographic modeling; coordinated hierarchical Bayesian model; and hierarchical decomposition and higher-level coordination. An example problem of a PSM-based modeling of a prototype system of systems is presented. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Adapting scientific reasoning instruction to children's needs: effects on learning processes and learning outcomes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION			English	Article						scientific reasoning; adaptivity; primary education	VARIABLES STRATEGY; HYPOTHESIS GENERATION; ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL; THINKING; SCIENCE	Scientific reasoning helps children understand the world around them. Teaching scientific reasoning can be challenging because not all component scientific reasoning skills develop at the same age and not all children learn these skills at the same pace. Adaptive support thus seems called for. We designed two types of adaptive instruction, based on children's standardised test scores (macro-adaptive; n = 58) or their performance in the previous lesson (micro-adaptive; n = 46), and tested their effectiveness against a non-adaptive control condition (n = 49). Analysis of pre- and post-test scores showed comparable improvements in all three instructional conditions. As many children in both adaptive conditions received medium support, additional analyses were done on children in the macro-adaptive condition who received high or low-support worksheets, and their control group counterparts. Learning gains for these groups were similar. Children's overall task performance during the lessons also improved, and this improvement interacted with condition. These results suggest that more specific information on children's performance and more frequent and precise adaptations might lead to better learning outcomes. As this was not possible in this study, future research should explore hybrid solutions that enable children to practice scientific reasoning with physical materials while receiving adaptive support via their computers.

However, it is challenging to address non-economic issues because businesses are designed to maximize profit and are less aligned with global ecological and social challenges. Shifting from linear supply chain thinking to interconnected, circular, ecosystem thinking could offer insights into addressing these challenges. Looking at time-tested patterns and strategies from natural ecosystems that operate using, reusing, and repurposing materials and components in a way that is sustainable, may allow for innovative and effective solutions for businesses to begin addressing these global challenges. Biomimicry, an approach to innovation that seeks solutions to human challenges by emulating nature, can inspire evolutionary and structural aspects of business ecosystems. Biomimetic insights related to mycorrhizal (root-fungus) networks are used as a foundation of this research. This research draws on network theory and complex adaptive systems (CAS) to translate the biomimetic language to the language of networked business systems. Based on literature and interview data gathered from five businesses, biomimetic principles were developed that can guide businesses as they transition from linear, wasteful chains to circular business value systems. In particular, business ecosystems require more participants in the roles of 'scavengers' and 'decomposers' and an underlying infrastructure, that helps to manage information and material flows in an integrated way.

Intelligent forecaster of concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, O3, SO2) caused air pollution (IFCsAP)	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						IFCsAP; DNS-PSO; DLSTM; PM2; 5; PM10; NO2; CO; O3; SO2; Air quality index	PREDICTION; SYSTEM; OPTIMIZATION	Upgrading health reality is the responsibility of all, it is necessary to think about the design of a smart system based on modern technologies to reduce the time and effort exerted on the competent authorities in both health and environmental sectors furthermore making their work environment smart and easy to enable the creativity and innovation as well as to reduce the material costs granted by state of this case "environment." The process to find a solution for the problem of a triangle as shown in Figure (1) with contradictory heads is a very important and difficult issue in the field of health and environment, these are: (to optimize time utilization, and minimize the human errors, that accompany this human effort as much as possible, and to reduce material costs). Therefore, the idea of Internet technology and the Intelligent Big Data Analysis was developed to design an integrate electronic system of hardware to be developed in different and specific locations to collect information on concentrations that cause air pollution. So, it was invested an idea of Internet of things technology and intelligent data analysis ("Internet of things" and "Intelligent Data Analysis") for the construction of an integrated system of Hardware entities and Software entities placed. The aim of this work is to build a programmable system capable of predicting the pollutant concentrations within the next 48 h called intelligent forecaster of concentrations caused air pollution (IFCsAP) and making the machine the primary source of information after these concentrations are collected and stored in real time. On this basis, we will rely on modern technologies to reach this goal. The proposed design is highly efficient, cost-effective and easy to use and can be deployed in all places (environment with concentrations of air pollution). The main objective of the proposed system is to issue periodic reports (within 48 h of the future) based on the information input from different stations in real time. These reports are issued based on the readings of sensors planted at each station. Each sensor has a measurement of one or more concentrations that cause air pollution. Designed system consists of three basic phases: the construction phase of an integrated electronic circuit consisting of several devices (Modern, LoRa, Waspmate Platform, Arduino, Five sensors).

If species are not known to science, they cannot be assessed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and so the possibility to protect them from extinction is reduced. Furthermore, until species are known to science they cannot be fully scientifically evaluated for their potential as new foods, medicines, and products which would help address SDGs 1,2,3, and 8. SummaryScientific discovery, including naming new taxa, is important because without a scientific name, a species is invisible to science and the possibilities of researching its ecology, applications and threats, and conserving it, are greatly reduced. We review new scientific discoveries in the plant and fungal kingdoms, based largely on new names of taxa published in 2019 and indexed in the International Plant Names Index and Index Fungorum. Numbers of new species in both kingdoms were similar with 1942 new species of plant published and 1882 species of fungi. However, while >50% of plant species have likely been discovered, >90% of fungi remain unknown. This gulf likely explains the greater number of higher order taxa for fungi published in 2019: three classes, 18 orders, 48 families and 214 genera versus one new family and 87 new genera for plants. We compare the kingdoms in terms of rates of scientific discovery, globally and in different taxonomic groups and geographic areas, and with regard to the use of DNA in discovery. We review species new to science, especially those of interest to humanity as new products, and also by life-form. We consider where future such discoveries can be expected. We recommend an urgent increase in investment in scientific discovery of plant and fungal species, while they still survive. Priorities include more investment in training taxonomists, in building and equipping collections-based research centers for them, especially in species-rich, income-poor countries where the bulk of species as yet unknown to science are thought to occur.

However, the assimilation of diverse methodologies evidence the lack of development of those scientific competencies necessary for professionals to be graduated and therefore required by the labour market. This research examines the research competencies of students of higher education sample (N=189) to determine their appreciation towards scientific competencies they consider to have developed in both their educational processes. The results prove the perception of subjects in respect to the development of interpersonal and intrapersonal skills, decision-making, problem-solving and acquisition of scientific competences,the basic ones; use of technology, appropriation of new knowledge, self-learning and search of information, specialized competences, drafting of reports, design of articles, presentations, development of degree works and definition of new projects. The application of ANOVA detects that there are significant differences according to the gender of subjects on competencies referred to the search of physical information where women stand out, and reading comprehension of documents in English where men stand out. Besides, it's demonstrated that these competences contribute to students' critical thinking. IES required to include research as mechanism to strengthen the education.

The level of energy consumption is compared to the domestic and international advanced levels regarding the project energy use and process analysis, in all aspects of energy production and energy consumption, taking technically feasible, economically reasonable and environmentally and socially responsible measures and effective and rational use of energy, to reduce consumption and losses and to stop waste, while investigating if the project has a certain advanced and rational use of energy. This study provides a full consideration of whether there is a scientific and rational use of energy to avoid low-level repetition construction, to avoid blind expansion trends, and to promote the upgrading of industrial structure. This paper takes as an example a gas turbine power plant in Shenzhen as an assessment case study of the potential energy savings. The project is expected to have an annual power supply of 37.89 x 10(8) kW h and an annual heat supply of 5.43 x 10(4) G.J. The consumption of power generation in tons of coal equivalent units is expected to reach 208 g per kW h. The comprehensive annual average thermal efficiency is 77.16%, and the average heat-to-power ratio is 40.65%. These technical indicators are thought to be one of the best compared to similar level projects in the country. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To gain an understanding of the impact of such an instruction, this study examines the effectiveness of Video Inquiry-based Cooperative Learning (VICL) and Video Inquiry-based Learning (VIL) on students' performance and motivation in learning physics, particularly the "Forces and Angles" topic. Students' learning styles (converger and assimilator) were also included as a moderator variable. A quasi-experimental design was employed to measure the relationship between learning modes (VICL and VIL) and learning styles (converger and assimilator) on students' performance and motivation. A total of 101 students were recruited, of which 59 were assigned to the experimental group (VICL) and the remaining 42 to the control group (VIL). The findings indicate that compared to VIL, VICL is effective in enhancing the students' performance, but not their motivation. The VICL treatment promoted critical thinking and active engagement among the students in the experimental activity. However, their learning styles showed no significant influence on their performance and motivation. The conclusions and implications of this study are further described.

The micro-rheological parameters of blood, such as red blood cell deformability and red blood cell aggregation are influenced by several metabolic factors, and provide information regarding inflammatory, septic and tissue or organ ischemia-reperfusion processes. Despite the anticipated logical relation of the blood acid-base condition, blood gas parameters and pH to red blood cell deformability and aggregation, controversial data can be found in the literature. Furthermore, related to ischemia-reperfusion hemorheological studies little is known about this issue. In this paper we aimed to thought-provokingly overview some aspect of acid-base changes, blood pH and hemorheological parameters, discussing certain results from ischemia-reperfusion experimental surgical models (local versus systemic changes), laboratory technical and experimental design protocols related to in vitro and in vivo studies.

J	Jin, RY; Zou, PX; Li, B; Piroozfar, P; Painting, N				Jin, Ruoyu; Zou, Patrick Xiaowei; Li, Bo; Piroozfar, Poorang; Painting, Noel			Comparisons of students' perceptions on BIM practice among Australia, China and UK	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Education; Case study; Pedagogy; Building information modelling; Comparative analysis; Constructions education; Questionnaire survey; Information and communication technology (ICT) applications; Subgroup analysis; Individual perceptions	CONSTRUCTION; IMPLEMENTATION; COLLABORATION; RISK	Purpose - University students are the future driving forces in and leaders of the architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) industry advancement. Although BIM pedagogical studies have been performed in different institutions, there has not been sufficient research providing a global perspective of BIM education and students' perceptions toward BIM practice and application following their learning progress. The purpose of this paper is to adopt student samples from Swinburne University of Technology (SUT, Australia), Wenzhou University (WZU, China) and University of Brighton (UK) as three case studies to investigate the BIM practice and application-related perceptions and motivations. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the thorough understanding of the BIM pedagogical delivery including teaching contents and assessment methods among the three institutions, a questionnaire survey approach was adopted to collect AEC students' perceptions of BIM. Within each selected case, statistical analysis was conducted to investigate both the overall sample and subgroup differences regarding students' opinions on BIM's functions (e.g. as a 3D visualization tool) and BIM usefulness in various industry professions, their motivation in BIM-related jobs and their perceptions of challenges encountered in BIM practice and application. Multiple factors influencing BIM learners' perceptions were discussed, such as pedagogical assessment approach, and individual factors (e.g. disciplines). Findings - The results showed that students were able to discern the latest industry practices and critical thinking in BIM movements. For example, SUT students perceived more challenges from the government legislation or incentive policies, which was consistent with Australia's BIM policy movement. WZU students tended to have less positive views on BIM usefulness. The results also indicated fewer differences regarding perceived challenges among students from these three institutions. Originality/value - This study contributed to the body of knowledge in managerial BIM by focusing on learners' perceptions from the perspective of students' understanding, motivation and individual views of BIM, which were insightful to both BIM educators and employers. By initiating the framework of BIM learning process and its influence factors, the current study serves as a point of reference to continue the future work in strengthening the connection between institutional BIM education and industry practical needs worldwide.

For the further development of hydrate-based technology, it is necessary to investigate the growth behaviors of hydrates and identify the factors that affect their morphology. A morphological study involves the observation of the characteristic appearance of the hydrate, including the shape, size, and mode of hydrate growth, which provides valuable information on the mechanism of hydrate formation, optimizes the industrial process with fast kinetics, and avoids geological hazards. On this basis, this paper reviews the morphology of gas hydrates from two scales, the macroscopic formation of gas hydrates and the crystal morphology of gas hydrates, for the further development of hydrate technology.

J	Draper, H; Sorell, T				Draper, Heather; Sorell, Tom			Ethical values and social care robots for older people: an international qualitative study	ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Social robots; Ethics; Values; Qualitative research	HEALTH	Values such as respect for autonomy, safety, enablement, independence, privacy and social connectedness should be reflected in the design of social robots. The same values should affect the process by which robots are introduced into the homes of older people to support independent living. These values may, however, be in tension. We explored what potential users thought about these values, and how the tensions between them could be resolved. With the help of partners in the ACCOMPANY project, 21 focus groups (123 participants) were convened in France, the Netherlands and the UK. These groups consisted of: (i) older people, (ii) informal carers and (iii) formal carers of older people. The participants were asked to discuss scenarios in which there is a conflict between older people and others over how a robot should be used, these conflicts reflecting tensions between values. Participants favoured compromise, persuasion and negotiation as a means of reaching agreement. Roles and related role-norms for the robot were thought relevant to resolving tensions, as were hypothetical agreements between users and robot-providers before the robot is introduced into the home. Participants' understanding of each of the values-autonomy, safety, enablement, independence, privacy and social connectedness-is reported. Participants tended to agree that autonomy often has priority over the other values, with the exception in certain cases of safety. The second part of the paper discusses how the values could be incorporated into the design of social robots and operationalised in line with the views expressed by the participants.

Design: On-line questionnaire. Participants: Thirty present and previous members of Transplant Sport 'therapy team' (age; 35 +/- 14 years, 24 female). Main outcome measures: Questions concerned demographics and general information on the background of the therapists. Closed questions with rating statements concerning beliefs when treating TxA and open questions asking for advice the participants would give to colleagues and further information they would like to have available to them. Results: TxA were thought to be a vulnerable group of athletes requiring special precautions and considerations. Two areas of information evolved: "general advice for TxA management" and "specific advice for therapists". General advice was to understand TxAs and be vigilant with hygiene. Specific therapy advice was to avoid grade V manipulations and care with taping and massage, because of complications resulting from side effects of long-term medication. Conclusion: There appears to be a lack of research-based evidence to guide practitioners in their management of TxAs. Generic, good advice is now available from experienced practitioners however there is a paucity of research evidence to support this. Thus, there is a potential danger of being overcautious in approaches to treatment which ultimately may impact on athletic performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A widespread evaluation method is to develop a global model that employs energy audit techniques, whereas they are always carried out with few appreciations of multiple energy consumption patterns, and the utilization of energy consumption auxiliary information. To address the challenge, a two-stage clustering-based-energy consumption evaluation method is proposed for process industries in this study. Specifically, a novel structure of the fuzzy clustering method is designed with a mixture of unsupervised and semi-supervised learning stages that leverages the weighted information to independently address energy consumption patterns. Then energy consumption predictions are estimated for potential energy-optimized control. The key performance indicators of energy consumption are calculated for each pattern, and the final evaluation grade will be achieved through the fuzzy synthetic evaluation method. According to the experiment results, the proposed method delivers better evaluation results against baselines with more accurate clustering; it may provide a new thought for energy consumption evaluation and is confirmed to enable practitioners to acquire the potential benefits in engineering.

However, there is scant literature guiding their integration for non-AI professionals. This study conducts a scoping literature review to address the critical need for guidance on integrating generative AI and LLMs into healthcare and medical practices. It elucidates the distinct mechanisms underpinning these technologies, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLFH), including few-shot learning and chain-of-thought reasoning, which differentiates them from traditional, rule-based AI systems. It requires an inclusive, collaborative co-design process that engages all pertinent stakeholders, including clinicians and consumers, to achieve these benefits. Although global research is examining both opportunities and challenges, including ethical and legal dimensions, LLMs offer promising advancements in healthcare by enhancing data management, information retrieval, and decision-making processes. Continued innovation in data acquisition, model fine-tuning, prompt strategy development, evaluation, and system implementation is imperative for realizing the full potential of these technologies. Organizations should proactively engage with these technologies to improve healthcare quality, safety, and efficiency, adhering to ethical and legal guidelines for responsible application.

However, since the functions of the application that are necessary for the pre-hospital process have been found not to be fully developed, the addition of a back-end system has been considered to increase its performance and usability. Objective To determine the ability of the previous version to effectively manage the pre-hospital process and analyse the current problems with the pre-hospital operation. Therefore, the new system was developed to support the connection of dispatch centres or operational centres to the Triagist mobile application and system evaluation. Method Design thinking methodology was used to analyse, design and develop a patient triage system to support the pre-hospital process in Thailand based on users' requirements. 68 active members of the rescue teams and emergency medical staff in Chiang Mai and Lampang provinces were recruited to test the reliability of the system based on a prototype application. Results The new medical mobile application for patient triage in Thailand was validated for use due to containing the two essential functions of Initial Dispatch Code (IDC) geolocation and IDC management. When the system was tested by emergency staff who were responsible for using it, those with the least experience were found to use it better than their highly experienced colleagues. Moreover, in cases where the system had been implemented, it was found to determine the frequency of symptoms, the time period during which cases occurred, and the density of cases in each area. Conclusion This system, which has been developed based on the use of smart technology, will play an important role in supporting emergency services in Thailand by enhancing the efficiency of the pre-hospital process. Emergency centres will receive IDC information from the geolocation system so that they can determine patients' location without undue delay. Emergency services will be able to rapidly prepare the necessary resources and administrative tasks will be supported by linking the dispatch centre to central rescue teams.

The PETEs (n = 169) completed one of the editions of a SL program carried out between 2015-2018. This program consisted of designing and leading motor game sessions to facilitate the inclusion of 116 children with special educational needs (SEN). The program was based on Kolb's learning stages to promote reflection and critical thinking. Reflective journals were used as an instrument to gather information from their experiences. These data were analysed qualitatively through a multiphase approach, initial open-coding and axial coding, using NVivo (10) software. Results were displayed through the categories of Butin's Conceptual Model: technical, cultural, political, and post-structural perspectives. SL provided the pre-service teachers an inclusive educational experience, allowing them to link theory and practice in a truly operative way.

The protein layer that is non-specifically adsorbed onto the implant surface immediately after implantation is thought to dictate this reaction. It is hypothesized that biomaterial surfaces having specific proteins with precisely controlled orientations will decrease the FBR. Previously, we have reported that osteopontin (OPN) adsorbed on positively charged surfaces has a preferable orientation for in vitro cell adhesion and spreading as compared to negatively charged surfaces. It is expected that coating a layer of OPN in its prefer-red orientation on an implant surface will decrease the FBR. In this work, in vivo studies were performed to test this hypothesis. A positively charged polymer (p(HEMA-co-AEMA)) and a negatively charged polymer (p(HEMA-co-CEA)) coated with OPN were implanted subcutaneously in wild-type mice for 7 or 28 days. Uncoated polymers were used as control. For the 7-day implants, cells on OPN-coated p(HEMA-co-AEMA) spread more than cells on the other three materials. Following 28 days of implantation the implants were explanted and the capsule thickness and vascularity around the implants were characterized. Additionally, the macrophage and foreign body giant cells (FBGCs) around the implants were quantified. It was found in this study that the modification of the positively charged polymer surface with OPN in a controlled orientation led to a reduction in the foreign body reaction as determined by capsule thickness. Our finding provides valuable information for designing better biocompatible biomaterials with improved in vivo performance.

The method borrows principles from the event tracking of interrelated causal events and deploys clustering methods to automatically measure the relevance and contribution made by each input event data (ED) on system outputs. The ethos of the proposed event modeling (EM) technique is that the behavior or the state of a system is a function of the knowledge acquired about events occurring in the system and its wider operational environment. As such it builds on the theoretical and the practical foundation for the engineering of knowledge and data in modern and complex systems. The proposed EM platform EventiC filters noncontributory ED sources and has the potential to include information that was initially thought irrelevant or simply not considered at the design stage. The real-time ability to group and rank relevant input-output ED in order of its importance and relevance will not only improve the data quality, but leads to an improved higher level of mathematical formulization in the modern complex systems. The contribution of the approach to systems' modeling is in the automation of data analysis, control, and plant process modeling. EventiC has been validated as the monitoring and the control system for a cement factory. In addition to the previously known parameters, the proposed EventiC identified new influential parameters that were previously unknown. It also filtered 18% of the input data without compromising the data quality or the integrity. The solution has improved the quality of input variable selection and simplify plant control strategies.

J	Ding, ZK; Wang, YF; Zou, PXW				Ding, Zhikun; Wang, Yifei; Zou, Patrick X. W.			An agent based environmental impact assessment of building demolition waste management: Conventional versus green management	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Demolition waste; Demolition waste management; Agent-based modeling; Environmental impact assessment; Deconstruction	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; CONSTRUCTION WASTE; SYSTEM DYNAMICS; LCA METHODOLOGY; SUPPLY-CHAIN; DECONSTRUCTION; DESIGN; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; MODEL	Waste materials generated from building demolition have become a great challenge to sustainable urban development due to its consumption of the limited landfill spaces, water pollution, energy consumption and harmful gas emissions. Proper management of demolition waste (DW) is a complex process and requires systematic thinking and analysis. Many methods have been proposed to study the environmental impact assessment of demolition waste management (DWM). However, it is found that the currently available studies pay little attention from the perspective of complex adaptive system (CAS) to consider the attitude and interaction of the heterogeneous stakeholders as well as the importance of green DWM which has a great influence on the effectiveness of DW management. The aim of this research is to simulate and explore how the change of attitude and the dynamic interaction among heterogeneous stakeholders can influence the environmental performance of DWM. To achieve this aim, a model for evaluating the environmental impact of DWM was developed by using an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach. The main factors considered in the model are the ratio of green deconstruction (i.e., building deconstruction) managers vs. conventional demolition (i.e. building destruction) managers, the ratio of green design managers (i.e. design for deconstruction) vs. conventional design managers, and the interaction behavior of heterogeneous stakeholders following the herd theory. In the model, the environmental impact assessment was quantified into four categories i.e. land resources, water resources, air resource and energy resources. The proposed model is demonstrated by using the data drawn from the Chinese construction industry. The results reveal that if the deconstruction method and the deconstruction oriented design are widely adopted by architects and engineers, the negative environmental impacts generated by DW can be reduced by at least 50%. Furthermore, the results provide valuable information for government departments to make decisions on how to improve environmental performance of DWM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Fei, ZH; Jia, SC; Li, Q				Fei, Zaihui; Jia, Shuangcheng; Li, Qian			Low-Cost and High-Precision Lane-Level Vehicle Positioning Method in an Urban Area Based on Traversal Optimization for MIMU Calibration Parameters	ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Navigation; Dichotomy traversal parameter optimization; MIMU dead reckoning; RTK outages	INS/GPS INTEGRATION; GENERATION	Low-cost positioning system usually consists of Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) and Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU). For urban applications, RTK signals are often poor or lost in dense high buildings, bridges, and tunnels. In that situation, only Dead Reckoning (DR) would be used. However, DR fails to provide satisfactory accuracy limited by the parameter errors of low-cost MIMU. To address this challenge, we propose a positioning method based on traversal optimization for MIMU calibration parameters. More specifically, First, the time difference between RTK and IMU is determined by comparing accelerated velocity and angular velocity (namely motion information). For RTK, a B-spline is applied to get the motion information by calculating the derivative of the RTK position and azimuth angle. Secondly, under the criterion of minimum accumulative errors of synchronized motion information between RTK and IMU, a novel calibration method is designed based on binary tree traversal thought to obtain the optimal MIMU calibration parameters and the accurate initial navigation information. Then, using the calculated parameters and information, the DR algorithm is employed to realize high-precision lane-level positioning. We conduct extensive experiments, and the results demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve a high positioning accuracy of 0.56 m (RMSE) when RTK signals are lost for 45s, which is almost equivalent to the performance of the positioning system equipped with high-cost sensors. Our method can significantly reduce system costs and realize high accuracy for urban applications. Moreover, our method is the potential to be extended into other fields such as advanced driving assistance systems, autonomous vehicles, and mapping systems.

Generally, most of the dispersal of demersal fishes is thought to be driven by the transport of eggs and larvae in currents, with the potential contribution of dispersal in later life stages relatively minimal. Using otolith chemistry analyses, we estimate dispersal patterns across a spatial scale of approximately 180 km at both propagule (i.e. eggs and larvae) and juvenile (i.e. between settlement and recruitment) stages of a Mediterranean coastal fishery species, the two-banded seabream Diplodus vulgaris. We detected three major natal sources of propagules replenishing local populations in the entire study area, suggesting that propagule dispersal distance extends to at least 90 km. For the juvenile stage, we detected dispersal of up to 165 km. Outwork highlights the surprising and significant role of dispersal during the juvenile life stages as an important mechanism connecting populations. Such new insights are crucial for creating effective management strategies (e.g. MPAs and MPA networks) and to gain support from policymakers and stakeholders, highlighting that MPA benefits can extend well beyond MPA borders, and not only via dispersal of eggs and larvae, but also through movement by juveniles.

However, these measures provide limited information about sub- or preconscious signals and cognitive processes that also affect students' item-solving strategies and abilities. A growing number of researchers in chemical education research have begun to address this gap by using physiological measurements to assess cognitive load (e.g., heart rate and EEG) and to look at item-solving strategies (e.g., via eye tracking). One physiological measure of cognitive load that has been well-documented in psychology literature is pupil dilation. In this study, two streams of eye-tracking data (gaze and pupillometric data) were combined to reveal information about what mental tasks general chemistry students were engaged in as they answered Chemical Concepts Inventory (CCI) questions (gaze stream) and how those mental tasks elicited changing levels of cognitive load (pupillometric stream). We found that, for complex multiple-choice tasks, pupil dilation fluctuated throughout the course of solving the item. For a more straightforward true/false task, there was a marked difference in pupil signal between participants who correctly answered the question and those who incorrectly answered it. Those who correctly answered the question had linearly increasing pupillary signals, whereas those who incorrectly answered had pupil signals that more closely resembled those observed during the multiple-choice tasks. Interpretations of these differences are supported using retrospective interviews and previously published literature about CCI items.	[Karch, Jessica M.; Valles, Josibel C.

J	González, XM; Rodríguez, M; Pena-Boquete, Y				Manuel Gonzalez, Xose; Rodriguez, Miguel; Pena-Boquete, Yolanda			The social benefits of WEEE re-use schemes. A cost benefit analysis for PCs in Spain	WASTE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						WEEE; Re-use schemes; Externalities; Cost benefit analysis	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT WEEE; PERSONAL COMPUTERS; MANAGEMENT	One goal of the new European legislation set out in WEEE Directive 2012/19/UE is the promotion of WEEE re-use schemes. However, some authors are rather sceptical about the contribution of WEEE re-use schemes to improve resource efficiency. In order to evaluate and to design adequate policy instruments, some authors recommend the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) as a compulsory first step. In this context, the main contribution of this paper is to enlarge the empirical literature by providing a CBA of re-use schemes versus recycling processes of PCs. The analysis is made for Spain by quantifying in monetary terms the social damages of environmental impacts such as climate change, human toxicity, particulate matter formation, metal depletion, etc. Our results suggest that promoting re-use against recycling (and consequently the need for manufacturing a new PC from raw materials) may reduce environmental costs by 45.20 sic per PC. Those social benefits are mainly generated in the re-use preparation process and distribution activities, whereas the re-use scenario displays a worse performance in energy consumption. The difference in the distribution stage during the second life cycle originates from the fact that the ready to re-use product is produced locally, while the brand new product is manufactured and distributed from abroad, mainly Asia. These results provide valuable information to policymakers and think tanks willing to design support schemes for re-use over recycling operations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With the growing interest of integrating information and communication technologies (ICTs) into learning and teaching, the use of multimedia technology and digital games offered an alternate method of instruction. Multimedia objects play an important role in the classroom setting because of its ability to provide a virtual environment for learners to effectively acquire knowledge. This paper presents part of the findings of a research project that focused on the advantages of multimedia technology and the benefits of digital game-based learning. By using sample lessons from an interactive multimedia courseware called "DigiGEMs," this paper emphasizes the use of digital games as a vital tool in mathematics learning. The study sets out to examine if a positive attitude exists among young learners towards the learning of mathematical concepts. The DigiGEMs is targeted at primary school children aged between 7 to 9 years old, who can practice mathematical thinking skills in an appealing manner. This paper also describes the efficacy of using multimedia and game-based approaches to motivate mathematical learnings among Primary 1 to 3 students. The research findings corroborate with the hypothesis that digital game-based learning is more effective than traditional classbased learning in acquiring mathematical knowledge. It is hoped that the discussion in this paper will encourage other researchers to not only conduct further studies on children's learnings in the context of digital game-based learning environment in mathematics, but also to adopt game based-learning for other subjects such as science and languages in which the above elements (i.e., multimedia objects and digital games) are cohesively and dynamically integrated to optimise the teaching and learning processes.

J	Stenner, R; Palmer, S; Hammond, R				Stenner, Rob; Palmer, Shea; Hammond, Ralph			What matters most to people in musculoskeletal physiotherapy consultations? A qualitative study	MUSCULOSKELETAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Communication; Qualitative research; Physical therapy modalities; Referral and consultation	LOW-BACK-PAIN; PATIENT COMMUNICATION; DECISION-MAKING; MANAGEMENT; CARE	Background: Person-centred approaches to care require clinicians to engage in trying to understand the full range of problems and concerns, treatment and investigation requests, and emotional and social issues that people bring to the consultation. If, however, the main issues of importance are not openly declared and discussed they cannot be addressed. This is likely to result in people receiving the care that clinicians think they need, rather than care based on individual needs and preferences. Objective: To understand people's abilities to express the issues of importance to them within a consultation and clinicians' abilities to acknowledge and address those issues. Design: A qualitative study using an interpretive phenomenological approach. Methods: Fifteen people and their physiotherapists were interviewed and their consultations recorded. The resulting data sets were analysed to identify and report themes within the data. Findings: The findings revealed that people present with what are often simple issues, but which are sometimes expressed in an unstructured way in clinical encounters and are often difficult for clinicians to establish. Three linked themes emerged: (1) clear versus unstructured agendas; (2) people need information and understanding; and (3) developing a sense of collaboration. Conclusions: The issues of importance that people bring to a consultation are varied and often vague. This research highlights the importance of communication to elicit, identify and address the issues of importance to people in clinical encounters to ensure a positive experience and outcome for both the individual person and clinician. Tweetable Abstract: Achieving desirable health outcomes is more likely when people are supported to think about their priorities and 'what matters to them'.

While adaptive changes in retinal processing to the variations of the mean luminance level and second-order stimulus statistics have been documented before, no such measurements have been performed when higher-order moments of the light distribution change. We therefore measured the ganglion cell responses in the tiger salamander retina to controlled changes in the second (contrast), third (skew) and fourth (kurtosis) moments of the light intensity distribution of spatially uniform temporally independent stimuli. The skew and kurtosis of the stimuli were chosen to cover the range observed in natural scenes. We quantified adaptation in ganglion cells by studying linear-nonlinear models that capture well the retinal encoding properties across all stimuli. We found that the encoding properties of retinal ganglion cells change only marginally when higher-order statistics change, compared to the changes observed in response to the variation in contrast. By analyzing optimal coding in LN-type models, we showed that neurons can maintain a high information rate without large dynamic adaptation to changes in skew or kurtosis. This is because, for uncorrelated stimuli, spatio-temporal summation within the receptive field averages away non-gaussian aspects of the light intensity distribution.

The models trained from synthetic data are difficult to generalize in some surveys. Recently, training 3-D fault segmentation using sparse manual 2-D slices is thought to yield promising results, but manual labeling has many false negative labels (FNLs) (abnormal annotations), which is detrimental to training and consequently to detection performance. Motivated to train 3-D fault segmentation networks under sparse 2-D labels while suppressing FNLs, we analyze the training process gradient and propose the mask dice (MD) loss. Moreover, the fault is an edge feature, and current encoder-decoder architectures widely used for fault detection (e.g., U-shape network) are not conducive to edge representation. Consequently, fault-net is proposed, which is designed for the characteristics of faults, employs high-resolution propagation features, and embeds multiscale compression fusion block to fuse multiscale information, which allows the edge information to be fully preserved during propagation and fusion, thus enabling advanced performance via few computational resources. The experiment demonstrates that MD loss supports the inclusion of human experience in training and suppresses FNLs therein, enabling baseline models to improve performance and generalize to more surveys. Fault-Net is capable of providing a more stable and reliable interpretation of faults, and it uses extremely low computational resources and inference is significantly faster than other models. Our method indicates optimal performance in comparison with several mainstream methods.

Existing tactile feedback devices have the problem of being large and expensive, and most studies have not explored the ability of the affected area to distinguish an external stimulus, thus it is difficult to perform natural human-computer interactions. This article describes the development of a device that can transmit multimodal tactile information in accordance with the characteristics of human hand skin perception during a human-computer interaction. The device has 10 miniature vibrators (Phi = 10 mm, d=2.7 mm) and 2 semiconductor refrigerators (23 mm x 23 mm x 4 mm), which can achieve temperature and vibration feedback. First, the structure and working principle of the device were introduced, and the device's performance was analyzed. Subsequently, an experiment based on the perception characteristics of human hand skin was designed. The experiment determined the vibration level (1-5), heating level (I-IV), and cooling level (I-III) that are consistent with the perception characteristics of the hand skin. Finally, a chemical experiment was designed to test the performance of the device. The results of the experiment showed that 92% of the volunteers thought the device had a higher sense of authenticity and immersion than the traditional virtual reality experience.

We surveyed 382 cat adopters to assess adoption outcomes and potential determinants of adopters' choice of cat age group and price. Most adopters had benevolent motivations for adopting from the shelter and had put considerable thought into the adoption and responsible ownership requirements. However, adult cat adopters were more likely to have been influenced by price than kitten adopters. Adoption outcomes were generally positive in all age and adoption price groups. This study provides evidence to inform the design of strategies to encourage adult cat adoptions. Abstract: The percentage of adult cats euthanized in animal shelters is greater than that of kittens because adult cats are less likely to be adopted. This study aimed to provide evidence to inform the design of strategies to encourage adult cat adoptions. One such strategy is to discount adoption prices, but there are concerns that this may result in poor adoption outcomes. We surveyed 382 cat adopters at the time of adoption, to assess potential determinants of adopters' cat age group choice (adult or kitten) and, for adult cat adopters, the price they are willing to pay. The same respondents were surveyed again 6-12 months after the adoption to compare outcomes between cat age groups and between adult cats in two price categories. Most adopters had benevolent motivations for adopting from the shelter and had put considerable thought into the adoption and requirements for responsible ownership. However, adult cat adopters were more likely to have been influenced by price than kitten adopters. Adoption outcomes were generally positive for both adult cats and kittens and for adult cats adopted at low prices. The latter finding alleviates concerns about the outcomes of "low-cost" adoptions in populations, such as the study population, and lends support for the use of "low-cost" adoptions as an option for attempting to increase adoption rates. In addition, the results provide information that can be used to inform future campaigns aimed at increasing the number of adult cat adoptions, particularly in devising marketing strategies for adult cats.

The parameters in the extended equilibrium distribution are determined through an inverse design process. This new LBGK model is then validated using two benchmark cases, i.e., the 2D decaying Taylor-Green vortex flow and the lid-driven cavity flow. The accuracy and stability of the new model are discussed. The new model clearly extends the standard LBGK model as it was previously thought to be impossible to construct an LBGK model for the N-S equations on a rectangular grid. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Literature published before 2010 was excluded. Students should be attending either a Professional Bachelor's degree or a Bachelor's degree programme. Full-text articles were screened by pairs of reviewers and data extracted regarding: study characteristics and key methods of teaching evidence-based practice. Study characteristics were described narratively. Thematic analysis identified key methods for teaching evidence-based practice, while full-text revisions identified the use of the Sicily Statement's five steps and context.ResultsThe database search identified 2220 records. One hundred ninety-two records were eligible for full-text assessment and 81 studies were included. Studies were conducted from 2010 to 2018. Approximately half of the studies were undertaken in the USA. Study designs were primarily qualitative and participants mainly nursing students. Seven key methods for teaching evidence-based practice were identified. Research courses and workshops, Collaboration with clinical practice and IT technology were the key methods most frequently identified. Journal clubs and Embedded librarians were referred to the least. The majority of the methods included 2-4 of the Sicily Statement's five steps, while few methods referred to all five steps.ConclusionsThis scoping review has provided an extensive overview of literature describing methods for teaching EBP regarding undergraduate healthcare students. The two key methods Research courses and workshops and Collaboration with clinical practice are advantageous methods for teaching undergraduate healthcare students evidence-based practice; incorporating many of the Sicily Statement's five steps. Unlike the Research courses and workshop methods, the last step of evaluation is carried out partly or entirely in a clinical context. Journal clubs and Embedded librarians should be further investigated as methods to reinforce existing methods of teaching. Future research should focus on methods for teaching EBP that incorporate as many of the five steps of teaching and conducting EBP as possible.

Objective: To explore views of a digital health promotion intervention designed to be accessible to people with lower levels of health literacy, in particular examining reactions to the interactive and audiovisual elements of the intervention. Methods: Qualitative think-aloud interviews were carried out with 65 adults with type 2 diabetes in the UK, Ireland, USA, Germany, and Austria, with purposive sampling to ensure representation of people with lower levels of health literacy. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify common themes. We then systematically compared views in subgroups based on country, health literacy level, age, gender, and time since diagnosis. Results: Most participants from the chosen countries expressed positive views of most elements and features of the intervention. Some interactive and audiovisual elements required modification to increase their usability and perceived credibility and relevance. There were some differences in views based on age and gender, but very few differences relating to health literacy level or time since diagnosis. Conclusions: In general, participants found the intervention content and format accessible, appropriate, engaging, and motivating. Digital interventions can and should be designed to be accessible and engaging for people with a wide range of health literacy levels.

Determining the effects and challenges of incorporating genetic testing into primary care management of hypertensive patients with African ancestry	CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS			English	Article						Genetics; Chronic kidney disease; Disparities; African ancestry; Race; Community-based research	KIDNEY-FUNCTION DECLINE; HEALTH-CARE; PERSONALIZED MEDICINE; RECRUITING MINORITIES; RACIAL DISPARITIES; VARIANTS ASSOCIATE; STROKE PREVENTION; RISK-ASSESSMENT; APOL1 VARIANTS; CLINICAL-TRIAL	People of African ancestry (Blacks) have increased risk of kidney failure due to numerous socioeconomic, environmental, and clinical factors. Two variants in the APOL1 gene are now thought to account for much of the racial disparity associated with hypertensive kidney failure in Blacks. However, this knowledge has not been translated into clinical care to help improve patient outcomes and address disparities. GUARDD is a randomized trial to evaluate the effects and challenges of incorporating genetic risk information into primary care. Hypertensive, non diabetic, adults with self-reported African ancestry, without kidney dysfunction, are recruited from diverse clinical settings and randomized to undergo APOL1 genetic testing at baseline (intervention) or at one year (waitlist control). Providers are educated about genomics and APOL1. Guided by a genetic counselor, trained staff return APOL1 results to patients and provide low-literacy educational materials. Real-time clinical decision support tools alert clinicians of their patients' APOL1 results and associated risk status at the point of care. Our academic-community-clinical partnership designed a study to generate information about the impact of genetic risk information on patient care (blood pressure and renal surveillance) and on patient and provider knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. GUARDD will help establish the effective implementation of APOL1 risk informed management of hypertensive patients at high risk of CKD, and will provide a robust framework for future endeavors to implement genomic medicine in diverse clinical practices. It will also add to the important dialog about factors that contribute to and may help eliminate racial disparities in kidney disease. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Horowitz, C.

Pupil response to social-emotional material is associated with rumination and depressive symptoms in adults with autism spectrum disorder	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; NEGATIVE THINKING; ASPERGER SYNDROME; NEUTRAL FACES; DILATION; ADOLESCENTS; ANXIETY; INFORMATION; REACTIVITY; THERAPY	Background Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is marked by repetitive thinking and high rates of depression. Understanding the extent to which repetitive negative thinking in ASD reflects autistic stereotypy versus general depressive thinking patterns (e.g., rumination) could help guide treatment research to improve emotional health in ASD. We compared associations between rumination, depressive symptoms, and pupil response to social-emotional material in adults with ASD and typically developing (TD) adults with and without depression. Methods N = 53 verbally fluent young adults were recruited to three cohorts: ASD, n = 21; TD-depressed, n = 13; never-depressed TD-controls, n = 19. Participants completed Ruminative Response Scale and Beck Depression Inventory self-reports and a passive-viewing task employing emotionally-expressive faces, during which pupillary motility was assessed to quantify cognitive-affective load. Main and interactive effects of cohort, emotion condition, and time on pupil amplitude were tested via a linear mixed effects analysis of variance using restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Similar procedures were used to test for effects of rumination and depressive symptoms on pupil amplitude over time within ASD. Results Responsive pupil dilation in the ASD cohort tended to be significantly lower than TD-depressed initially but increased to comparable levels by trial end. When viewing sad faces, individuals with ASD who had higher depression scores resembled TD-depressed participants' faster, larger, and sustained pupil response. Within ASD, depressive symptoms uniquely predicted early pupil response to sad faces, while rumination and depression scores each independently predicted sustained pupil response. Conclusions People with elevated depressive symptoms appear to have faster and greater increases in pupil-indexed neural activation following sad stimuli, regardless of ASD status, suggesting the utility of conceptualizing rumination as depression-like in treatment. Ruminative processes may increase more slowly in ASD, suggesting the potential utility of interventions that decrease reactions before they are uncontrollable. Findings also reinforce the importance of testing for effects of internalizing variables in broader ASD research.

Different macaque models of cognitive aging exhibit task-dependent behavioral disparities	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Object recognition memory; Visuospatial short-term memory; Object-reward association memory; Bonnet macaques; Rhesus macaques; WGTA	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MONKEY MACACA-MULATTA; AGED RHESUS-MONKEYS; EXECUTIVE SYSTEM DYSFUNCTION; COMPENSATORY BRAIN ACTIVITY; NONHUMAN PRIMATE MODELS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; RECOGNITION MEMORY; PERIRHINAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY	Deficits in cognitive functions that rely on the integrity of the frontal and temporal lobes are characteristic of normative human aging. Due to similar aging phenotypes and homologous cortical organization between nonhuman primates and humans, several species of macaque monkeys are used as models to explore brain senescence. These macaque species are typically regarded as equivalent models of cognitive aging, yet no direct comparisons have been made to support this assumption. Here we used adult and aged rhesus and bonnet macaques (Macaca mulaaa and Macaca radiata) to characterize the effect of age on acquisition and retention of information across delays in a battery of behavioral tasks that rely on prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe networks. The cognitive functions that were tested include visuospatial short-term memory, object recognition memory, and object-reward association memory. In general, bonnet macaques at all ages outperformed rhesus macaques on tasks thought to rely primarily on the prefrontal cortex, and were more resilient to age-related deficits in these behaviors. On the other hand, both species were comparably impaired by age on tasks thought to preferentially engage the medial temporal lobe. Together, these results suggest that rhesus and bonnet macaques are not equivalent models of cognitive aging and highlight the value of cross-species comparisons. These observations should enable improved design and interpretation of future experiments aimed at understanding changes in cognition across the lifespan.

Results from online focus group discussions with childhood cancer survivors in Sweden	HUMAN REPRODUCTION			English	Article						childhood cancer; infertility; focus group discussions; adolescents and young adults; qualitative research	QUALITATIVE CONTENT-ANALYSIS; YOUNG-ADULT SURVIVORS; FERTILITY; ADOLESCENT; RISK; INFERTILITY; PARENTHOOD; CHILDREN; ISSUES; IMPACT	STUDY QUESTION: What do adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood cancer think about the risk of being infertile? SUMMARY ANSWER: The potential infertility, as well as the experience of having had cancer, affects well-being, intimate relationships and the desire to have children in the future. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Many childhood cancer survivors want to have children and worry about possible infertility. study design, size, duration: For this qualitative study with a cross-sectional design, data were collected through 39 online focus group discussions during 2013. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Cancer survivors previously treated for selected diagnoses were identified from The Swedish Childhood Cancer Register (16-24 years old at inclusion, >= 5 years after diagnosis) and approached regarding study participation. Online focus group discussions of mixed sex (n = 133) were performed on a chat platform in real time. Texts from the group discussions were analysed using qualitative content analysis. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The analysis resulted in the main category Is it possible to have a baby? including five generic categories: Risk of infertility affects well-being, Dealing with possible infertility, Disclosure of possible infertility is a challenge, Issues related to heredity and Parenthood may be affected. The risk of infertility was described as having a negative impact on well-being and intimate relationships. Furthermore, the participants described hesitation about becoming a parent due to perceived or anticipated physical and psychological consequences of having had cancer. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Given the sensitive topic of the study, the response rate (36%) is considered acceptable. The sample included participants who varied with regard to received fertility-related information, current fertility status and concerns related to the risk of being infertile. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The results may be transferred to similar contexts with other groups of patients of childbearing age and a risk of impaired fertility due to disease. The findings imply that achieving parenthood, whether or not with biological children, is an area that needs to be addressed by health care services. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study was financially supported by The Cancer Research Foundations of Radiumhemmet, The Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation and the Doctoral School in Health Care Science, Karolinska Institutet.

J	Jones, P; Hillier, D; Comfort, D				Jones, Peter; Hillier, David; Comfort, Daphne			Shopping for tomorrow: promoting sustainable consumption within food stores	BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL			English	Article						Sustainable consumption; Food retailers; Food industry; Marketing communications; Retailers; United Kingdom		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to offer an exploratory case study of how the UK's top ten food retailers are communicating sustainable consumption agendas to their customers within stores. Design/methodology/approach - The paper begins with a discussion of the growing awareness of the role that retailers, and more particularly food retailers, can play in promoting sustainable consumption. This is followed by a short literature review of current thinking on sustainable consumption. Information obtained from two simple "walk through/visual observation and information collection" surveys conducted within the largest store operated by each of the top ten food retailers within the towns of Cheltenham and Gloucester, UK, provided the empirical material for the case study. The paper concludes with some reflections on how sustainable consumption fits into the large food retailers' business models. Findings - The survey revealed that, while the UK's top ten food retailers were providing customers with some information on sustainable consumption, the dominant thrust of marketing communication within stores was designed to encourage consumption. More generally, the paper concludes that, at best, the UK's leading food retailers are pursuing a weak model of sustainable consumption and that their definitions of, and engagement with, sustainable consumption is driven as much by commercial imperatives as by commitments to sustainability. Originality/value - This paper provides an accessible review of the extent to which the UK's leading food retailers are communicating sustainable consumption agendas to their customers within stores and as such it will be of value to academics, practitioners, consumer organisations and policy makers interested in the role retailers can play in promoting sustainable consumption.

The influence of resource interdependence during problem solving in groups: tracking changes in knowledge structure	ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Group problem solving; Resource interdependence; Convergence and divergence; Well-structured and ill-structured problem; Knowledge structure	GROUP DECISION-MAKING; COLLABORATIVE INHIBITION; CONCEPT MAPS; MODELS; INFORMATION; MECHANISMS; ONLINE	This experimental investigation seeks to confirm and extend previous investigations that resource interdependence vs. independence during problem-solving relatively extends the problem representation phase before convergence on a solution. In this current investigation, ninth-grade Korean native language participants (n = 240) worked online to complete either a well-structured or an ill-structured problem in either independent triads where all of the members were provided with all of the information needed to solve the problem, or in interdependent triads where members were each provided with different portions of the information needed. The discussions were analyzed using a content analysis rubric from Engelmann and Hesse (JAMA 5:299-319, 2010), and knowledge structures were elicited as concept maps and essays and then analyzed using a graph-theoretic psychometric network scaling approach. Analysis of transcripts of the triad interactions showed a similar pattern of divergence and then convergence for the well-structured and the ill-structured problems that confirmed the previous investigations. As anticipated, interdependent triads performed relatively better on the ill-structured problem perhaps due to the extended divergence phase, while independent triads were better on the well-structured problem perhaps due to a rapid transition to the convergence phase. Knowledge structure analysis of group maps shows that the interdependent triad maps resembled the fully explicated problem space, while the independent triad maps most resembled the narrow problem solution space. Suggestions for practice include first increasing students' awareness of divergent and convergent thinking, allowing enough time for the activity, and also requiring teams to submit a problem space artifact before working on a solution. Such skills are a basis for learning in school, but more importantly, will prepare students for a world where change is a constant and learning never stops.

Speakers adapt gestures to addressees' knowledge: implications for models of co-speech gesture	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						audience design; gesture; dialogue; common ground; spontaneous speech; storytelling; partner-specific adaptation; communication	CONVERSATIONAL HAND GESTURES; COMMON; EXPECTATIONS; EMBODIMENT; ACCESS; THINK	Are gesturing and speaking shaped by similar communicative constraints? In an experiment, we teased apart communicative from cognitive constraints upon multiple dimensions of speech-accompanying gestures in spontaneous dialogue. Typically, speakers attenuate old, repeated or predictable information but not new information. Our study distinguished what was new or old for speakers from what was new or old for (and shared with) addressees. In 20 groups of 3 naive participants, speakers retold the same Road Runner cartoon story twice to one addressee and once to another. We compared the distribution of gesture types, and the gestures' size and iconic precision across retellings. Speakers gestured less frequently in stories retold to Old Addressees than New Addressees. Moreover, the gestures they produced in stories retold to Old Addressees were smaller and less precise than those retold to New Addressees, although these were attenuated over time as well. Consistent with our previous findings about speaking, gesturing is guided by both speaker-based (cognitive) and addressee-based (communicative) constraints that affect both planning and motoric execution. We discuss the implications for models of co-speech gesture production.

Although multiple-observations within units in an undergraduate medical education curriculum foster more reliable scores, that evaluation design is not always practically feasible. Thus, this study investigated the overall reliability of a tutorial-based program of assessment, namely the Tutotest-Lite. Methods: More specifically, scores from multiple units were used to profile clinical domains for the first two years of a system-based PBL curriculum. Results: G-Study analysis revealed an acceptable level of generalizability, with g-coefficients of 0.84 and 0.83 for Years 1 and 2, respectively. Interestingly, D-Studies suggested that as few as five observations over one year would yield sufficiently reliable scores. Conclusions: Overall, the results from this study support the use of the Tutotest-Lite to judge clinical domains over different PBL units.

J	Burger, J				Burger, J			Fishing and risk along the Savannah river: Possible intervention	JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A			English	Article							SPORT-CAUGHT FISH; EXPOSURE; CONSUMPTION; PERCEPTION; MERCURY; ADVISORIES; COMMUNITY; FISHERMEN; POLITICS; HAZARDS	Fishing is often perceived as an enjoyable activity, and eating fish is viewed as safe and healthful. However, with recent increases in consumption advisories because of contamination, the public is faced with whether to eat fish or not. In this article I examine the knowledge base of people fishing along the Savannah River, where South Carolina has issued consumption advisories because of mercury and radionuclides. Over 250 people fishing from the Augusta lock and dam to south of the Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS) were interviewed from early April until late November 1997. Overall 82% of the fishermen thought the fish were safe to eat, even though 62% had heard some warnings about eating the fish. There were significant differences in whether people thought the fish were safe to eat as a function of income, age, education, and whether they were employed at the Savannah River Site. Significantly more fishermen thought the fish were safe who made more than $20,000/year, were over 34 yr of age, worked at SRS, and had no college or technical training, compared to others. Significantly fewer blacks had heard of consumption advisories than whites, fewer low-income people had heard, and fewer people who had not worked at SRS had heard, compared to others. Most people heard about the advisories from television, newspapers, and other people, although more blacks than whites heard about advisories from the radio. There were a/so significant ethnic differences in distance traveled, and in whether specific fish were frozen for later consumption. These data can be used to design an information program to target the people who may be most at risk from eating fish obtained from the Savannah River.

J	Olsen, O				Olsen, Ole			When general practitioners meet new evidence: an exploratory ethnographic study	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH CARE			English	Article						Evidence-based medicine; decision-making; patient-physician communication; interdisciplinary communication; home childbirth; family practice; qualitative research	EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE; INTERVENTION; MINDLINES; TIME	Objective: To explore how general practitioners (GPs) think and act when presented with new evidence in relation to planned home birth and a proposal to change information practices. Design: Exploratory ethnographic study of GPs. The GPs were encountered one or more times during a two-year period, 2011-2013, while the author tried to set up formal focus group interviews. Dialogues about the evidence, personal experiences, values and other issues unavoidably occurred. Field notes were written concomitantly. Setting: Danish GPs, primarily in Copenhagen. Subjects: Fifty Danish GPs. Results: The GPs reacted very differently, both spontaneously and later. Spontaneous reactions were often emotional involving private and professional experiences whereas later reactions were more influenced by rational deliberations. Approximately half the GPs (n = 18) who were asked whether they would personally hand out the local information leaflet about home birth were prepared to do so. The time lag between presentation of the evidence and the GPs' decision to hand out the leaflets was up to one and a half year. Conclusions: A significant number of GPs were prepared to change their information practices. However, for many GPs, the new evidence challenged previous perceptions, and ample time and resources for dialogue, deliberations and adaptation to local circumstances were required to accommodate change.

Use of telemedicine for initial outpatient subspecialist consultative visit: A national survey of general pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists	HEALTHCARE-THE JOURNAL OF DELIVERY SCIENCE AND INNOVATION			English	Article						Telemedicine; Telehealth; Referral; Subspecialty; Electronic consultation	CARE; REFERRALS; PROGRAM; COSTS	Background: Evidence-based strategies are needed to support appropriate use of telemedicine for initial outpatient subspecialty consultative visits. To inform such strategies we performed a survey of general pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists about use of telemedicine for patients newly referred for pediatric subspecialty care. Methods: We developed and fielded an e-mail and postal survey of a national sample of 840 general pediatricians and 840 pediatric subspecialists in May and June 2020. Results: Of 266 completed surveys (17% response rate), 204 (76%) thought telemedicine should be offered for some and 29 (11%) thought telemedicine should be offered for all initial subspecialist visits. Most respondents who indicated telemedicine should be offered for some initial consultations believed this decision should be made by subspecialty attendings (176/204, 86%). Respondents prioritized several data elements to inform this decision, including clinical information and family-based contextual information (e.g., barriers to in-person care, interest in telemedicine, potential communication barriers). Factors perceived to reduce appropriateness of telemedicine for subspecialty consultation included need for interpreter services and prior history of frequent noshows. Responses from generalists and subspecialists rarely differed significantly. Conclusions: Survey results suggest potential opportunities to support the appropriate use of telemedicine for initial outpatient pediatric subspecialty visits through structured transfer of specific clinical and contextual information at the time of referral and through strategies to mitigate perceived communication or engagement barriers. Implication: Pediatric physician beliefs about telemedicine for initial outpatient subspecialty consultative visits may inform future interventions to support appropriate telemedicine use.

The Utility of MMPI-2-RF Scale Scores in the Differential Diagnosis of Schizophrenia and Major Depressive Disorder	JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT			English	Article							CLINICAL RC SCALES; PSYCHIATRIC-INPATIENTS; VALIDITY SCALES; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; PERSONALITY; TEMPERAMENT; ANHEDONIA; MODEL; MMPI	This study was designed to determine whether scores on selected Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) scales could be used to differentiate between individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD). The sample was drawn from 2 psychiatric inpatient hospitals and included data from 199 individuals with SCZ and 808 individuals with MDD. A series of multivariate analyses of variance, analyses of variance, and odds ratios were calculated to determine which MMPI-2-RF scales provide the best differentiation between individuals presenting with these 2 disorders. Results indicated scales assessing internalizing dysfunction, including Emotional/Internalizing Dysfunction (EID), Restructured Clinical Scales Demoralization (RCd), Low Positive Emotions (RC2), Suicidal/Death Ideation (SUI), and Self Doubt (SFD) best discriminated MDD from SCZ. Scales assessing thought dysfunction, incluidng Thought Dysfunction (THD), Restructured Clinical Scales Ideas of Persecution (RC6) and Aberrant Experiences (RC8), and Psychoticism-Revised (PSYC-r) were demonstrated to best identify SCZ. Comparisons of the examined MMPI-2-RF scales to MMPI-2 scales assessing similar constructs suggested scales from the MMPI-2-RF perform similarly to their MMPI-2 counterparts in detecting MDD or SCZ, but might have increased ability to discriminate SCZ from other conditions. Overall, results of this study suggest that scores on the examined MMPI-2-RF scales provide important information about the differential diagnosis of MDD and SCZ to clinicians working in inpatient settings.

Novel Computerized Health Risk Appraisal May Improve Longitudinal Health and Wellness in Primary Care	APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Health risk appraisal; health information technology; goal-directed care; prioritization; wellness	TRANSLATION; MEDICINE	Objectives: Health Risk Appraisals (HRAs) have been implemented in a variety of settings, however few studies have examined the impact of computerized HRAs systematically in primary care. The study aimed at the development and pilot testing of a novel, comprehensive HRA tool in primary care practices. Methods: We designed, implemented and pilot tested a novel, web-based HRA tool in four pair-matched intervention and control primary care practices (N = 200). Outcomes were measured before and 12 months after the intervention using the HRA, patient surveys, and qualitative feedback. Intervention patients received detailed feedback from the HRA and they were encouraged to discuss the HRA report at their next wellness visit in order to develop a personalized wellness plan. Results: Estimated life expectancy and its derivatives, including Real Age and Wellness Score were significantly impacted by the HRA implementation (P<0.001). The overall rate of 10 preventive maneuvers improved by 4.2% in the intervention group vs. control (P = 0.001). The HRA improved the patient-centeredness of care, measured by the CAHPS PCC-10 survey (P = 0.05). HRA use was strongly associated with better self-rated overall health (OR = 4.94; 95% CI, 3.85-6.36) and improved up-to-dateness for preventive services (OR = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.12-1.32). A generalized linear model suggested that increase in Wellness Score was associated with improvements in patient-centeredness of care, up-to-dateness for preventive services and being in the intervention group (all P<0.03). Patients were satisfied with their HRA-experience, found the HRA report relevant and motivating and thought that it increased their health awareness. Clinicians emphasized that the HRA tool helped them and their patients converge on high-impact, evidence-based preventive measures. Conclusions: Despite study limitations, results suggest that a comprehensive, web-based, and goal-directed HRA tool can improve the receipt of preventive services, patient-centeredness of care, behavioral health outcomes, and various wellness indicators in primary care settings.

The performance of the legacy electric network can be enhanced by solving optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) problems such as, tuning of the grid voltages, transformers tap setting, capacitor bank rating, allocation and sizing of flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) through computational intelligence tools. In last few decades, several optimization strategies are developed to solve ORPD problems but still research is in progress to leverage the performance of power system. In this line of thought, this paper provides a comprehensive literature of major optimization tools designed for the solution of ORPD problems with aim of improving the power system performance. The purpose of this study is to document up to date information on the optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD), ORPD incorporating FACTS, mathematical model of ORPD problems with corresponding constraints, mathematical model of FACTS in ORPD, and applications of ORPD. At the end, a new computational tool based on fractional calculus has also been introduced for performance improvement of traditional swarming techniques to support researchers in field of energy/power sector and carry out further research.

Inevitably, natural randomness exists in the psychological perception of schizophrenic patients, which is our primary source of inspiration for this research because true randomness is the indubitably ultimate valuable resource for symmetric cryptography. Famous information theorist Claude Shannon gave two desirable properties that a strong encryption algorithm should have, which are confusion and diffusion in his fundamental article on the theoretical foundations of cryptography. Block encryption strength against various cryptanalysis attacks is purely dependent on its confusion property, which is gained through the confusion component. In the literature, chaos and algebraic techniques are extensively used to design the confusion component. Chaos- and algebraic-based techniques provide favorable features for the design of the confusion component; however, researchers have also identified potential attacks on these techniques. Instead of existing schemes, we introduce a novel methodology to construct cryptographic confusion component from the natural randomness, which are existing in the psychological perception of the schizophrenic patients, and as a result, cryptanalysis of chaos and algebraic techniques are not applicable on our proposed technique. The psychological perception of the brain regions was captured through the electroencephalogram (EEG) readings during the sensory task. The proposed design passed all the standard evaluation criteria and validation tests of the confusion component and the random number generators. One million true random bits are assessed through the NIST statistical test suite, and the results proved that the psychological perception of schizophrenic patients is a good source of true randomness. Furthermore, the proposed confusion component attains better or equal cryptographic strength as compared to state-of-the-art techniques (2020 to 2021). To the best of our knowledge, this nature of research is performed for the first time, in which psychiatric disorder is utilized for the design of information security primitive. This research opens up new avenues in cryptographic primitive design through the fusion of computing, neuroscience, and mathematics.

An important challenge in the age of Internet business is to fine-tune the Internet business system with customers. For this alignment, this paper proposes a scenario-based object-oriented methodology for developing a community web site. The methodology consists of five phases such as customer analysis, value analysis, web design, implementation design, and construction. Scenarios are used to analyze customers' needs in a natural fashion. A meta-data scheme is proposed for supporting our methodology. A real-life community web is illustrated to demonstrate the usefulness of the methodology. Scenario thinking can help companies use the Internet to buttress and extend their values.

Film thickness and etched profiles are commonly characterized by postprocess and/or destructive techniques such as cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy. Because of its sensitivity and compatibility with plasma processing environments, in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry has become an extremely useful diagnostic for plasma etching applications, but until recently it was thought to require a sacrificial, unpatterned area on the wafer to provide film thickness information. We show that the applications of ellipsometry in microelectronics are no longer restricted to the control of uniform films or to unpatterned areas dedicated to film thickness measurement but extend also to monitoring the etching of multilayer stacks during the fabrication of submicrometer devices or gratings with high aspect ratios. Some new interpretation models are developed and presented.

Visualizing disaster attitudes resulting from terrorist activities	APPLIED ERGONOMICS			English	Article						Disaster; Terrorism; Human factors	COLLECTIVE TRAUMA; SEPTEMBER-11; VALIDATION; BEHAVIOR; EMOTION; ATTACKS; RISKS; MEDIA; FEAR	The purpose of this study was to analyze people's attitudes to disasters by investigating how people feel, behave and think during disasters. We focused on disasters induced by humans, such as terrorist attacks. Two types of textual information were collected - from Internet blogs and from research papers. The analysis enabled forecasting of attitudes for the design of proactive disaster advisory scheme. Text was analyzed using a text mining tool, Leximancer. The outcome of this analysis revealed core themes and concepts in the text concerning people's attitudes. The themes and concepts were sorted into three broad categories: Affect, Behaviour, and Cognition (ABC), and the data was visualized in semantic maps. The maps reveal several knowledge pathways of ABC for developing attitudinal ontologies, which describe the relations between affect, behaviour and cognition, and the sequence in which they develop. Clearly, terrorist attacks induced trauma and people became highly vulnerable. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society. All rights reserved.

Experiences of nursing students participating in end-of-life education programs: A systematic review and qualitative metasynthesis	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Review						Terminal care; Nursing students; Palliative care; Social skills; Systematic review	SIMULATED CLINICAL-EXPERIENCE; DYING PATIENTS; COMMUNICATION; PERCEPTIONS; INTEGRATION; ATTITUDES	Objective: The aim of this review was to explore the experiences of nursing students participating in end-of-life education programs. Design: A systematic review. Data sources: Exhaustive literature searches were performed using seven electronic databases: Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, Dialnet Plus, Eric and Cuiden Plus. Review methods: In total, 6572 studies published from 2008 until 2018 were examined. The Critical Appraisal Skills Program was used to assess the quality of the studies included in the review. The findings were synthesized using meta-aggregation. Results: Seventeen studies were included in this systematic review, representing a sample of 606 nursing students. Simulation methods were most common among the educational programs analyzed. The analysis of qualitative data allowed us to identify 260 illustrations which were grouped into 14 categories and three themes: feelings and emotions during the performance of the pedagogical activity, end-of-life education among nursing students and competencies acquired on death and end-of-life. The most highlighted communication skills were learning to listen and building confidence to speak with the patient, family and the general public. Conclusions: End-of-life programs generally helped students acquire communication skills, learn concepts and improve the administration of this type of care. In addition, they perceived the experience as an opportunity to learn more about oneself, gain trust and support critical thinking. Nonetheless, the evidence available in this field is limited due to the small number of studies, plus the limited data reported. Thus, further studies on this subject are necessary.

Although this transformation is thought to rely on cooperation of multiple metal sites, molecular-level information on the reaction mechanism has remained scarce to date. Here, we report the DFT studies of the ring cleavage and contraction, of benzene by a molecular trinuclear titanium hydride cluster. Our studies suggest that the reaction is initiated by benzene coordination, followed by H-2 release, C6H6 hydrometalation, repeated C-C and C-H bond cleavage and formation to give a MeC5H4, unit, and insertion of a Ti atom into the MeC5H4 unit with release of H-2 to give a metallacycle product. The C-C bond cleavage and ring contraction of toluene can also occur in a similar fashion, though some details are different due to the presence of the methyl substituent. Obviously, the facile release of H-2 from the metal hydride cluster to provide electrons and to alter the charge population at the metal centers, in combination with the flexible metal-hydride connections and dynamic redox behavior of the trimetallic framework, has enabled this unusual transformation to occur. This work has not only provided :unprecedented insights into the activation and transformation of benzene over a multimetallic framework but it may also offer help in the design of new molecular catalysts for the activation and transformation Of inactive aromatics:	[Kang, Xiaohui; Luo, Gen; Luo, Lun; Luo, Yi; Hou, Zhaomin] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Pharmaceut Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Fine Chem, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Luo, Gen; Hu, Shaowei; Hou, Zhaomin] RIKEN, RIKEN Ctr Sustainable Resource Sci, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Luo, Gen; Hu, Shaowei; Hou, Zhaomin] RIKEN, Organometall Chem Lab, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan	Dalian University of Technology; RIKEN; RIKEN	Luo, Y; Hou, ZM (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Pharmaceut Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Fine Chem, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.; Hou, ZM (corresponding author), RIKEN, RIKEN Ctr Sustainable Resource Sci, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.; Hou, ZM (corresponding author), RIKEN, Organometall Chem Lab, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.	luoyi@dlut.edu.cn; houz@riken.jp	Hu, Shaowei/C-7982-2017; Luo, Yi/B-3277-2013; Luo, Lun/N-4555-2019; Hou, Zhaomin/I-5981-2014; Luo, Gen/C-8149-2017; Luo, Lun/F-4079-2017	Luo, Yi/0000-0001-6390-8639; Luo, Lun/0000-0002-8361-4547; Luo, Gen/0000-0002-5297-6756; Luo, Lun/0000-0002-8361-4547; Hu, Shaowei/0000-0002-7209-438X	National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21174023, 21429201]; Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS) [26220802]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26220802] Funding Source: KAKEN	National Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))	This work was partly supported by grants (Nos. 21174023, 21429201) from the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S) (No. 26220802) from the Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS).

Methods: A close-ended questionnaire was developed based on literature and discussions among the research group members. The questionnaire contained a -total of 33 questions, which were divided into 4 categories - demographics, knowledge assessment, concerns related to participation, and opinions on disclosure of information. Majority of the participants (250 out of 281) of a nutrigenetic study, in which effect of disclosing APOE allele status on lifestyle changes was studied, completed the questionnaire online following the informed consent process. The responses from the knowledge assessment and the concern categories were transformed into knowledge and concern scales, respectively, and analysed by descriptive statistical methods. The statistical associations between the categorical variables were determined using chi(2) test of independence. The relationship between the continuous variables was assessed using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and internal consistency of questions by Cronbach's alpha. Results: No correlation was observed between the level of education and knowledge scores. About 10% of the participants thought that the genetic predisposition would be stressful to them and their family members. Conclusions: Careful distribution of information before a nutrigenetic study supports understanding and reduces concerns of genetic susceptibility. In Finland, strong basic education is likely to have strengthened the trust in research process.

Design and Methods This cross-sectional study was remotely conducted using General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and personnel information form, for 2630 nursing students, in Turkey. Data were statistically analyzed. Findings The mean GHQ-12 score was 3.04 +/- 2.13, and 71.5% of nursing students scored >= 2 on the GHQ-12, indicating risk for mental problems. We highlighted that nursing students who reported less sleep and diet during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as those who thought they were suffering from COVID-19 symptoms obtained significantly higher mean scores on the GHQ-12. Practice Implications Our results showed that most nursing students reported mental problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-training of the frontline staff during outbreaks is needed to prepare them to deal with a global pandemic.

Modelling Ethical Algorithms in Autonomous Vehicles Using Crash Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Autonomous vehicles; ethics; crash data; safety	TROLLEY; DILEMMA	In this paper we provide a proof of principle of a new method for addressing the ethics of autonomous vehicles (AVs), the Data-Theories Method, in which vehicle crash data is combined with philosophical ethical theory to provide a guide to action for AV algorithm design. We use this method to model three scenarios in which an AV is exposed to risk on the road, and determine possible actions for the AV. We then examine how different philosophical perspectives on agent partiality, or the degree to which one can act in one's own self-interest, might address each scenario. This method shows why modelling the ethics of AVs using data is essential. First, AVs may sometimes have options that human drivers do not, and designing AVs to mimic the most ethical human driver would not ensure that they do the right thing. Second, while ethical theories can often disagree about what should he done, disagreement can be reduced and compromises found with a more complete understanding of the AV's choices and their consequences. Finally, framing problems around thought experiments may elicit preferences that are divergent with what individuals might prefer once they are provided with information about the real risks for a scenario. Our method provides a principled and empirical approach to productively address these problems and offers guidance on AV algorithm design.	[Robinson, Pamela; Phillips, Christopher R.

In addition to being a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, it was thought to act through other mechanisms such as antioxidation, antiapoptosis, etc. However, the molecular targets involved with these mechanisms were not identified. In this study, we attempted to exam the interactome of Huperzine A using a cDNA phage display library and also mammalian brain tissue extracts. The drugs were chemically linked on the surface of magnetic particles and the interactive phages or proteins were collected and analyzed. Among the various cDNA expressing phages selected, one was identified to encode the mitochondria NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1. Specific bindings between the drug and the target phages and target proteins were confirmed. Another enriched phage clone was identified as mitochondria ATP synthase, which was also panned out from the proteome of mouse brain tissue lysate. These data indicated the possible involvement of mitochondrial respiratory chain matrix enzymes in Huperzine A's pharmacological effects. Such involvement had been suggested by previous studies based on enzyme activity changes. Our data supported the new mechanism. Overall we demonstrated the feasibility of using magnetic biopanning as a simple and viable method for investigating the complex molecular mechanisms of bioactive molecules.

This line of thinking, which involves deriving land use limits from infrastructure capacity, requires solving the inverse of the typical transportation planning problem. Modular artificial neural networks (ANNs) were developed for solving the inverse transportation planning problem. ANNs were designed to predict zonal trip ends, given the traffic volumes on the links of the transportation network. Computational experiments were performed to study the effect on ANN accuracy of three factors: transportation network size, variability in training data, and ANN topology. ANNs were shown to be quite capable of capturing the relationship between link volumes and zonal trip ends for both small and medium-sized transportation networks and for degrees of variability in the training data. Modular ANNs with one or two hidden layers appeared to outperform other ANN topologies.

J	May, C				May, Carl			Towards a general theory of implementation	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article							HEALTH TECHNOLOGY-ASSESSMENT; CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINES; COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; CARE; DIFFUSION; MODEL; WORK; TELEMEDICINE; FRAMEWORK	Understanding and evaluating the implementation of complex interventions in practice is an important problem for healthcare managers and policy makers, and for patients and others who must operationalize them beyond formal clinical settings. It has been argued that this work should be founded on theory that provides a foundation for understanding, designing, predicting, and evaluating dynamic implementation processes. This paper sets out core constituents of a general theory of implementation, building on Normalization Process Theory and linking it to key constructs from recent work in sociology and psychology. These are informed by ideas about agency and its expression within social systems and fields, social and cognitive mechanisms, and collective action. This approach unites a number of contending perspectives in a way that makes possible a more comprehensive explanation of the implementation and embedding of new ways of thinking, enacting and organizing practice.

Mutations in a large number of genes, including SOD1, C9ORF72, TARDBP, FUS, VAPB, VCP, UBQLN2, ALS2, SETX, OPTN, ANG, and SPG11, are thought to cause ALS, whereas others, including ATAXN2, GRN, HFE, NEFH, UNC13A, and VEGF, appear to be disease-modifying genes. Epigenetic influences may also play important roles. An improved understanding of ALS genetics should lead to better trial designs, insights into common molecular pathways, and better characterization of preclinical models. New genetic sequencing techniques, which use high-throughput methods to assess variants across the genome or exome, may facilitate rational patient stratification for clinical trials and permit more individualized prognostic information and treatment decisions in clinical care.

These assessments occur pre-placement, then every 5?years to age 50, then every 2?years to age 60, and then every year. Despite some reported benefits to rail workforce health indicators since implementation, research suggests the assessments are not operating as effectively as they might. For example, the prevalence of obesity in drivers is higher than in the general population and continues to increase. To improve this, there is a need to understand the experiences of drivers undergoing workplace health assessments. The aims of this study were to examine train drivers perceptions and experiences of the assessments, understand how these experiences shape their engagement with the process, and to generate recommendations for improvement from a systems thinking perspective. A qualitative design was used, involving semi-structured interviews within five focus groups of train drivers (n?=?29) held across four Australian rail organisations. Questions addressed drivers backgrounds, their understanding of the National Standard, experiences of and attitudes towards health assessments, lifestyle risk factors, and personal approach to health and wellbeing. Transcript data were subjected to thematic analysis. Five factors were identified: drivers unmet information needs, perceived low reliability and validity of assessment, need for psychological wellbeing assessment and support, maladaptive threat avoidance strategies, and focus on short-term outcomes and compliance. The global theme was reactive organisational culture. Findings suggest that driver engagement with health assessment can be improved by proactively addressing the identified factors in occupational health initiatives and preventative interventions to tackle the burgeoning problem of train driver health impairment.

We thought interesting to verify the suitability of a modified cellulose biofilm filled with halloysite nanotubes as wax compatibilizers to design a protecting layer. A hydraulic mortar was selected as a stone prototype. To improve the physicochemical properties of the covering layer, wax microparticles have been incorporated to control transport, consolidation and wettability features. In particular, different application protocols have been studied, namely brushing and spraying, to assess whether the proposed procedures can be scaled up. Colorimetric analysis has been carried out to evidence the applicability in terms of color alteration after the treatment. Water adhesion was investigated by measuring the contact angle values as a function of time to obtain information on spreading and adsorption phenomena. These physico-chemical properties have been correlated to the microstructure evidenced by both electron and optical microscopies. [GRAPHICS] .

Second-year veterinary students working in small collaborative learning groups used the program prior to their weekly pathology laboratory. The goals of ATLes were to better address specific learning objectives in the course (notably the appreciation of pathophysiology), to solve previously identified problems associated with information overload and information sorting that commonly occur as part of discovery-based processes, and to enhance classroom discussion. The program was also designed to model and allow students to practice the problem-oriented approach to clinical cases, thereby enabling them to study pathology in a relevant clinical context. Features included opportunities for students to obtain additional information on the case by requesting specific laboratory tests and/or diagnostic procedures. However, students were also required to justify their diagnostic plans and to provide mechanistic analyses. The use of ATLes met most of these objectives. Student acceptance was high, and students favorably reviewed the online "Content Links" that made useful information more readily accessible and level appropriate. Students came to the lab better prepared to engage in an in-depth and high-quality discussion and were better able to connect clinical problems to underlying changes in tissue (lesions). However, many students indicated that the required time on task prior to lab might have been excessive relative to what they thought they learned. The classroom discussion, although improved, was not elevated to the expected level-most likely reflecting other missing elements of the learning environment, including the existing student culture and the students' current discussion skills. This article briefly discusses the lessons learned from ATLes and how similar case-based exercises might be combined with other approaches to enhance and enliven classroom discussions in the veterinary curriculum.

A public meeting on "Drug Interactions With Hormonal Contraceptives: Public Health and Drug Development Implication" was hosted by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The meeting endeavored to provide an opportunity for the FDA to seek input from experts on the public health concerns associated with the use of hormonal contraceptives and interacting drugs that might affect efficacy and safety, including pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic considerations, in the design of drug interaction studies of hormonal contraceptives for drug development and approaches to translating the results of drug interaction information into informative labeling and communication. The input received could be used to refine FDA's thinking on hormonal contraceptives drug interaction study design and interpretation and labeling communication of drug interaction risk.

However, as a typical short text, microblogging filtering suffers from the insufficient samples problem that makes the probabilisticlike models unreliable. According to the current research, an explicit brief query has been thought to be only an abstract of the user's information needs, and it's hard to infer what is the users' actual searching intents. Instead, we submit the relevant external documents as a user's implicit prior knowledge and then build a corresponding filtering framework. To against the risk of external documents expansion, we suppose the external document can be viewed as a complete statement of an explicit query, and encode the filtering preferences with the diverge degree between the external document and the the original explicit query. Thus the optimal filtering action is the one that allows one to trade off diverge degree against generalization performance. With respect to the established baselines, our algorithm yields compelling results for providing a meaningful tweets retrieval. This work helps further understand the innate risk characteristics of external expansion for the design of Microblogging filtering systems.

Insights into the Structure-Activity Relationships in Metal-Organic Framework-Supported Nickel Catalysts for Ethylene Hydrogenation	ACS CATALYSIS			English	Article						ethylene hydrogenation; support effect; Zr- and Hf-based MOFs; nickel catalyst; computational analysis	GENERALIZED GRADIENT APPROXIMATION; INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; BASIS-SETS; TRANSITION; EFFICIENT; METHANE	Solid supports play an indispensable role in heterogeneous catalysis, as they can directly affect the catalytic activity and selectivity of supported catalysts. However, the specific roles of such supports remain to be demystified owing to the difficulties in obtaining precise structural information on supported catalysts. To understand the effects of MOF topology, pore environment, and metal identity of node supports on the catalytic activity, a Ni catalyst was supported on eight Zr- or Hf-MOFs based on 8-connected nodes: namely M-NU-1200, M-NU-1000, M-NU-1008, and M-NU-1010 (M = Zr, Hf). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to characterize the supported catalyst structures. To investigate the support effects on their activities, the supported Ni catalysts were evaluated by using ethylene hydrogenation as a model reaction. The results revealed that all Hf-based-MOF-supported Ni catalysts exhibited higher catalytic reactivity with TOF (turnover frequency) values at least double of those isostructural Zr counterparts. Additionally, MOFs with less congested metal anchoring sites, as a result of the topology and surrounding pore environment, yielded higher TOFs, suggesting the importance of supports in dictating both the catalyst accessibility and activity. Computational analysis complemented the experimental observations and provided insights into reaction barrier differences and their performance variation. This study demonstrates the essential role of the supports and provides a thought for selecting/designing suitable supports in heterogeneous catalysis.

An "enamel pearl" is an ectopic globule of enamel that is adherent to the tooth root surface. Such an anomaly may facilitate the progression of periodontal breakdown. information on the prevalence of enamel pearls is sparse, and ethnic variations are thought to occur. Our objective was to assess the prevalence of enamel pearls in a group of Jordanian dental patients. Study design. A random sample of 819 dental records were selected, and a total of 1032 periapical radiographs were interpreted for the presence of enamel pearls. Results, Enamel pearls were detected in 4.76% of the subjects and on 1.6% of the molars. No significant difference between sexes was observed. First molar teeth were the most commonly affected, whereas the third molars were the least affected with the condition. Conclusions. Enamel pearls are not uncommon among Jordanian dental patients, and their early detection could be important in prevention of periodontal disease.

Exploring and supporting older women's chemotherapy decision-making in early-stage breast cancer	JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Breast cancer; Chemotherapy; Decision-making; Shared decision-making; Geriatric oncology; Qualitative design	OF-MEDICINE REPORT; CARE; ADULTS	Background: Few studies have focused on the therapeutic decision-making process in older adults with breast cancer. This study investigated older adult breast cancer patients' perspectives on neo/adjuvant chemotherapy, thereby identifying informational needs and preferences as patients navigate the treatment decision-making process. Materials and methods: Women >_65 years diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer were recruited from an academic cancer center after deciding whether or not to receive neo/adjuvant chemotherapy. Participants completed surveys assessing sociodemographic characteristics, health literacy/numeracy, and shared decision making. They took part in individual semi-structured interviews to explore their perspectives, experiences, and values regarding treatment. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed using the Sort and Sift, Think and Shift qualitative approach. Quantitative data was summarized using descriptive statistics. Results: Of the 26 participants (age range 65-92 years; 81% non-Hispanic White; 72% >_ college degree; 50% unmarried), 58% elected to undergo chemotherapy and 42% declined. The majority of participants had adequate health literacy/numeracy and engaged in shared decision-making. Thematic analysis revealed several commonalities regardless of the decision to undergo chemotherapy. Participants sought information regarding their disease/treatment. They referenced subjective experiences of friends/family members with cancer. Self-perception of health and the side effects of chemotherapy were also key factors. Participants placed importance on the maintenance of quality of life throughout treatment. Conclusions: Decision-making strategies in older patients were shaped by knowledge, values, and the anecdotal experiences of others. Results can inform the development of decision support tools for older patients and physicians to better facilitate the shared decision-making process. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Larrain, N; Groene, O				Larrain, Nicolas; Groene, Oliver			Simulation modeling to assess performance of integrated healthcare systems: Literature review to characterize the field and visual aid to guide model selection	PLOS ONE			English	Review							DISCRETE-EVENT SIMULATION; POPULATION HEALTH; DYNAMICS MODEL; PUBLIC-HEALTH; DELIVERY; IMPACT; MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES	Background The guiding principle of many health care reforms is to overcome fragmentation of service delivery and work towards integrated healthcare systems. Even though the value of integration is well recognized, capturing its drivers and its impact as part of health system performance assessment is challenging. The main reason is that current assessment tools only insufficiently capture the complexity of integrated systems, resulting in poor impact estimations of the actions taken towards the 'Triple Aim'. We describe the unique nature of simulation modeling to consider key health reform aspects: system complexity, optimization of actions, and long-term assessments. Research question How can the use and uptake of simulation models be characterized in the field of performance assessment of integrated healthcare systems? Methods A systematic search was conducted between 2000 and 2018, in 5 academic databases (ACM D. Library, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Web of Science) complemented with grey literature from Google Scholar. Studies using simulation models with system thinking to assess system performance in topics relevant to integrated healthcare were selected for revision. Results After screening 2274 articles, 30 were selected for analysis. Five modeling techniques were characterized, across four application areas in healthcare. Complexity was defined in nine aspects, embedded distinctively in each modeling technique. 'What if?' & 'How to?' scenarios were identified as methods for system optimization. The mean time frame for performance assessments was 18 years. Conclusions Simulation models can evaluate system performance emphasizing the complex relations between components, understanding the system's adaptability to change in short or long-term assessments. These advantages position them as a useful tool for complementing performance assessment of integrated healthcare systems in their pursuit of the 'Triple Aim'. Besides literacy in modeling techniques, accurate model selection is facilitated after identification and prioritization of the complexities that rule system performance. For this purpose, a tool for selecting the most appropriate simulation modeling techniques was developed.

Minimal residual disease (MRD), defined as the persistence of leukemic cells after chemotherapy treatment, is thought to be the major cause of relapse. The origins of relapse in AML have been traced to rare therapy-resistant leukemic stem cells ( LSCs) that are already present at diagnosis. Effective treatment strategies for longterm remission are lacking, as it has been difficult to eliminate LSCs with conventional therapy. Here, we proposed a new approach based on the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-directed T lymphocytes, targeting T-cell immunoglobulin, and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) to treat MRD in patients with AML. TIM-3 is selected as the target because it is highly expressed on AML blasts and LSCs in most subtypes regardless of the patient's genetic characteristics and treatment course. Moreover, it is absent in the normal hematopoietic stem cells, granulocytes, naive lymphocytes, and most normal nonhematopoietic tissues. Using a naive human Fab phage display library, we isolated an anti-human TIM-3 antibody and designed a second- generation anti-TIM-3. Our anti-TIM-3 CAR T cells exhibit potent anti-leukemic activity against AML cell lines and primary AML blasts, and in the mouse models. More importantly, we demonstrate efficient killing of the primary LSCs directly isolated from the patients. Hence, eradication of the LSCs present in the MRD by anti-TIM-3 CAR T-cell therapy following the first-line treatment may improve the clinical outcomes of patients with AML.

The following qualitative study documents the collection and analysis of group interaction data in an astronomy sky simulation across AR and tablet technologies in a classroom setting. A total of 15 groups were coded for episodes of on-task problem-solving, conceptual engagement, and use of gesture. Analysis of coded interactions assisted in identifying vignettes facilitating exploration, orientation, perspective sharing, and communication of mental models. In addition, the use of gesture by some groups enabled the creation of shared situated conceptual spaces, bridging the AR and tablet experiences and facilitating collaborative exchange of spatial information. The patterns of gesture and collaborative knowledge interactions documented here have implications for the design of future collaborative learning environments leveraging extended reality technologies.

J	Li, Y; Lu, XZ; Guan, H; Ying, MJ; Yan, WM				Li, Yi; Lu, Xinzheng; Guan, Hong; Ying, Mingjian; Yan, Weiming			A Case Study on a Fire-Induced Collapse Accident of a Reinforced Concrete Frame-Supported Masonry Structure	FIRE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Frame-supported masonry structure; Fire-induced collapse; Site investigation; Numerical simulation	PROGRESSIVE COLLAPSE; STEEL STRUCTURES; RESISTANCE; BUILDINGS; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN; COLUMNS; CALCULATE; TOWERS; BEAMS	In 2003, an 8-storey reinforced concrete (RC) frame-supported masonry structure, located in Hengyang City, China, underwent a severe fire-induced collapse accident. Information on the structure and the fire scenario is presented. It includes the design data, the site observation record of the fire incident, and the laboratory material test results. Preliminary investigation reveals that about 45.9% of the bottom storey of the RC frame experienced temperatures in excess of 800A degrees C, and its central area reached 1300A degrees C. Such a severe fire load, of fairly high temperature and large area, is thought to be the primary cause of the progressive collapse of the entire building structure. To better understand the collapse mechanism, this study presents a coupled thermo-mechanical numerical simulation of the building collapse. The actual collapse area is well reproduced by the proposed numerical model. The simulation further demonstrates that the initial damage happened to two interior columns exposed to temperature of 1300A degrees C. Such damage was also attributable to the large gravity load they carried, and the complicated nature of the local structural arrangements. The adjacent structural members were subsequently damaged, because they were also weakened by the fire, and were over-loaded by the redistributed load. Failure of the two interior columns and adjacent area eventually triggered a progressive collapse. Further, the effect of some critical factors on the collapse mechanism is discussed. On the basis of this numerical case study, practical design considerations on the key structural components, the fire compartments, and the structural robustness are given for the prevention of the fire-induced progressive collapse of RC frame structures.

J	Aunger, JA; Millar, R; Greenhalgh, J				Aunger, Justin Avery; Millar, Ross; Greenhalgh, Joanne			Modelling lifecycles of inter-organizational collaborations in healthcare: a systematic review and best-fit framework synthesis	JOURNAL OF HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Public management; Partnership; Collaboration; Health care; Social psychology	ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; PARTNERSHIP WORKING; PRIVATE-SECTOR; CAPACITY; INTEGRATION; SERVICES; ALLIANCES; KNOWLEDGE; DYNAMICS	PurposeInter-organisational collaboration (IOC) across healthcare settings has been put forward as a solution to mounting financial and sustainability challenges. Whilst ingredients for successful IOC have been explored, there remains limited understanding of the development of IOCs over time.Design/methodology/approachThe authors systematically reviewed the literature to identify models applied to IOCs in healthcare across databases such as Healthcare Management Information Consortium (HMIC) and MEDLINE, identifying 2,763 titles and abstracts with 26 final papers included. The authors then used a "best fit" framework synthesis methodology to synthesise fourteen models of IOC in healthcare and the wider public sector to formulate an applied composite model describing the process through which collaborations change over time. This synthesis comprised extracting stages and behaviours from included models, selecting an a priori framework upon which to code these stages and behaviours and then re-coding them to construct a new composite model.FindingsExisting models often did not consider that organisations may undergo many IOCs in the organisations' lifetime nor included "contemplation" stages or those analogous to "dissolution", which might negatively impact papers using such models. The formulated' composite model utilises a life-cycle design comprising five non-linear phases, namely Contemplating, Connecting, Planning, Implementation and Maintenance or Dissolution and incorporates dynamic elements from Complex Adaptive Systems thinking to reflect the dynamic nature of collaborations.Originality/valueThis is the first purpose-built model of the lifecycles of IOCs in healthcare. The model is intended to inform implementers, evaluators and researchers of IOCs alike.

Probing molecular mechanism of inhibitor bindings to bromodomain-containing protein 4 based on molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analysis	SAR AND QSAR IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Bromodomain-containing protein 4; binding free energy; molecular dynamics simulations; principal component analysis; cross-correlation maps	HIV-1 PROTEASE; FREE-ENERGY; IN-SILICO; EFFICIENT GENERATION; AM1-BCC MODEL; HISTONE H4; MM-PBSA; P-TEFB; BET; BRD4	It is well known that bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) has been thought as a promising target utilized for treating various human diseases, such as inflammatory disorders, malignant tumours, acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), bone diseases, etc. For this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding free energy calculations, and principal component analysis (PCA) were integrated together to uncover binding modes of inhibitors 8P9, 8PU, and 8PX to BRD4(1). The results obtained from binding free energy calculations show that van der Waals interactions act as the main regulator in bindings of inhibitors to BRD4(1). The information stemming from PCA reveals that inhibitor associations extremely affect conformational changes, internal dynamics, and movement patterns of BRD4(1). Residue-based free energy decomposition method was wielded to unveil contributions of independent residues to inhibitor bindings and the data signify that hydrogen bonding interactions and hydrophobic interactions are decisive factors affecting bindings of inhibitors to BRD4(1). Meanwhile, eight residues Trp81, Pro82, Val87, Leu92, Leu94, Cys136, Asn140, and Ile146 are recognized as the common hot interaction spots of three inhibitors with BRD4(1). The results from this work are expected to provide a meaningfully theoretical guidance for design and development of effective inhibitors inhibiting of the activity of BRD4.	[Wu, S. L.; Wang, L.

Participants 29 health professionals who had recently informed parents that a sex chromosome anomaly had been identified in an apparently anatomically normal, viable fetus. 23 mothers and partners who had been informed of such a diagnosis. Main outcome measures Health professionals' knowledge about sex chromosome anomalies and parents' responses to information provided by health professionals. Results Analysis of the telephone interviews identified great variation in what different healthcare professionals know, think, and say about the same sex chromosome anomaly, The small numbers and the low response rate for the questionnaire (39% for women and 30% for men) meant that statistical analysis was not appropriate. Conclusions It is essential for obstetric units to have an established protocol for giving results and for all staff who communicate results to parents to have accurate, up to date information about the condition identified.

It is a thought-provoking problem to availably employ time-varying spatial and temporal characteristics from multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Although deep learning has made remarkable achievements in emotion recognition, the biological topological information among brain regions does not fully exploit, which is vital for EEG-based emotion recognition. In response to this problem, we design a hybrid model called ST-GCLSTM, which comprises a spatial-graph convolutional network (SGCN) module and an attention-enhanced bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module. The main advantage of ST-GCLSTM is that it can consider the biological topology information of each brain region to extract representative spatial-temporal features from multiple EEG channels. Specifically, we construct two layers SGCN by introducing adjacency matrices to adaptively learn the intrinsic connection among different EEG channels. Moreover, an attention-enhanced mechanism is placed into a bi-directional LSTM module to extract the crucial spatial-temporal features from sequential EEG data, and then these features serve as the input layer of the classifier to learn discriminative emotion-related features. Extensive experiments on the DEAP, SEED, and SEED-IV datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ST-GCLSTM model, revealing that our model had an absolute performance improvement over state-of-the-art strategies.

J	Wang, J; Xu, YY; Xu, K; Wang, C				Wang, Jian; Xu, Youyun; Xu, Kui; Wang, Cong			A User Grouping Based Opportunistic Network Coding Scheme for Multi-user Multi-relay Uplink Transmissions	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Cooperative communication; Multi-user multi-relay transmissions; Opportunistic network coding; Outage probability; Throughput	COOPERATIVE DIVERSITY	In this paper, we study a User Grouping based Opportunistic Network Coding (UG-ONC) scheme for multi-user multi-relay uplink transmission scenario. In traditional opportunistic network coding (ONC) schemes, the use of network coding is often determined by the state of relays, i.e., buffer, packets waiting time, packets' successful decoding. However, whether the use of network coding is beneficial to the users is not considered. In our proposed UG-ONC scheme, whether network coding is adopted is not only determined by the state of relays, but also by the link quality between users and base station, that is, determined by the state of users. We consider two information-theoretic metrics, i.e., outage probability and throughput, to evaluate the validity and reliability of the UG-ONC scheme. And the approximate expressions of outage probability and throughput are derived. To further examine the performance of the scheme, we compare UG-ONC scheme with an existent network coding scheme. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to validate our analysis. The results show that our proposed UG-ONC scheme achieves considerable gains over the traditional network coding scheme. Our proposed UG-ONC scheme gives a new thought for designing opportunistic network coding.

Except for renal replacement therapy, no adequate treatment regimen is available; therefore studies on the treatment of renal fibrosis have attracted significant interest. In recent years, studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may represent an attractive source to produce drugs with antifibrosis effects. The aim of this study was to establish a robust cell-based high-content screening (HCS) approach to identify TCM compounds with antifibrosis effects in NRK49F cells following TGF-beta 1 exposure. When designing the model, one of the most important steps involved the stability and reproducibility of this cell-based model. Therefore, we initially optimized the experimental parameters. Then, our HCS model was validated using SB525334, an inhibitor of the TGF-beta 1 receptor, and curcumin and emodin, two TCM compounds with well-documented anti-renal fibrosis activity. Subsequently, the proven reliable HCS model was used to screen a standard TCM compound library, which included 344 TCM molecules. Based on our HCS algorithm, a total of 16 compounds were identified to have prospective inhibitory activity. These compounds were further validated by verification experiments. Strikingly, eight compounds have been shown to inhibit renal fibrosis; six of them had rarely been described in the literature, namely, Ligustrazine, Glycyrrhizic acid, Astragaloside iv, Hydroxysafflor Yellow A, Crocin, and Gypenosides. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which a HCS assay was performed to identify TCM compounds with anti-renal fibrosis effects. The HCS approach was successfully applied to screen active compounds and will be propitious to further anti-renal fibrosis drugs discovery research. Meanwhile, it may offer possibilities for identifying lead compounds for treating other diseases from registered Chinese herbal medicines.

How Nascent Occupations Construct a Mandate: The Case of Service Designers' Ethos	ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY			English	Article						occupational mandate; emerging occupations; values; work practices	DOMINANT LOGIC; WORK; IDENTITIES; WORKPLACE; DYNAMICS; STRUGGLE; POWER	In this paper, we study the way that nascent occupations constructing an occupational mandate invoke not only skills and expertise or a new technology to distinguish themselves from other occupations, but also their values. We studied service design, an emerging occupation whose practitioners aim to understand customers and help organizations develop new or improved services and customer experiences, translate those into feasible solutions, and implement them. Practitioners enacted their values in their daily work activities through a set of material practices, such as shadowing customers or front-line staff, conducting interviews in the service context, or creating "journey maps'' of a service user's experience. The role of values in the construction of an occupational mandate is particularly salient for occupations such as service design, which cannot solely rely on skills and technical expertise as sources of differentiation. We show how service designers differentiated themselves from other competing occupations by highlighting how their values make their work practices unique. Both values and work practices, what service designers call their ethos, were essential to enable service designers to define the proper conduct and modes of thinking characteristic of their occupational mandate.

Public understanding and use of antibiotics in England: findings from a household survey in 2017	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							TRACT-INFECTION; SEEKING; INFORMATION; POPULATION; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; HYGIENE; CARE	Objectives To describe public understanding and use of antibiotics. Design Ipsos MORI Capibus survey of randomly-selected households. Setting England, January-April 2017. Participants 2283 adults (>= 15 years) including 777 parents of children <5 years old. Data collection and analysis The main survey was undertaken in January 2017 (n=1691); data from an additional sample of parents were collected in April 2017 (n=592). Analyses were weighted to obtain estimates representative of the population. Main outcome measures Responses to questions about antibiotics (awareness and perceptions), recent illness (expectations and experience), delayed and leftover antibiotics, and child illness stratified by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Results Most respondents (83% (1404/1691)) recognised that antibiotics kill bacteria/treat bacterial infections, but a sizeable minority (35% (592/1691)) thought that antibiotics kill viruses/treat viral infections. Overall levels of understanding have not changed substantially since similar surveys in 2003 and 2008/2009. One sixth of respondents who were prescribed antibiotics reported having leftovers (14% (64/498)) and 33% (22/64) kept these for possible future use. 1.3% of all respondents (23/1691) reported taking left-over antibiotics in the past year and 1.6% (26/1691) reported taking antibiotics obtained without a prescription. Higher social grade and educational qualifications were strongly positively associated with antibiotic knowledge; youngest (15-24 years), oldest (65 +years) and black, Asian and minority ethnic adults were less knowledgeable. Among 1319 respondents who had an infection or antibiotics within the past year, 43% (568/1319) said that they had not received any advice or information about antibiotics. Conclusions Despite many campaigns, public understanding of antibiotics in England continues to combine correct basic knowledge held by most people with less prevalent but persistent and potentially harmful misunderstandings. These could be addressed through active provision of advice and information during primary and secondary care consultations and more effective public health interventions.	[McNulty, Cliodna A.

Improving the Reporting of Young Children's Food Intake: Insights from a Cognitive Interviewing Study with Mothers of 3-7-Year Old Children	NUTRIENTS			English	Article						child food intake; dietary intake assessment; short food questionnaire; cognitive interview; qualitative research; parent	BEHAVIORAL FREQUENCY; LOW-INCOME; QUALITATIVE METHODS; QUESTIONNAIRE; VALIDITY; ADOLESCENTS; RELIABILITY; RESPONDENTS; STRATEGIES; DESIGN	Short food questions (SFQ) allow for rapid reporting of food intake across a variety of settings but are limited by poor validity and reliability. Understanding the recall process used by parents to report children's food intake can improve question design and psychometric performance. This study aimed to improve understanding of how parents report children's dietary intake using SFQ. Semi-structured, cognitive interviews were conducted with 21 mothers of 3-7-year-old children. Mothers were asked to 'think-aloud' while answering SFQ about their child's food intake. Thematic analysis identified themes relating to parent's question and answer process and barriers to recall. Information retrieval strategies focused on 'use-of-time' and 'sphere of food provision' and differed for core versus unhealthy foods. Recall of routine and home food provision were used to report core food intake, whereas recall of special occasions and food provision outside the home guided recall of discretionary foods. Mothers utilize different recall strategies for core and discretionary foods based on use of time and the sphere of food provision. The ease of reporting children's dietary intake may be improved by utilizing a shorter recall time frame, clear and direct question wording, and use of food examples and recall prompts.

J	Giangrande, A				Giangrande, A			Biodiversity, conservation, and the 'Taxonomic impediment'	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						taxonomy; biodiversity; species richness; monitoring; experimental ecology; descriptive ecology; conservation	KEYSTONE-SPECIES CONCEPT; SPATIAL PATTERNS; STABILITY; COMMUNITY; VARIABILITY; DIVERSITY; ASSEMBLAGES; RICHNESS; ECOLOGY; ROLES	1. This paper highlights the poor esteem in which taxonomy, as autonomous science, is held and the relative implications of this for conservation biology. 2. In recent times, taxonomy at the species level has tended to be neglected not just within ecological researches, but also in the identification and justification for the selection of the marine protected areas (MPA). A traditional criterion for choosing an MPA is the conservation of biodiversity, but most of the Italian MPA were chosen without initial detailed studies on their biodiversity, so that lists of species of the main invertebrate groups are not available. 3. The identification of organisms within communities to species level is one of the greatest constraints in terms of time and costs in ecological studies. Some studies have suggested that working at a taxonomic level higher than species does not result in an important loss of information (Taxonomic sufficiency). It does, however, lead to an inaccuracy of biodiversity evaluation which is, especially important when comparing different areas, and can lead to an 'a priori' exclusion of some entities before understanding their role in ecology. 4. Taxonomy has always been considered a marginal science even during the pioneer descriptive period of ecology, and traditionally has received little financial support. The result was the production of many misidentifications and erroneous records. During recent years, the developing experimental ecological approach has led to an improvement in scientific methods, but concurrently to a reduction in the number of expert taxonomists for many invertebrate groups. Descriptive works, historically so common in the Mediterranean area, are now considered obsolete, despite having an intrinsic value. 5. Biodiversity, particularly 'species richness' has long been thought to influence temporal variability and it seems that efforts to clarify the biodiversity/temporal variability relationship or to demonstrate the lack of such a relationship should continue. Such information is essential in order to maintain the ecological function despite the loss of component species, an important topic not only to ecologists but also to policy makers. Many species appear to have overlapping niches, and as such it could be argued that it is not essential for all species to be present. In contrast the crucial role of keystone species has been embraced in conservation biology as a tool to help highlight species requiring priority for protection. 6. Present knowledge of marine systems has led to the conclusion that, before developing theories and experimental design, we need an appropriate description of the system under investigation. A basic knowledge of the general biodiversity in term of species richness of a proposed MPA for example is essential, with a detailed survey providing the taxonomic lists necessary for biotope characterization and a reference data set for future comparisons.

J	BELTON, V; ELDER, MD				BELTON, V; ELDER, MD			DECISION-SUPPORT SYSTEMS - LEARNING FROM VISUAL INTERACTIVE MODELING	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS; VISUAL INTERACTIVE MODELING; LEARNING	SIMULATION	The two research fields of, in the first instance, Decision Support Systems (DSS) and then secondly, Visual Interactive Modelling (VIM) have developed by mostly independent research. Yet these two fields seek many common goals. The VIM field has been seen as a largely technical development aiding certain Operational Research methods. On the other hand DSS have developed in the wider context of a recognition of a need to provide directed and helpful information to support decision making. In this paper we develop, firstly, an understanding of VIM in the context of current thinking on DSS. Ostensibly, it would seem that VIM is simply a DSS with a sophisticated user interface. However, we argue that VIM is an approach which has at its core an ability to allow decision makers to learn about their own subjective values while modelling technical issues. We suggest that embracing this learning objective at the design stage will enhance the power of Visual Interactive Models in particular and Decision Support Systems in general.

This predictive ability is thought to rely on mental simulations and has been shown to involve frontoparietal areas. Here, we investigate whether such mental simulations may be accompanied by visual imagery of the predicted physical scene. We designed an intuitive physical inference task requiring participants to infer the parabolic trajectory of an occluded ball falling in accordance with Newtonian physics. Participants underwent fMRI while (i) performing the physical inference task alternately with a visually matched control task, and (ii) passively observing falling balls depicting the trajectories that had to be inferred during the physical inference task. We found that performing the physical inference task activates early visual areas together with a frontoparietal network when compared with the control task. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we show that these regions contain information specific to the trajectory of the occluded ball (i.e., fall direction), despite the absence of visual inputs. Using a cross-classification approach, we further show that in early visual areas, trajectory-specific activity patterns evoked by the physical inference task resemble those evoked by the passive observation of falling balls. Together, our findings suggest that participants simulated the ball trajectory when solving the task, and that the outcome of these simulations may be represented in form of the perceivable sensory consequences in early visual areas.

Improvements of transgene delivery protocols and regulated gene expression systems have been proposed, but a dearth of information on compositional and/or structural features of genes has prevented transgene sequence optimization efforts for high expression levels. Here, the codon compositional features of genes in six red yeast species were characterized, and the impact that evolutionary forces may have played in shaping this compositional bias was dissected by using several computational approaches. Results obtained are compatible with the hypothesis that mutational bias, although playing a significant role, cannot alone explain synonymous codon usage bias of genes. Nevertheless, several lines of evidences indicated a role for translational selection in driving the synonymous codons that allow high expression efficiency. These optimal synonymous codons are identified for each of the six species analyzed. Moreover, the presence of intragenic patterns of codon usage, which are thought to facilitate polyribosome formation, was highlighted. The information presented should be taken into consideration for transgene design for optimal expression in red yeast species.

Public perception of genetically-modified (GM) food: A Nationwide Chinese Consumer Study	NPJ SCIENCE OF FOOD			English	Article								After more than 25 years of research and development on the genetic modification of a wide range of crops for food and fodder, China has reached a decision point as to whether it should accept, reject, or go slow with the use of genetically modified (GM) technology to produce the food and feed needed to sustain its population growth and economic renaissance. Here, we report a consumer survey on GM food that includes input from all provinces in China. Chinese consumers were surveyed for their awareness, knowledge, and opinion on GM food. The survey resulted in 11.9, 41.4, and 46.7% of respondents having a positive, neutral, or negative view on GM food, respectively. A minority of respondents (11.7%) claimed they understood the basic principles of GM technology, while most were either "neutral" or "unfamiliar with GM technology". Most respondents (69.3%) obtained their information on GM food through the Internet and 64.3% of respondents thought that media coverage was predominately negative on GM food. The reasons given by consumers in favor of, or against, the use of GM food, were complex, as seen by the response of 13.8% of respondents who felt GM technology was a form of bioterrorism targeted at China. China's Ministry of Agriculture and the science community generally expressed a positive attitude toward GM food, but the percentage of respondents that trusted the government and scientists was only 11.7 and 23.2%, respectively. Post-survey comments of respondents made suggestions on how the industrialization of GM technology might impact the future of China's food supply and value chains. Finally, the impact of emerging technologies like genome editing and genome-edited organisms (GEOs) on the GM food debate is discussed. Food safety: Inadequate knowledge underlies public scepticism about GM food Chinese consumers generally have limited understanding about genetically modified (GM) technology and this may explain their negative views about GM food. In a nationwide survey that covers all provinces of China, Kai Cui from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China studied public awareness, knowledge and opinions on GM food with colleagues. They found that most respondents hardly understand the basic principles of GM technology and are concerned about the safety of GM food. While respondents, in general, have a relatively low level of trust about information from the government or even scientists, the internet becomes the major source of information about GM food and technology, and the media coverage is perceived as predominantly negative. The results highlight the importance of strengthening communication and respecting public opinions for future development of GM technology in China.

A theoretical account of cue averaging in the rodent head direction system	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						path integration; head direction cells; isomapping; sensory cue integration; attractor dynamics; neural networks	HIPPOCAMPAL PLACE CELLS; FREELY MOVING RATS; PATH-INTEGRATION; LANDMARK STABILITY; POSTSUBICULUM; THALAMUS; NEURONS; SIGNAL; DYNAMICS; NUCLEUS	Head direction (HD) cell responses are thought to be derived from a combination of internal (or idiothetic) and external (or allothetic) sources of information. Recent work from the Jeffery laboratory shows that the relative influence of visual versus vestibular inputs upon the HD cell response depends on the disparity between these sources. In this paper, we present simulation results from a model designed to explain these observations. The model accurately replicates the Knight et al. data. We suggest that cue conflict resolution is critically dependent on plastic remapping of visual information onto the HD cell layer. This remap results in a shift in preferred directions of a subset of HD cells, which is then inherited by the rest of the cells during path integration. Thus, we demonstrate how, over a period of several minutes, a visual landmark may gain cue control. Furthermore, simulation results show that weaker visual landmarks fail to gain cue control as readily. We therefore suggest a second longer term plasticity in visual projections onto HD cell areas, through which landmarks with an inconsistent relationship to idiothetic information are made less salient, significantly hindering their ability to gain cue control. Our results provide a mechanism for reliability-weighted cue averaging that may pertain to other neural systems in addition to the HD system.	[Page, Hector J.

Somewhere downstream of strictosidine formation, however, the biosynthesis diverges to give rise to the different TIAs found, SGD may play a role in creating this biosynthetic diversity. We have studied SGD at both the molecular and enzymatic levels. Based on the homology between different plant beta-glucosidases, degenerate polymerase chain reaction primers were designed and used to isolate a cDNA clone from a Catharanthus roseus cDNA library. A full-length clone gave rise to SGD activity when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SGD shows similar to 60% homology at the amino acid level to other beta-glucosidases from plants and is encoded by a single-copy gene. Sgd expression is induced by methyl jasmonate with kinetics similar to those of two other genes acting prior to Sgd in TLA biosynthesis. These results show that coordinate induction of the biosynthetic genes forms at least part of the mechanism for the methyl jasmonate-induced increase in TIA production. Using a novel in vivo staining method, subcellular localization studies of SGD were performed, This showed that SGD is most likely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, which is in accordance with the presence of a putative signal sequence, but in contrast to previous localization studies. This new insight in SGD localization has significant implications for our understanding of the complex intracellular trafficking of metabolic intermediates during TIA biosynthesis.

Operators are still required to "supervise the (system) supervisor" and intervene when variables exceed pre-programmed parameters to avert major incidents. Research in human-computer interaction and advanced process control has often focused on data-driven methods for fault detection as distinct from operator effectiveness. In this paper, we explore the application of a novel data-driven fault-detection technique to enhance operator decision support. During a simulated abnormal event, three users attempted to diagnose the root cause of a process upset using a traditional or standard interface, then with the addition of causal maps, in a A-B-A single-subject design. The causal maps were derived using a hierarchical method that could be applied to a wide range of chemical processes as an online, adaptive augmentation for abnormal situation management. Using a think-aloud technique, the three participants developed high quality insights into the process without negatively impacting the overall task load. These preliminary findings challenge prevailing wisdom in process control interface design, which often focuses on de-cluttering displays at the cost of information resolution.

It considers the operating conditions thought to affect its performance in activated sludge plants designed to remove phosphorus microbiologically, including the still controversial view that it competes with the polyphosphate accumulating bacterium Ca. Accumulibacter for readily biodegradable substrates in the anaerobic zone receiving the influent raw sewage. It looks at its present phylogeny and what is known about it's physiology and biochemistry under the highly selective conditions of these plants, where the biomass is recycled continuously through alternative anaerobic (feed); aerobic (famine) conditions encountered there. The impact of whole genome sequence data, which have revealed considerable intra-and interclade genotypic diversity, on our understanding of its in situ behaviour is also addressed. Particular attention is paid to the problems in much of the literature data based on clone library and next generation DNA sequencing data, where Defluviicoccus identification is restricted to genus level only. Equally problematic, in many publications no attempt has been made to distinguish between Defluviicoccus and the other known GAO, especially Ca. Competibacter, which, as shown here, has a very different ecophysiology. The impact this has had and continues to have on our understanding of members of this genus is discussed, as is the present controversy over its taxonomy. It also suggests where research should be directed to answer some of the important research questions raised in this review.

An augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional considering the cross information of the singular matrix and state delay derivative is constructed. With the help of the zero-value equation technique and an improved matrix inequality, a novel delay-dependent admissible criterion is developed to make sure of the regularity, non-impulsiveness, and stability of the NTDSs. On this basis, the robust stability of the uncertain NTDSs is further explored, and a novel robust stability criterion is developed. These criteria have less conservatism. Through three number-based examples, some comparisons are provided to show the superiority and effectiveness of our method. The derived results are less conservative than the existing ones. An improved matrix inequality is proposed and some sufficient conditions are obtained. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.image	[Chen, Wenbin; Gao, Fang] Anhui Normal Univ, Sch Phys & Elect Informat, Wuhu 241000, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wenbin; Wang, Songhua; Gao, Fang] Anhui Conch Grp Co Ltd, Wuhu 246713, Peoples R China; [Zhuang, Guangming] Liaocheng Univ, Sch Math Sci, Liaocheng, Peoples R China; [Liu, Wei] Huaiyin Inst Technol, Fac Automat, Huaian, Peoples R China	Anhui Normal University; Liaocheng University; Huaiyin Institute of Technology	Chen, WB (corresponding author), Anhui Normal Univ, Sch Phys & Elect Informat, Wuhu 241000, Peoples R China.	cwb210168@126.com			This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants (62103006, 62173159, and 61803002), and the Anhui Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant (2022B597).

Notes on the use of models in systems research	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Cybernetics; Social systems; Second-order cybernetics; Modelling; Complexity; Epistemology		Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to present three different contributions to a general model theory which the authors think as relevant to systems research based on systems theory, cybernetics and constructivism. This also implies that the three contributions are shown to be of use both in the study of systems that operate by models, as well as in the practice of designing models. Design/methodology/approach - The text is conceptual and mainly of a descriptive and referring character. Besides the sections on the three contributions to a model theory, the authors have inserted sections that relate them to systems theory. This is also achieved by the help of some simple models. Findings - The paper also points to models as important instruments in constructing and selecting information to observing systems, and the authors hope that the text can be helpful in developing better knowledge of how models work.

These strategies hold promise, particularly for support of pregnancy and childbirth in low-income countries (LIC), but their design and implementation must incorporate CHW clients' perspectives to be effective and sustainable. Few studies examine how mHealth influences client and supervisor perceptions of CHW performance and quality of care in LIC. This study was embedded within a larger cluster-randomized, community intervention trial in Singida, Tanzania. CHW in intervention areas were trained to use a smartphone application designed to improve data management, patient tracking and delivery of health messages during prenatal counselling visits with women clients. Qualitative data collected through focus groups and in-depth interviews illustrated mostly positive perceptions of smartphone-assisted counselling among clients and supervisors including: increased quality of care; and improved communication, efficiency and data management. Clients also associated smartphone-assisted counselling with overall health system improvements even though the functions of the smartphones were not well understood. Smartphones were thought to signify modern, up-to-date biomedical information deemed highly desirable during pregnancy and childbirth in this context. In this rural Tanzanian setting, mHealth tools positively influenced community perceptions of health system services and client expectations of health workers; policymakers and implementers must ensure these expectations are met. Such interventions must be deeply embedded into health systems to have long-term impacts on maternal and newborn health outcomes.

Predisposing and protective factors influencing suicide ideation, attempt, and death in patients accessing substance use treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						Substance use; Treatment; Suicidality; Risk factor; Protective factor	HEROIN USERS; DRUG-USE; ALCOHOL	Background: The lifetime risk of suicide in patients with substance use disorder is five to ten times the risk in the general population. Critically, up to 19% of patients continue to think about and attempt suicide even after accessing treatment. Therefore, suicidality represents a significant clinical concern in patients struggling with substance use that warrants careful investigation of the factors involved. While most previous research has relied on limited cross-sectional designs, a growing number of prospective studies are improving our understanding of the factors involved. However, a systematic study of these factors has not yet been conducted. Methods: The primary objective of this review and possible meta-analysis will be to identify key risk and protective factors for suicide ideation, attempt, and death in patients accessing substance use treatment, guided by current models of suicide. Secondary and tertiary objectives will be to obtain pooled effect sizes for the factors identified and to disaggregate factors for suicidality before and after treatment, and for suicidal thought versus action. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we will conduct an electronic search of the literature using the databases Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Two authors will independently screen studies based on pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, extract relevant data, and assess study quality. Observational and randomized-controlled studies will be included, whereas case-studies and reviews will be excluded. We will extract data on risk and protective factors associated with suicide ideation, attempt (odds or risk ratios), and death (hazard ratio). Given sufficient data (>5 studies), we will calculate pooled effects using comprehensive meta-analysis. Discussion: This systematic review will contribute to our knowledge of risk and protective factors for suicidality in patients before and after treatment. Understanding these factors will help define areas of research for further investigation to ultimately inform risk assessment and prevention strategies.

Evidence against a subcortical gate preventing conscious detection of respiratory load stimuli	RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGY & NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Respiratory related evoked potential (RREP); Respiratory sensation; Respiratory stimulus gating; Load detection; Airway resistance; Negative airway pressure	INSPIRATORY RESISTIVE LOADS; EVOKED-POTENTIAL MEASURES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PHRENIC-NERVE AFFERENTS; MAGNITUDE ESTIMATION; PERCEPTION; THRESHOLD; COMPONENTS; RESISTANCE; OCCLUSION	Respiratory related evoked potentials (RREP) were used to examine respiratory stimulus gating. RREPs produced by consciously detected vs. undetected loads, near the detection threshold, were compared. Participants (n = 17) were instrumented with EEG and a nasal mask connected to a loading manifold, which presented a range of mid inspiratory resistive loads, plus a control, in a random block design. Participants were cued prior to the stimulus and signalled detection by a button press. There were statistically significant differences in peak-to-peak amplitude of the P1 RREP peak for detected (mean +/- SD; 3.86 +/- 1.45 mu V; P = 0.020) and undetected loads (3.67 +/- 1.27 mu V; P = 0.002) vs. control (2.36 0.81 Of), although baseline-to-peak differences were not significantly different. In contrast peak-to-peak P3 amplitude was significantly greater for detected (5.91 +/- 1.54 mu V; P < 0.001) but not undetected loads (3.33 +/- 0.98 mu V; P = 0.189) vs. control (3.69 +/- 1.46 mu V), with the same pattern observed for baseline-to-peak measurements. The P1 peak, thought to reflect arrival of somatosensory information, appeared to be present in response to both detected and undetected loads, but the later P3 peak, was present for detected loads only. This suggests that for sub-threshold loads sensory information may reach the cortex, arguing against a sub-cortical gating process.

These variations of size/shape could be thought of as deviations of a set of generalized coordinates defined at some convenient point on a feature. Any tolerance specification for a feature imposes some kind of restrictions or constraints on its deviation parameters. These constraints, in general, define a bounded region in the deviation space. In this paper, a method has been presented for converting tolerance specifications as per maximum material condition (MMC)/least material condition (LMC)/regardless of feature size (RFS) material conditions for standard mating features (planar, cylindrical, and spherical) into a set of inequalities in a deviation space. Both virtual condition boundaries' (VCB) and tolerance zones are utilized for these mappings. The mapping procedures have been illustrated with an example.

When does emerging technology lead to transformative change? A path-centric perspective on technology focuses on the patterns of actions afforded by technology in use. We identify performing and patterning as self-reinforcing mechanisms that shape patterns of action in the domain of emerging technology and organizing. We use a dynamic simulation to show that performing and patterning can lead to a wide range of trajectories, from lock-in to transformation, depending on how emerging technology in use influences the pattern of action. When emerging technologies afford new actions that can be flexibly recombined to generate new paths, decisive transformative effects are more likely. By themselves, new affordances are not likely to generate transformation. We illustrate this theory with examples from the practice of pharmaceutical drug discovery. The path-centric perspective offers a new way to think about generativity and the role of affordances in organizing.

Herein, based on the spectrum analysis and the coherent channelization, we develop a photonics-assisted channelized receiver for multi-band microwave signals. In the proposed channelized receiver, the instantaneous spectral analysis is introduced to determine the frequencies and bandwidth of a dynamic wideband signal. The dynamic wideband signal is then received by a multi-band coherent channelizer. By exploiting transparency of the optoelectronic devices, we equivalently build a multi-band coherent channelizer that can work for dynamic microwave signals, where a few optoelectronic devices are required. Compared with the existing coherent channelizers, the operative bandwidth of the proposed multi-band coherent channelizer is much larger (up to 28 GHz). The proposed photonics-assisted channelized receiver doesn't need tunable optical comb generators and radio frequency sources, and it also doesn't require knowing the spectrum information in advance. Moreover, the designed example of the proposed photonics-assisted channelized receiver for a 4 GHz original signal in 2-30 GHz microwave bands is given and discussed. The spectrum information of the dynamic original signals is obtained by monitoring the optical power in each sub-channel. We verify the feasibility of the multi-band coherent channelizer by channelizing two 4 GHz linearly-chirped signals with center frequencies of 4 and 28 GHz into four 1 GHz sub-channels, respectively.

However, in Saudi Arabia, there are no studies on the use of social media by radiographers. Therefore, the objective of this research was to evaluate the use of social media for the improvement of radiation safety knowledge among Saudi Arabian radiographers. Methods A questionnaire was designed to collect the data from Saudi Arabian radiographers. The questionnaire was created using Google Forms and was sent to 530 radiographers using WhatsApp. In total, 159 participants completed and returned the questionnaire through WhatsApp. The response rate was 30%. Basic descriptive statistics were employed to analyse the data. Results Most of the participants (79.9%) thought that social media could be used as a tool for the improvement of radiation safety knowledge. Also, almost half of participants (49.7%) employed social media when they needed to obtain information about radiation protection. Similarly, a majority of respondents (69.2%) used social media when they required information related to radiation safety. In addition, 81.7% of participants observed on video the existing information on radiation safety. Also, 71.7% of them were disposed to expand the use of social media to obtain information for radiation protection in their professional activities. Conclusion The results indicate that social media can help to improve radiation safety knowledge among Saudi Arabian radiographers. Consequently, participants were willing to increase the use of these tools in their professional work.

Several developed and developing countries have taken important measures to reduce its adverse effects, including greening their Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) curricula. However, Sub Saharan African countries are left behind to that effect, despite the fact that people in these countries are the greatest recipients of the global warming harmful consequences. The goal of this research therefore, is to investigate the suitable competencies in technical sustainability for incorporation into Higher National Diploma electrical/electronic engineering curriculum in Nigeria. The authors used mixed-method approach employing sequential exploratory design in the study. In the qualitative phase, we analyzed documents consisting of 10 journal articles and 3 skills standards, as well as conducted a total of 10 interviews with experts. Also, we carried out 3 rounds of modified Delphi survey using 28 participants to ascertain the appropriateness of the competencies suitable for infusion into the said curriculum. The study discovered competencies suitable for incorporation into the curriculum which include cognitive-related competencies in clean energy, eco-design, and R & D; psychomotor-related competencies in sustainable production, waste-to-energy-technology, communication/ICT, and use of modern engineering software tools; and affective values related to engineering ethical responsibility, occupational health and safety, cooperation/teamwork, and equity. We analyzed only 13 documents, conducted 10 interviews, and administered questionnaires in 3 rounds of Delphi survey technique to 28 experts in only one geo-political zone of the country. Thus, conclusions derived from these sources rely on the genuineness of the information provided by the participants. The findings provided the researchers, accreditation bodies as well as curriculum developers with competencies in technical sustainability in the events of curriculum upgrade or renewal to integrate technical sustainability. The findings are the results of triangulated data elicited theoretically and empirically.	[Mukhtar, Nasiru; Bin Kamin, Yusri; Saud, Muhammad Sukri B.

Integrated environmental-economic circular economy assessment: Application to the case of expanded polystyrene	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Circular economy; Life-cycle thinking; Value chain; Environmental assessment; Economic assessment	SUSTAINABILITY; PERFORMANCE; SUPPORT	Circular Economy (CE), despite its great potential, is often challenged for not being sustainable from an environmental, economic and social perspective, or at least not in all dimensions simultaneously. Therefore, assessments that integrate different sustainability dimensions are necessary to facilitate CE implementation, particularly before entire value chains are reconfigured or incentivized to do so. However, integrated CE assessment methods remain scarce, especially at a value-chain level. We aim to bridge this gap by suggesting an approach that evaluates and integrates the environmental and economic impacts of implementing CE at the value-chain level. The approach is based on material flow analysis, life-cycle assessment, life-cycle costing, and scenario development. The application of the approach to the expanded polystyrene (EPS) value chain revealed that EPS recycling can be environmentally and economically beneficial in the long term. The approach was developed to support political and industrial decision-makers seeking to implement a sustainable CE.

A Comprehensive Network Atlas Reveals That Turing Patterns Are Common but Not Robust	CELL SYSTEMS			English	Article							POSITIONAL INFORMATION; BIFURCATION-ANALYSIS; DIFFUSION; DIFFERENTIATION; TOPOLOGIES; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM; SWITCH; CELLS; MODEL	Turing patterns (TPs) underlie many fundamental developmental processes, but they operate over narrow parameter ranges, raising the conundrum of how evolution can ever discover them. Here we explore TP design space to address this question and to distill design rules. We exhaustively analyze 2- and 3-node biological candidate Turing systems, amounting to 7,625 networks and more than 3 x 10(11) analyzed scenarios. We find that network structure alone neither implies nor guarantees emergent TPs. A large fraction (>61%) of network design space can produce TPs, but these are sensitive to even subtle changes in parameters, network structure, and regulatory mechanisms. This implies that TP networks are more common than previously thought, and evolution might regularly encounter prototypic solutions. We deduce compositional rules for TP systems that are almost necessary and sufficient (96% of TP networks contain them, and 92% of networks implementing them produce TPs). This comprehensive network atlas provides the blueprints for identifying natural TPs and for engineering synthetic systems.	[Scholes, Natalie S.; Schnoerr, David; Isalan, Mark; Stumpf, Michael P.

Objective-To obtain (1) insight into recipients' perceptions of weight gain and (2) information on intervention strategies that recipients think could prevent weight gain. Design-Qualitative focus groups and a 13-question, multiple-choice survey were used. Setting-A regional mid-South transplant center. Participants-Seven kidney transplant recipients (86% African American, 57% female, mean age 55.0 years) who had gained at least 12% of their total body weight during a 12-month larger observational study. Main Outcome Measures-Content from the focus group sessions was analyzed for major and minor themes. The survey results were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Results-Identified themes included barriers to healthy eating caused by medications and removal of dietary restrictions. Barriers to physical activity included fear of injuring the new organ and health problems both related and unrelated to transplant. Perceived effects of weight gain included hypertension, diabetes, and embarrassment and concern at the rapid weight gain. Recipients would like an early start to implementation of lifestyle changes. Useful ideas included written materials regarding appropriate physical activities and dietary information, healthy cooking classes, and support groups.

However, such neural encoding can also often be explained by the recall of information about the recent past. To dissociate the retrospective and prospective aspects of encoding in the OFC, we designed a nonspatial, continuous, alternating odor-sequence task that mimicked a continuous T-maze. The task consisted of two alternating sequences of four odor-guided trials (2 sequences x 4 positions). In each trial, rats were asked to make a "go" or "no-go" action based on a fixed odor-reward contingency. Odors at both the first and last positions were distinct across the two sequences, such that they resembled unique paths in the past and future, respectively; odors at positions in between were the same and thus resembled a common path. We trained classifiers using neural activity to distinguish between either sequences or positions and asked whether the neural activity patterns in the common path were more like the ones in the past or the future. We found a proximal prospective code for sequence information as well as a distal perspective code for positional information, the latter of which was closely associated with rats' ability to predict future outcomes. This study demonstrates a behaviorally relevant predictive code in rat OFC.	[Zhou, Jingfeng; Zong, Wenhui; Gardner, Matthew P.

Dual-site Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (ds-TACS) has been recently introduced as non-invasive technique to manipulate the temporal phase relationship of local oscillations in two connected cortical areas. While the frequency of ds-TACS is matched, the phase of stimulation is either identical (in-phase stimulation) or opposite (anti-phase stimulation) in the two cortical target areas. In-phase stimulation is thought to synchronize the endogenous oscillations and hereby to improve behavioral performance. Conversely, anti-phase stimulation is thought to desynchronize neural oscillations in the two areas, which is expected to decrease performance. Critically, in-and anti-phase ds-TACS should only differ with respect to temporal phase, while all other stimulation parameters such as focality and stimulation intensity should be matched to enable an unambiguous interpretation of the behavioral effects. Using electric field simulations based on a realistic head geometry, we tested how well this goal has been met in studies, which have employed ds-TACS up to now. Separating the induced electrical fields in their spatial and temporal components, we investigated how the chosen electrode montages determined the spatial field distribution and the generation of phase variations in the injected electric fields. Considering the basic physical mechanisms, we derived recommendations for an optimized stimulation montage. The latter allows for a principled design of in-and anti-phase ds-TACS conditions with matched spatial distributions of the electric field. This knowledge will help cognitive neuroscientists to design optimal ds-TACS configurations, which are suited to probe unambiguously the causal contribution of phase coupling to specific cognitive processes in the human brain.

J	Xiao, ZG; Wang, JH; Deng, HS				Xiao, Zhigao; Wang, Jinghan; Deng, HanSong			A 3D Multimedia Ecological Landscape Environment and Teaching Mode Based on Digital Interactive Experience	MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								With the development of society, the design concept of urban landscape needs to be constantly updated. The lack of functional innovation, service experience, and intelligent management cannot bring urban residents a sense of experience. In modern urban landscape design, the urban public landscape is combined with digital media art, to constantly renew urban image and optimize urban function. However, several methods have been created for the real-time presentation of very vast terrains. Though several of these solutions combined high-quality representation with amazing efficiency, the majority of them are based on the basic concept that the terrain is defined by a constant height map that cannot be changed at run time. These systems usually make considerable use of raw terrain data preprocessing. They are generally intended for peak efficiency. Keeping the above in mind, this paper analyzes the 3D multimedia ecological landscape environment and teaching mode based on digital virtual technology. The purpose of this paper is to apply digital media art as an innovative technical tool and aesthetic thinking in the new era of urban landscape design and to innovate the concept and means of urban landscape design. As a new landscape design method, the application of digital media could make a visual display of the urban landscape. The intervention of virtual reality technology also enhances the interaction and perception of the urban landscape.

Experimental Evidence	POLITICAL BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Repositioning; Public opinion; Flip-flop; Elections; Candidate positioning; Representation	INFORMATION; CANDIDATES	Although changing policy positions is often thought of as costly for politicians, this may not always be the case. We present findings from two survey experiments designed to assess how people respond to politicians who change positions on an issue. We examine the direct effects of position changes on both summary evaluations of a candidate and ratings of a candidate's character. We find that the effect of changing positions varies across issues and that the passage of time attenuates the negative effects of a change of position. We also find that although individual voters prefer a candidate who moves closer to their own preferred policy position to one who sticks to a disliked policy position, in the aggregate changing policy positions may be costly unless the prospective new position is supported by a supermajority of the public.

J	Cho, HJ				Cho, Hyunjung			Arata Isozaki: the architect as artist	ARQ-ARCHITECTURAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY			English	Article								This paper is not a comprehensive survey of the architectural career of Arata Isozaki, one of the most distinguished practicing architects in the world today and the 2019 winner of the Pritzker Prize, but a specific look at his formative years of the 1960s when he began to build his own design methodology. It delineates Isozaki's encounter with the avant-garde art movement of the 1960s, collectively called "Anti-Art, " against the backdrop of the "anti-spirit" of Japanese society. Although Isozaki's artistic side has been overstated at times, previous studies rarely addressed how his intensive interactions with art circles played a role in shaping his design methodology. I would like to examine the convergence of creative individuals and cross-disciplinary connections to understand Isozaki's architectural thinking. This study examines how Isozaki's collaborations with his artist contemporaries enabled him to formulate the notion of the "invisible city, " a radically new design concept characterised by the expansion of the nature of architecture from producing isolated built-forms to all-encompassing natural and manmade environments. However, after drawing on communications and information theory, which prevailed in 60s architectural circles, Isozaki's destructive and anarchistic connotation of "invisible city" was channeled into a systematic cybernetic model and eventually transformed into a constructive planning method. I will discuss the realisation of a cybernetic environment at the Festival Plaza of Expo' 70 and trace the legacy of "invisible city" in his later postmodern work.

J	Durak, HY				Durak, Hatice Yildiz			Flipped classroom model applications in computing courses: Peer-assisted groups, collaborative group and individual learning	COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						academic self-efficacy; academic success; collaborative group; computer anxiety; e-learning readiness; Flipped classroom; individual learning; peer assisted group; university students	SELF-EFFICACY; HIGHER-EDUCATION; 12 TIPS; PERFORMANCE; MOTIVATION; EXPERIENCE; READINESS; ENHANCE; DESIGN; INTERACTIVITY	The Flipped Classroom (FC) provides various opportunities to ensure active learning in a student-based learning environment. In the literature, it is pointed out that the FC model provided a positive contribution to the teaching process when it was used for learning environments in past studies. Besides this, it is seen that FC was integrated into a learning method and the results were generally associated with only FC. From this point of view, it is thought that the methodological effect of FC needs to be examined. The aim of this study is to identify whether the use of different models (peer-assisted group: PAL-FC, collaborative group: SGCL-FC, and individual learning: IL-FC) in FC for computing courses of university students has an effect on academic performances, learning motivation, academic self-efficacy, computer anxiety of the university students, and flipped learning readiness. This study is designed with a mixed method. The working group of the study is composed of 242 university students. The application lasted for 14 weeks. In this study, data have been collected by a Personal Information Form, semi-structured interview form, information technologies achievement test, and four different data collection tools. As a result of the research, it is found out that different applications in the FC model have a significant effect on academic success, academic self-efficacy, e-learning readiness in FC. FC model application with PAL-FC has proved more successful when compared to other methods in terms of developing performance and reducing technology anxiety. Also, it is seen that motivation and academic self-efficacy in FC has improved positively for collaborative group work.

Big data, data privacy, and plant and animal disease research using GEMS	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							SYSTEM	One of the major challenges in ensuring global food security is the ever-changing biotic risk affecting the productivity and efficiency of the global food supply system. Biotic risks that threaten food security include pests and diseases that affect pre- and postharvest terrestrial agriculture and aquaculture. Strategies to minimize this risk depend heavily on plant and animal disease research. As data collected at high spatial and temporal resolutions become increasingly available, epidemiological models used to assess and predict biotic risks have become more accurate and, thus, more useful. However, with the advent of Big Data opportunities, a number of challenges have arisen that limit researchers' access to complex, multi-sourced, multi-scaled data collected on pathogens, and their associated environments and hosts. Among these challenges, one of the most limiting factors is data privacy concerns from data owners and collectors. While solutions, such as the use of de-identifying and anonymizing tools that protect sensitive information are recognized as effective practices for use by plant and animal disease researchers, there are comparatively few platforms that include data privacy by design that are accessible to researchers. We describe how the general thinking and design used for data sharing and analysis platforms can intrinsically address a number of these data privacy-related challenges that are a barrier to researchers wanting to access data. We also describe how some of the data privacy concerns confronting plant and animal disease researchers are addressed by way of the GEMS informatics platform.	[Senay, Senait D.; Silverstein, Kevin A.

Role of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Gene Polymorphisms and Hypertension-induced End-stage Renal Disease in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF KIDNEY DISEASES			English	Review						renin-angiotensin system; genetic polymorphism; autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; hypertension; end-stage renal disease	OXIDE SYNTHASE GENE; I-CONVERTING-ENZYME; TYPE-1 RECEPTOR GENE; BLOOD-PRESSURE RESPONSE; NITRIC-OXIDE; ACE GENE; GLU298ASP POLYMORPHISM; CANDIDATE GENES; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; DELETION POLYMORPHISM	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited disease of the kidneys and is marked by progressive cyst growth and decline in kidney function, resulting in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hypertension is thought to be a significant modifying factor in the progression of renal failure in ADPKD. A number of genetic variations involved in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) pathway genes have clinical or physiological impacts on pathogenesis of hypertension-induced ESRD in ADPKD. Information on RAAS pathway gene polymorphisms and their association with ESRD and ADPKD, published till March 2013, was collected using MEDLINE search. The present review deals with RAAS gene polymorphisms focused on hypertension-induced ESRD in ADPKD in different populations. The results were inconclusive and limited by heterogeneity in the study designs and the population stratification. In lieu of applying next generation sequencing technologies to study complex diseases, it is also possible to apply the same to unravel the complexity of ESRD in ADPKD.

A Review of Technologies for Assessing Changes in Habitats Caused by Marine Energy Development	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Review						biofouling; epifauna; habitat; infauna; marine energy; pelagic; sampling; seafloor; sediment; technologies	TIDAL ENERGY; OFFSHORE OIL; FISH; ABUNDANCE; IMPACTS; REEFS; COMMUNITIES; ASSEMBLAGES; EPIFAUNA; BEHAVIOR	Marine energy devices are installed in highly dynamic environments and have the potential to affect the benthic and pelagic habitats around them. Regulatory bodies often require baseline characterization and/or post-installation monitoring to determine whether changes in these habitats are being observed. However, a great diversity of technologies is available for surveying and sampling marine habitats, and selecting the most suitable instrument to identify and measure changes in habitats at marine energy sites can become a daunting task. We conducted a thorough review of journal articles, survey reports, and grey literature to extract information about the technologies used, the data collection and processing methods, and the performance and effectiveness of these instruments. We examined documents related to marine energy development, offshore wind farms, oil and gas offshore sites, and other marine industries around the world over the last 20 years. A total of 120 different technologies were identified across six main habitat categories: seafloor, sediment, infauna, epifauna, pelagic, and biofouling. The technologies were organized into 12 broad technology classes: acoustic, corer, dredge, grab, hook and line, net and trawl, plate, remote sensing, scrape samples, trap, visual, and others. Visual was the most common and the most diverse technology class, with applications across all six habitat categories. Technologies and sampling methods that are designed for working efficiently in energetic environments have greater success at marine energy sites. In addition, sampling designs and statistical analyses should be carefully thought through to identify differences in faunal assemblages and spatiotemporal changes in habitats.

Design and Measures: A qualitative approach using peer moderated focus groups was used to elicit reflections on the Facebook site's content, appeal, and ease of navigation. Focus group discussions were transcribed, coded, and analyzed for themes using conventional content analysis. Demographic data were analyzed with SPSS. Sample: Participants (n = 63) were recruited from a Midwestern university and both an urban and rural high school. Eight focus groups were conducted. Results: Participants reported significant concerns with the stigma associated with having sexual health conversations with parents, peers or providers. Participants thought the Facebook site provided reliable sexual health information, was not condescending, and was more visually appealing than other sites frequented by technology-proficient AEA. AEAs suggested developing an independent sexual health education website. Conclusion: Findings demonstrate the importance for having accurate and reliable sexual health information available on the internet. The use of visually appealing social media to communicate sexual health content that is interactive, informative, and user-friendly and meets the educational needs of AEA in the Midwest is recommended.

The implementation of clinical guidelines is a core strategy of AMS programs. Nevertheless, their dissemination and application remain low. Computerised decision support systems (CDSSs) offer new opportunities for semi-automated dissemination of guidelines. This qualitative study aimed at gaining an in-depth understanding of the determinants of adherence to antimicrobial prescribing guidelines and CDSSs adoption and is part of a larger project, the COMPASS trial, which aims to assess a CDSS for antimicrobial prescription. The final objective of this qualitative study is to 1) provide insights from end-users to assist in the design of the COMPASS CDSS, and to 2) help with the interpretation of the quantitative findings of the randomised controlled trial assessing the COMPASS CDSS, once data will be analysed. Methods: We conducted semi-structured individual interviews among in-hospital physicians in two hospitals in Switzerland and one hospital in France. Physicians were recruited by convenience sampling and snowballing until data saturation was achieved. Results: Twenty-nine physicians were interviewed. We identified three themes related to the potential barriers to guideline adherence: 1) insufficient clarity, accessibility and applicability of guidelines, 2) need of critical thinking skills to adhere to guidelines and 3) impact of the team prescribing process and peers on physicians in training. As to the perception of CDSSs, we identified four themes that could affect their adoption: 1) CDSSs are perceived as time-consuming, 2) CDSSs could reduce physicians' critical thinking and professional autonomy and raise new medico-legal issues, 3) effective CDSSs would require specific features, such as ease of use and speed, which affect usability and 4) CDSSs could improve physicians' adherence to guidelines and patient care. Discussion: CDSSs have the potential to overcome several barriers for adherence to guidelines by improving accessibility and providing individualised recommendations backed by patient data. When designing CDSSs, mixed clinical and information technology teams should focus on user-friendliness, ergonomics, workflow integration and transparency of the decision-making process.

J	Siam, J; Abdo, A				Siam, Jamal; Abdo, Ali			Effects of inquiry, computer simulation, and cooperation with intergroup competition on electrical engineering students	RESEARCH IN SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Intergroup-competition; electric filters; jigsaw; autonomous learning; simulation	CONSTRUCTIVE COMPETITION; ENGAGEMENT; SCIENCE; ACHIEVEMENT; GOALS; PERFORMANCE; MOTIVATION; MODELS	Background: Undergraduate electrical-engineering courses are traditionally taught using the lecturing approach. As for all the teacher-centered approaches, the students perceive learning as an individualistic task and consider lecture-notes their principal information source. They tend to employ the minimum possible efforts to get acceptable marks and compete against other students for best scores. Learning theories considers learner-centered approaches, such as, inquiry, computer simulation, self-directed learning, cooperation and competition, valuable alternatives to the traditional lecturing approach. Purpose: This study aims to develop, apply, and assess a new teaching approach to teach electric filters. The new-approach aims to improve the electrical engineering students learning outcomes and achievement, learning autonomy, and students perception of the role of engagement and cooperation in learning. Sample: Sixty-four students voluntarily participated in the study. Thirty-two students voluntarily decided to participate in the new learning approach study-group, whereas the others played the role of the control-group and followed the traditional-teaching method. Design and methods: The design of the new-approach combines inquiry, computer simulation, and cooperation with intergroup competition. The new-approach is developed in two phases. In the first phase, the preparation phase, the students learned electric filters using simple inquiry, cooperation, and learned and applied computer simulation in filter analysis. The second phase was a face-to-face debate on filters. Data was collected using pre-tests, post-tests, questionnaires, direct observation, and student portfolios. Independent and paired T-tests were used to verify the study hypothesis. Results: The findings showed that, the student could learn autonomously. The new method improved the students learning outcomes and achievements. It also improved the electrical engineering students' perception of the role of engagement and cooperation in learning. Conclusions: The study showed that, following the new-approach improved the tackled electrical engineering students' characteristics and defeated some of the negative effects of the traditional lecturing. This leads to think that a long-term implementation of the proposed approach can provide the students with the essential attitudes and skills that serve their future as electrical engineering professionals.

J	Brito, C; Sousa, A				Brito, Cristina; Sousa, Andreia			The Environmental History of Cetaceans in Portugal: Ten Centuries of Whale and Dolphin Records	PLOS ONE			English	Review								The history between cetaceans and humans is documented throughout time not only in reports, descriptions, and tales but also in legal documents, laws and regulations, and tithes. This wealth of information comes from the easy spotting and identification of individuals due to their large size, surface breathing, and conspicuous above water behaviour. This work is based on historical sources and accounts accounting for cetacean presence for the period between the 12th and 17th centuries, as well as scientific articles, newspapers, illustrations, maps, non-published scientific reports, and other grey literature from the 18th century onwards. Information on whale use in Portugal's mainland has been found since as early as the 12th century and has continued to be created throughout time. No certainty can be given for medieval and earlier events, but both scavenging of stranded whales or use of captured ones may have happened. There is an increasing number of accounts of sighted, stranded, used, or captured cetaceans throughout centuries which is clearly associated with a growing effort towards the study of these animals. Scientific Latin species denominations only started to be registered from the 18th century onwards, as a consequence of the evolution of natural sciences in Portugal and increasing interest from zoologists. After the 19th century, a larger number of observations were recorded, and from the 20th century to the present day, regular scientific records have been collected. Research on the environmental history of cetaceans in Portugal shows a several-centuries-old exploitation of whales and dolphins, as resources mainly for human consumption, followed in later centuries by descriptions of natural history documenting strandings and at sea encounters. Most cetaceans species currently thought to be present in Portuguese mainland waters were at some point historically recorded.

With the expansion of several Nigerian cities, existing buildings constitute a significant portion of the building stock, and improving their environmental performance could be more cost-effective than reconstruction. The use of simulation packages to assess alternative retrofitting enhancement scenarios is a straightforward approach. However, in Nigeria it is often challenging to get appropriate information to facilitate this type of evaluation; many buildings were not built to their original specifications, and when available, the records are often in a poor state due to deterioration. Studies that aimed at enhancing a building's performance hardly stated the acquisition of the required building information. This paper investigates current practices and future possibilities of improvement measures and data capturing of existing buildings using a questionnaire survey of 133 building professionals in Benin City. The inter-relationship between energy efficiency, the environment, and building design with a high potential for meaningful retrofit to mitigate energy inefficiencies is known but not fully utilized. The collected thought on current practices signifies the need for developing a more economical and reliable methodology for data capturing and evaluation.

Repetitive DNA sequences play an important role in genome structuring and evolution, so understanding the chromosomal organization and distribution of these sequences in Avena species could provide valuable information concerning genome evolution in this genus. In this study, the chromosomal organizations and distributions of six repetitive DNA sequences (including three SSR motifs (TTC, AAC, CAG), one 5S rRNA gene fragment, and two oat A and C genome specific repeats) were investigated using non-denaturing fluorescence in situ hybridization (ND-FISH) in the three tetraploid species mentioned above and in two hexaploid oat species. Preferential distribution of the SSRs in centromeric regions was seen in the A and D genomes, where as few signals were detected in the C genomes. Some intergenomic translocations were observed in the tetraploids; such translocations were also detected between the C and D genomes in the hexaploids. These results provide robust evidence for the presence of the D genome in all three tetraploids, strongly suggesting that the genomic constitution of these species is DC and not AC, as had been thought previously.

J	Vinken, K; Op de Beeck, H				Vinken, Kasper; Op de Beeck, Hans			Using deep neural networks to evaluate object vision tasks in rats	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							NATURAL MOVIES; REPRESENTATIONS; RECOGNITION; STREAMS; SHAPE	In the last two decades rodents have been on the rise as a dominant model for visual neuroscience. This is particularly true for earlier levels of information processing, but a number of studies have suggested that also higher levels of processing such as invariant object recognition occur in rodents. Here we provide a quantitative and comprehensive assessment of this claim by comparing a wide range of rodent behavioral and neural data with convolutional deep neural networks. These networks have been shown to capture hallmark properties of information processing in primates through a succession of convolutional and fully connected layers. We find that performance rodent object vision tasks can be captured using low to mid-level convolutional layers only, without any convincing evidence for the need of higher layers known to simulate complex object recognition in primates. Our approach also reveals surprising insights on assumptions made before, for example, that the best performing animals would be the ones using the most abstract representations-which we show to likely be incorrect. Our findings suggest a road ahead for further studies aiming at quantifying and establishing the richness of representations underlying information processing in animal models at large. Author summary Despite years of investigating object recognition in rodents, it remains unclear to what extent their visual system supports a capacity for high-level, abstract representations. Here, we used computational deep neural network models to assess which level of abstraction is required to reproduce rodent behavior in several studies, and which level matches representations in higher rodent visual areas. We found that both behavioral and neural data support mid-level representations at best, and show that certain evidence available in the literature may not provide as strong support for invariant visual object recognition as previously thought. Going forward, our findings suggest that computational models could serve as a principled benchmark for evaluating the richness of information processing across species and for designing experiments to push the boundaries of animal models.

The moment-preserving technique can be thought of as an information transformation method which groups the pixels of an image into classes. The variables in the so-called moment-preserving equations are determined iteratively by a recurrent neural network and a connectionist neural network which work cooperatively. Both of the networks are designed in such a way that the sum of square errors between the moments of the input image and those of the output version is minimized. The proposed neural network system is applied to automatic threshold selection. The experimental results show that the system can threshold images successfully. The performance of the proposed method is also compared with those of four other histogram-based multilevel threshold selection methods. The simulation results show that the proposed technique is at least as good as the other methods.

This dissociation is thought to result from lexical feedback influencing orthographic representations in word processing. As nonwords do not receive this feedback, bottom-up processing of prime-target integration leads to matched-case effects. However, the underlying mechanism of this effect in nonwords remains unclear. In this study, we added a color congruency manipulation across the prime and target in the matched-case identity-priming design. We aimed to determine whether the case effects originate at the early stages of prime-target perceptual integration or due to bottom-up activation of case-specific letter detectors. Results replicated the previous dissociation between words and nonwords regarding the matched-case identity effect. Additionally, we did not find any modulation of these effects by prime-target color congruency. These findings suggest that the locus of the matched-case identity effect is at an orthographic level of representation that encodes case information.

ESP is a network of secondary schools in various countries in- and outside of Europe, that perform collaborative distance learning projects. The projects, termed teletrips, involve various types of learning and inquiring activities. Teletrips are collaborative learning projects, designed by teachers from partner schools around a part of curriculum that is thought to be mutually relevant. Leading idea of a Teletrip is the combination of local research of pupils around a certain topic and exchange of research results with partner-schools, using a foreign language and electronic mail. This paper reports on some of the results of the Teletrip ''Statistics in Evervday Life'', in which schools in the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain were involved. The project took place between autumn 1990 and spring 1991. New technologies were used in two different ways. First electronic mail was used to share information and data. In the second place appropriate software, for word processing, spreadsheet and statistical analysis, the latter specially designed for education, was used to support the local education of statistics. This paper was co-operatively written by the authors, using ESP's telematic facilities.

J	Song, ZJ				Song, Zhenjie			Facial Expression Emotion Recognition Model Integrating Philosophy and Machine Learning Theory	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						facial expression; emotion recognition; philosophy; machine learning; neural networks	REPRESENTATION; INFORMATION; NETWORKS	Facial expression emotion recognition is an intuitive reflection of a person's mental state, which contains rich emotional information, and is one of the most important forms of interpersonal communication. It can be used in various fields, including psychology. As a celebrity in ancient China, Zeng Guofan's wisdom involves facial emotion recognition techniques. His book Bing Jian summarizes eight methods on how to identify people, especially how to choose the right one, which means "look at the eyes and nose for evil and righteousness, the lips for truth and falsehood; the temperament for success and fame, the spirit for wealth and fortune; the fingers and claws for ideas, the hamstrings for setback; if you want to know his consecution, you can focus on what he has said." It is said that a person's personality, mind, goodness, and badness can be showed by his face. However, due to the complexity and variability of human facial expression emotion features, traditional facial expression emotion recognition technology has the disadvantages of insufficient feature extraction and susceptibility to external environmental influences. Therefore, this article proposes a novel feature fusion dual-channel expression recognition algorithm based on machine learning theory and philosophical thinking. Specifically, the feature extracted using convolutional neural network (CNN) ignores the problem of subtle changes in facial expressions. The first path of the proposed algorithm takes the Gabor feature of the ROI area as input. In order to make full use of the detailed features of the active facial expression emotion area, first segment the active facial expression emotion area from the original face image, and use the Gabor transform to extract the emotion features of the area. Focus on the detailed description of the local area. The second path proposes an efficient channel attention network based on depth separable convolution to improve linear bottleneck structure, reduce network complexity, and prevent overfitting by designing an efficient attention module that combines the depth of the feature map with spatial information.

Research from organization and strategy perspectives, such as paradox and organizational learning, has offered useful but limited insight into the systematic mindset and thinking processes involved in decision making. We draw on theoretical and philosophical foundations of the transparadox perspective and related theories to build a dynamic process cycle of transparadoxical decision making. Three interrelated dimensions make up our model: (1) Transparadox Information Navigation, which includes embracing oppositional tendencies, syncretic focus, and creative transcendence; (2) Transparadox Contextual Consideration, characterized by prudent precision and recognizing the flux of temporality and spatiality; and (3) Transparadox Integration, which comprises design-type integration and exploration-type integration. We then present propositions on the interdependent and reinforcing mechanism among the three dimensions. Our work expands the paradox literature with specific mindset dimensions and constituent elements, connecting paradox research with the cognitive perspective by adding dynamic, cyclical processes to paradox cognition study.

Deep insight into inhibitor-BACE1 binding mechanism is of significance for design of potent drugs toward BACE1. In this work, multiple replica accelerated molecular dynamics (MR-aMD) simulations, principal component (PC) analysis, and free energy landscapes were integrated to decode the effect of disulfide bonds (SSBs) in BACE1 on bindings of three inhibitors 3KO, 3KT, and 779 to BACE1. The results from cross-correlation analysis suggest that the breaking of SSBs exerts significant influence on structural flexibility and internal dynamics of inhibitor-bound BACE1. PC analysis and free energy landscapes reveal that the breaking of SSBs not only evidently induces the conformational rearrangement of BACE1 but also highly changes binding poses of three inhibitors in BACE1 and leads to more disordered binding of three inhibitors to BACE1, which is further supported by the increase in binding entropy of inhibitors to BACE1 due to the breaking of SSBs. Residue-based free energy decomposition method was utilized to evaluate contributions of separate residues to inhibitor-BACE1 binding. The results suggest that although the breaking of SSBs in BACE1 does not destroy the interaction network of inhibitors with BACE1 it changes interaction strength of some residues with inhibitors. Meanwhile, the information from residue-based free energy decomposition indicates that residues L91, S96, V130, Y132, Q134, W137, F169, 1171, and 1179 can be used as efficient targets of drug design toward BACE1.

Genetic resources in asparagus: diversity and relationships in a collection from different origins and breeding status	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF CROP AND HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Asparagus; genetic resources; genetic diversity; Sequence Related Amplified Polymorphism markers; genetic breeding	AMPLIFIED POLYMORPHISM SRAP; MARKER SYSTEM; IDENTIFICATION; SSR; TRAITS; MAPS; RAPD	Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) is a worldwide important vegetable. Assessing the genetic diversity and relationships in a germplasm collection is a key step in the design of breeding programmes. The aim of this work was to evaluate the genetic diversity in asparagus from a wide array of origins assessed by Sequence Related Amplified Polymorphism (SRAP) markers. Twenty-four accessions of A. officinalis from 13 different origins and one accession of A. pseudoscaber were considered. Sixteen combinations of SRAP primers were tested. A total of 329 bands were obtained (98.48% polymorphism). The average polymorphic information content was 0.20. Hierarchical clustering was carried out, the dendrogram was plotted with bootstrap p-values for the different branches and the Dice's distance matrix was represented by a Principal Coordinates Analysis. It was not possible to establish a clear origin-related grouping. The reduced cycles of selection accomplished along with the contemporaneous plant breeding and the open-pollinated nature of the species, could have precluded a marked differentiation in the species related to origins or cultivated to wild status. The genetic base of asparagus is not as narrow as previously thought. The information of the genetic relationships among asparagus germplasm could be useful to delineate crosses in order to seek potential hybrid vigour.

Therefore, it is important to develop methods to investigate the role of key genes involved in cancer cell stemness. Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common and mortal types of cancers. Gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs) are thought to be the root of gastric cancer relapse, metastasis and drug resistance. Understanding GCSCs biology is needed to advance the development of targeted therapies and eventually to reduce mortality among patients. In this protocol, we present an experimental design using a conditional knockdown system and an adapted sphere formation assay to study the effect of clusterin on the stemness of patient-derived GCSCs. The protocol can be easily adapted to study both in vitro and in vivo function of stemness-associated genes in different types of CSCs.

Compared with existing works, we introduce multiple plants topology in order to smooth the information exchanges among different plants. Gained insight into the adaptive model features in the view of event-triggered thought, the event-triggered rules, determining when the control inputs update, are obtained using the Lyapunov technique to reduce the communication cost. By designing some adaptive updating laws combined with the concept of event-triggered, the unknown parameters in uncertain multi-plant networked control systems are real-time online estimated and adjusted with respect to the relevant nominal systems at event-triggered instants. To avoid Zeno phenomena, a lower bound of event-triggered execution interval is discussed. Furthermore, given the external perturbations, L2 gain stability theory is introduced to analyze the stability of multi-plant networked control systems with bounded perturbations, and then the sufficient conditions related to the multiple plants topology structure are derived. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretic results.

Abstract representations of events arise from mental errors in learning and memory	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SUCCESSOR REPRESENTATION; INFORMATION; MODELS; VARIABILITY; INFERENCE; ACCURACY; PATTERNS; LANGUAGE; THOUGHT	Humans are adept at uncovering abstract associations in the world around them, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Intuitively, learning the higher-order structure of statistical relationships should involve complex mental processes. Here we propose an alternative perspective: that higher-order associations instead arise from natural errors in learning and memory. Using the free energy principle, which bridges information theory and Bayesian inference, we derive a maximum entropy model of people's internal representations of the transitions between stimuli. Importantly, our model (i) affords a concise analytic form, (ii) qualitatively explains the effects of transition network structure on human expectations, and (iii) quantitatively predicts human reaction times in probabilistic sequential motor tasks. Together, these results suggest that mental errors influence our abstract representations of the world in significant and predictable ways, with direct implications for the study and design of optimally learnable information sources. Humans can easily uncover abstract associations. Here, the authors propose that higher-order associations arise from natural errors in learning and memory. They suggest that mental errors influence the humans' representation of the world in significant and predictable ways.

It describes implementation of a three-stage 18-week program of online group collaborative learning intervention involving 31 pre-service teacher participants from three different courses at a teacher education center. Data were collected from various sources, including individual interviews, project artifacts, and group interviews, and responses were obtained to questions related to CRT pedagogy and WebQuest. Careful analysis of the data revealed multiple roles of cloud computing and use of social media technologies for informal learning. Participants' Facebook usage also demonstrated the critical role of social presence in forming learning communities. The findings also demonstrated that the pre-service teachers were most confident when incorporating multicultural information, resources, and materials in creating WebQuests. Meanwhile, the WebQuest tasks designed by them were rarely for higher order thinking skills because of stereotyping of children of immigrants. Discussion and implications of the study are also described.

Increasing evidence suggests that interdependent risk can best be addressed by working across boundaries (jurisdictional, scalar, and expertise) by sharing information and cooperating in management activities. Polycentric governance has emerged as a framework to understand how multiple and overlapping centers of decision-making authority establish and maintain governance connectivity to solve collective action problems and interdependent risks. Previous studies have examined the collaborative and interorganizational process of polycentric landscape governance, yet most studies rely on qualitative case study data or descriptively employ social network analysis. Understanding the values, beliefs, and motivations of actors (land managers, landowners, researchers, policymakers, and non-governmental organizations) for cooperating is important for improving polycentric governance design, implementation, and operation. How the context and characteristics of social-ecological systems shape polycentric governance remains largely unexplored. On the basis of research in the Sequoia-Kings Canyon Protected Area-Centered Ecosystem, we address this gap by utilizing exponential random graph modeling to analyze the social and ecological drivers of polycentric wildfire governance. This research highlights that even in situations of high stakes (increasing occurrences of high-severity wildfires that escape suppression) actors will collaborate only if the gains from collaboration outweigh the costs. If jurisdictions or other organizations are thought to have low operational capacity or lack useful information, even with a high probability of large wildfire, the actor-to-actor connections are less likely for effective polycentric governance. Our results highlight previously undiscussed mechanisms of network formation in wildfire hazard governance, and we discuss the broader applicability for forest landscape challenges and for polycentric governance design and assessment in other social-ecological contexts.

The mark indicates the value of some attribute associated to the respective edge or vertex. Examples of such data arise in social networks, molecular and systems biology, and web graphs, as well as in several other application areas. Our goal is to design schemes that can efficiently compress such graphical data without making assumptions about its stochastic properties. Namely, we wish to develop a universal compression algorithm for graphical data sources. To formalize this goal, we employ the framework of local weak convergence, also called the objective method, which provides a technique to think of a marked graph as a kind of stationary stochastic processes, stationary with respect to movement between vertices of the graph. In recent work, we have generalized a notion of entropy for unmarked graphs in this framework, due to Bordenave and Caputo, to the case of marked graphs. We use this notion to evaluate the efficiency of a compression scheme. The lossless compression scheme we propose in this paper is then proved to be universally optimal in a precise technical sense. It is also capable of performing local data queries in the compressed form.

J	Sun, HH; Zhang, CC; Hu, CH; Zhang, JG				Sun, Huihui; Zhang, Changchun; Hu, Chunhe; Zhang, Junguo			Event-triggered reconfigurable reinforcement learning motion-planning approach for mobile robot in unknown dynamic environments	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Mobile robot; Reinforcement learning; Actor-critic; Reconfigurable structure; Sample pretreatment; Event-triggered	NAVIGATION; PERCEPTION	Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an essential technique for autonomous motion planning of mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. In attempting to acquire a satisfactory DRL-based motion planning strategy, the mobile robots encountered several difficulties, including poor convergence, insufficient sample information, and low learning efficiency. These problems not only consume plenty of training time, but also bring a negative impact on motion planning performance. One promising research direction is to provide a more effective network framework for DRL-based policies. Along this line of thinking, our paper presents a novel DRL-based motion planning approach called Reconfigurable Structure of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (RS-DDPG) for mobile robots. To account for the poor convergence, the proposed approach first introduces an event-triggered reconfigurable actor-critic network framework for motion policy that adaptively changes its network structure to suppress the overestimation of action value. Then, the time convergence of the motion policy can be enhanced based on the value actions with minor valuation deviation. Afterwards, an adaptive reward mechanism is designed for reconfigurable networks to compensate for the lack of sample information. To deal with the problem of low learning efficiency, we developed a sample pretreatment method for the experience samples, which employs three novel techniques to improve the sample utilization, including a double experience memory buffer, a variable proportional sampling principle, and a similarity judgment mechanism. In extensive experiments, the proposed method outperforms the compared approaches.

J	Läärä, E				Laara, Esa			Statistics: reasoning on uncertainty, and the insignificance of testing null	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI			English	Article							CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; HYPOTHESIS; PICTURES; BIOLOGY; ECOLOGY; SCIENCE; DESIGN; GUIDE; EYE	The practice of statistical analysis and inference in ecology is critically reviewed. The dominant doctrine of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) continues to be applied ritualistically and mindlessly. This dogma is based on superficial understanding of elementary notions of frequentist statistics in the 1930s, and is widely disseminated by influential textbooks targeted at biologists. It is characterized by silly null hypotheses and mechanical dichotomous division of results being "significant" (P < 0.05) or not. Simple examples are given to demonstrate how distant the prevalent NHST malpractice is from the current mainstream practice of professional statisticians. Masses of trivial and meaningless "results" are being reported, which are not providing adequate quantitative information of scientific interest. The NHST dogma also retards progress in the understanding of ecological systems and the effects of management programmes, which may at worst contribute to damaging decisions in conservation biology. In the beginning of this millennium, critical discussion and debate on the problems and shortcomings of NHST has intensified in ecological journals. Alternative approaches, like basic point and interval estimation of effect sizes, likelihood-based and information theoretic methods, and the Bayesian inferential paradigm, have started to receive attention. Much is still to be done in efforts to improve statistical thinking and reasoning of ecologists and in training them to utilize appropriately the expanded statistical toolbox. Ecologists should finally abandon the false doctrines and textbooks of their previous statistical gurus. Instead they should more carefully learn what leading statisticians write and say, collaborate with statisticians in teaching, research, and editorial work in journals.

A 2 (gain vs. loss frame) x 2 (high vs. low uncertainty) x 2 (national vs. local agency) between-subjects experiment was conducted among Houston residents (N = 382). Findings revealed that a loss frame was more effective among participants primed with high uncertainty through a thought-listing task; however, it was less persuasive under conditions of low uncertainty due to increased psychological reactance. Moreover, there was an interaction effect between uncertainty and agency type on vaccine beliefs. The study contributes to the framing literature by identifying psychological uncertainty as a moderator and provides useful suggestions for vaccine message design.

We ask whether COVID-19 reduces turnout intention and how election agencies can mitigate this effect. We use a series of six survey and conjoint experiments implemented in samples totalling over 28,000 Canadian respondents collected between July and November of 2020 to show that: 1) priming people to think about COVID-19 reduces turnout intention, especially among those who feel most threatened by the disease; 2) safety measures for in-person voting, such as mandatory masks and physical distancing, can improve safety perceptions and willingness to vote in-person, and 3) providing people information about safety precautions for in-person voting mitigates the negative effect of priming COVID-19. These studies illustrate the importance of both the implementation and communication of measures by election agencies designed to make people safe - and feel safe - while voting in-person.

However, it is not clear if neuronal activity in this early sensory region contains information about the timing and speed of motor response. To address this question we designed a new task in which freely moving mice learned to associate a whisker stimulus to reward delivery. The task was tailored in such a way that a wide range of delays between whisker stimulation and reward collection were observed due to differences of motivation and perception. After training, mice were anesthetized and neuronal responses evoked by stimulating trained and untrained whiskers were recorded across several cortical columns of barrel cortex. We found a strong correlation between the delay of the mouse behavioral response and the timing of multiunit activity evoked by the trained whisker, outside its principal cortical column, in layers 4 and 5A but not in layer 2/3. Circuit mapping ex vivo revealed this effect was associated with a weakening of layer 4 to layer 2/3 projection. We conclude that the processes controlling the propagation of key sensory inputs to naive cortical columns and the timing of sensory-guided action are linked.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) use can decrease postsurgical blood loss and transfusion requirements. This review aimed to appraise the effects of tourniquet use in TKA for patients with tranexamic acid use. Methods A meta-analysis was conducted to identify relevant randomized controlled trials involving TXA plus a tourniquet (TXA-T group) and use of TXA plus no tourniquet (TXA-NT group) in TKA. Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Library, Highwire, CNKI, and Wanfang database were searched from 2010 through October 2021. Results We identified 1720 TKAs (1690 patients) assessed in 14 randomized controlled trials. Compared with the TXA-NT group, the TXA-T group resulted in less intra-operative blood loss (P < 0.00001) and decreased duration of surgery (P < 0.00001), however more hidden blood loss (P = 0.0004) and less knee range of motion (P < 0.00001). No significant differences were found between two groups in terms of decrease in hemoglobin (P = 0.84), total blood loss (P = 0.79), transfusion rate (P = 0.18), drainage volume (P = 0.06), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at either the day of surgery (P = 0.2), 1 day (P = 0.25), 2 day (P = 0.39), 3 day (P = 0.21), 5 day (P = 0.21), 7 day (P = 0.06) or 1 month after surgery (P = 0.16), Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score at either 7 day (P = 0.10), 1 month (P = 0.08), 3 month (P = 0.22) or 6 month after the surgery (P = 0.92), Knee circumference (P = 0.28), length of hospital (P = 0.12), and complications such as intramuscular venous thrombosis (P = 0.81), deep venous thrombosis (P = 0.10), superficial infection (P = 0.45), deep wound infection (P = 0.64), and delayed wound healing (P = 0.65). Conclusion No big differences could be found by using or not tourniquet when use the TXA, though some benefits are related to operation time and less intra-operative blood loss by using tourniquet and TXA, Using the tourniquet was related to more hidden blood loss and less knee range of motion. More adequately powered and better-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studies with long-term follow-up are required to validate this study.

Presently, PH occurs in 3% to 5% of preterm ventilated infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) who often have a PDA and have received surfactant. The cause of PH is thought to be due to rapid lowering of intrapulmonary pressure, which facilitates left to right shunting across a PDA and an increase in pulmonary blood flow. Retrospective case reports and one prospective uncontrolled study have shown promising results for surfactant in treating PH. Objectives To evaluate the effect of surfactant treatment compared to placebo or no intervention on mortality and morbidities in neonates with PH. Search methods For this update The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2012; MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; Clinicaltrials.gov; Controlled-trials.com; proceedings (2000 to 2011) of the Annual Meetings of the Pediatric Academic Societies (Abstracts2View) and Web of Science were searched on 8 February 2012. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effect of surfactant in the treatment of PH in intubated term or preterm (< 37 weeks) neonates with PH. Infants were included up to 44 weeks' postmenstrual age. The interventions studied were intratracheal instillation of surfactant (natural or synthetic, regardless of dose) versus placebo or no intervention. Data collection and analysis If studies were identified by the literature search, the planned analyses included risk ratio, risk difference, number needed to treat to benefit or to harm for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference for continuous outcomes, with their 95% confidence intervals. A fixed-effect model would be used for meta-analyses. The risk of bias for included trials would be assessed. Heterogeneity tests, including the I-2 statistic, would be performed to assess the appropriateness of pooling the data and the results would be reported. Main results No trials were identified. Authors' conclusions No randomised or quasi-randomised trials that evaluated the effect of surfactant in PH were identified. Therefore, no conclusions from such trials can be drawn. In view of the promising results from studies with less strict study designs than a randomised controlled trial, there is reason to conduct further trials of surfactant for the treatment of PH in neonates.

J	Bucci, DJ; Robinson, S				Bucci, David J.; Robinson, Siobhan			Toward a conceptualization of retrohippocampal contributions to learning and memory	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Review						Hippocampus; Retrosplenial; Postrhinal; Non-spatial; Where pathway	RETROSPLENIAL CORTEX LESIONS; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; OBJECT-PLACE ASSOCIATIONS; POSTRHINAL CORTEX; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL CORTEX; SPATIAL MEMORY; PERIRHINAL CORTEX; CONTEXTUAL ASSOCIATIONS; HEAD-DIRECTION	A wealth of data supports the notion that the hippocampus binds objects and events together in place and time. In support of this function, a cortical circuit that includes the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and various structures in the parahippocampal region is thought to provide the hippocampus with essential information regarding the physical and temporal context in which the object/event occurs. However, it remains unclear if and how individual components of this so-called `where' circuit make unique contributions to processing context-related information. Here we focus on the RSC and the postrhinal cortex (POR; homologous with parahippocampal cortex (PHC) in primates), two of the most strongly interconnected components of the where pathway and the foci of an increasing amount of recent research. Much of the behavioral evidence to date suggests that RSC and POR/PHC work closely together as a functional unit. We begin by briefly reviewing studies that have investigated the involvement of RSC and POR/PHC in contextual and spatial learning, both of which involve learning associations and relationships between the individual stimuli that compose an environment (i.e., where information). However, we propose that potential differences have been overlooked because most studies to date have relied on behavioral paradigms and experimental approaches that are not well suited for distinguishing between different aspects of information processing. We then consider the anatomical differences between RSC and POR/PHC and emerging behavioral evidence that gives rise to a working model of how these regions may differentially contribute to hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. We then discuss experimental designs and behavioral methods that may be useful in testing the model. Finally, approaches are described that may be valuable in probing the nature of information processing and neuroplasticity in the myriad of local circuits that are nested within the where pathway.

However, these comparative studies provided contrasting findings and systematic reviews of RCTs have always considered the SSRIs as a group, and evidence applicable to this group of drugs might not be applicable to paroxetine alone. The present systematic review assessed the efficacy and tolerability profile of paroxetine in comparison with tricyclics (TCAs), SSRIs and newer or non-conventional agents. Objectives 1. To determine the efficacy of paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents in alleviating the acute symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder. 2. To review acceptability of treatment with paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents. 3. To investigate the adverse effects of paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR, to 30 September 2012), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched. Pharmaceutical companies marketing paroxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials allocating participants with major depression to paroxetine versus any other antidepressants (ADs), both conventional (such as TCAs, SSRIs) and newer or non-conventional (such as hypericum). For trials which had a cross-over design, only results from the first randomisation period were considered. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data using a standard form. Data were then entered in RevMan 5.2 with a double-entry procedure. Information extracted included study and participant characteristics, intervention details, settings and efficacy, acceptability and tolerability measures. Main results A total of 115 randomised controlled trials (26,134 participants) were included. In 54 studies paroxetine was compared with older ADs, in 21 studies with another SSRI, and in 40 studies with a newer or non-conventional antidepressant other than SSRIs. For the primary outcome (patients who responded to treatment), paroxetine was more effective than reboxetine at increasing patients who responded early to treatment (Odds Ratio (OR): 0.66, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.87, number needed to treat to provide benefit (NNTb) = 16, 95% CI 10 to 50, at one to four weeks, 3 RCTs, 1375 participants, moderate quality of evidence), and less effective than mirtazapine (OR: 2.39, 95% CI 1.42 to 4.02, NNTb = 8, 95% CI 5 to 14, at one to four weeks, 3 RCTs, 726 participants, moderate quality of evidence). Paroxetine was less effective than citalopram in improving response to treatment (OR: 1.54, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.28, NNTb = 9, 95% CI 5 to 102, at six to 12 weeks, 1 RCT, 406 participants, moderate quality of evidence). We found no clear evidence that paroxetine was more or less effective compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at acute (six to 12 weeks), early (one to four weeks), or longer term follow-up (four to six months). Paroxetine was associated with a lower rate of adverse events than amitriptyline, imipramine and older ADs as a class, but was less well tolerated than agomelatine and hypericum. Included studies were generally at unclear or high risk of bias due to poor reporting of allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessment, and incomplete reporting of outcomes. Authors' conclusions Some possibly clinically meaningful differences between paroxetine and other ADs exist, but no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these findings. In terms of response, there was a moderate quality of evidence that citalopram was better than paroxetine in the acute phase (six to 12 weeks), although only one study contributed data. In terms of early response to treatment (one to four weeks) there was moderate quality of evidence that mirtazapine was better than paroxetine and that paroxetine was better than reboxetine. However there was no clear evidence that paroxetine was better or worse compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at any time point. Even if some differences were identified, the findings from this review are better thought as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be reassuring to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. Finally, most of included studies were at unclear or high risk of bias, and were sponsored by the drug industry. The potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind.

We argue that existing data analytical methods have become insufficient for brain computing when dealing with multiple brain big data sources, because such methods mainly focus on flattening strategies and fail to work well for systematic understanding of the constituent elements of cognition, emotion and disease, as well as the intraand inter-relations within and among themselves. To address this problem, we present in this paper a novel multi-source brain computing platform by Data-Brain driven systematic fusion. First, we formalize a series of behaviors surrounding the Brain Informatics-based investigation process, and present a conceptual model to systematically represent content and context of functional neuroimaging data. Then, we propose the systematic brain computing framework with multi-aspect fusion and inference to understand brain specificity and give uncertainty quantification, as well as its inspiration and applications for translational studies on brain health. In particular, a graph matching-based task search algorithm is introduced to help systematic experimental design and data sampling with multiple cognitive tasks. The study increases the interpretability and transparency of brain computing findings by inferring and testing multiple hypotheses taking into consideration the effect of evidence combination. Finally, multiple sources of knowledge (K), information (I) and data (D) are driven by a KID loop as the thinking space to inspire never-ending learning and multi-dimensional interactions in the connected social-cyber-physical spaces. Experimental results have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed brain computing method with systematic fusion.

Although previous studies have shown that patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have good clinical effects, it remains largely unclear which treatment is more effective for patients with isolated PF-OA. We aimed to compare postoperative function, complications, revision rates, level of physical activity, and satisfaction rate between the two surgical techniques. Methods Our study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Search of literature was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science until November 2020. The included studies were those that provided direct comparison of postoperative outcomes between PFA and TKA. Data were extracted from eligible studies and combined to calculate the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were conducted to evaluate heterogeneity between the two groups. Results A total of 7 eligible studies (3 recent randomized controlled trials and 4 nonrandomized controlled trials) were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that both the PFA group and the TKA group had improved postoperative indicators, suggesting that the two operation modes could improve the knee function and quality of life of patients. Throughout the first 2 years postoperatively, higher activity level, and better functional recovery were observed for PFA compared with TKA in this study; moreover, the differences between the two operation modes were statistically significant (p < 0.05). We found no significant difference in complications, revision rates, and satisfaction rate between the two procedures. Conclusion Although there was no observed difference in the complications, revision rates, and satisfaction rate between PFA and TKA, PFA was superior to TKA in terms of knee function and physical activity in the first 2 years postoperatively. Therefore, PFA is a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment for patients with isolated PF-OA. Our findings are consistent with the systematic review of current evidence that PFA may be more suitable for younger patients with high activity needs. Patient selection is, therefore, thought to be of paramount importance. Individualized surgical plan should be designed according to the patient's age, BMI, KOA site, and activity level and combined with the doctor's personal experience.

Risk factors for PH included severity of illness, intrauterine growth restriction, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), coagulopathy and the need for assisted ventilation. Presently, PH occurs in 3% to 5% of preterm ventilated infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) who often have a PDA and have received surfactant. The cause of PH is thought to be due to rapid lowering of intrapulmonary pressure, which facilitates left to right shunting across a PDA and an increase in pulmonary blood flow.

Infants were included up to 44 weeks' postmenstrual age. The interventions studied were intratracheal instillation of surfactant (natural or synthetic, regardless of dose) versus placebo or no intervention. Data collection and analysis If studies were identified by the literature search, the planned analyses included risk ratio, risk difference, number needed to treat to benefit or to harm for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference for continuous outcomes, with their 95% confidence intervals. A fixed-effect model would be used for meta-analyses. The risk of bias for included trials would be assessed. Heterogeneity tests, including the I-2 statistic, would be performed to assess the appropriateness of pooling the data and the results would be reported. Main results No trials were identified. Authors' conclusions No randomised or quasi-randomised trials that evaluated the effect of surfactant in PH were identified. Therefore, no conclusions from such trials can be drawn. In view of the promising results from studies with less strict study designs than a randomised controlled trial, there is reason to conduct further trials of surfactant for the treatment of PH in neonates.

We explored how smokers responded to cigarette packs which played audio health messages. Methods: Twenty focus groups were conducted in Scotland in 2015 with smokers (n = 120) segmented by age (16-17, 18-24, 25-35, 36-50, >50), gender and social grade. Perceptions of cigarette packs which played audio warnings were explored, with four messages used: (1) a cessation message with a quitline number, (2) mortality message, (3) fertility message, and (4) message about ageing skin. Results: Audio warnings were thought to increase message impact, particularly among younger smokers, as they would be hard to ignore or avoid, and repetition may lead to the messages being memorized. The warnings were considered annoying or embarrassing, and participants suggested they may discard the packs and use alternative storage. Some participants suggested that the audio warnings were off-putting and may alter their smoking behavior, with the mortality message deemed most effective and was considered relatable and felt personal. Older smokers were least likely to believe that audio warnings would affect their smoking behavior, although some thought that they may enhance cessation attempts among smokers seeking to quit, and could deter new or potential smokers, for example, young people. Conclusions: Cigarette packs with audio messaging may have a role to play, now or in the future, as a novel way of communicating health and cessation information.

J	Chen, B				Chen, Bo			Abnormal cortical region and subsystem complexity in dynamical functional connectivity of chronic schizophrenia: A new graph index for fMRI analysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Resting-state functional MRI; Dynamical functional connectivity; Topology entropy; Chronic schizophrenia	OLFACTORY-BULB VOLUME; ULTRA-HIGH-RISK; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL GYRUS; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; BRAIN PLASTICITY; NETWORKS; HIPPOCAMPAL; 1ST-EPISODE; RECONFIGURATION; DISORDER	Objectives: Schizophrenia is a predominant product of pathological alterations distributed throughout interconnected neural systems. Designing new objectively diagnostic methods are burning questions. Dynamical functional connectivity (DFCs) methodology based on fMRI data is an effective lever to investigate changeability evolution in macroscopic neural activity patterns underlying critical aspects of cognition and behavior. However, region properties of brain architecture have been less investigated by special indexes of dynamical graph in general mental disorders. Methods: Embracing the network dynamics concept, we introduce topology entropy index (TE-scores) which is focused on time-varying aspects of FCs, hence develop a new framework for researching the dysfunctional roots of schizophrenia in holism significance. In this work, the important process is to uncover noticeable regions endowed with antagonistic stance in TE-scores of between morbid and normal DFCs of 63 healthy controls (HCs) and 57 chronic schizophrenia patients (SZs). Results: For the whole brain region levels, right olfactory, right hippocampus, left parahippocampal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, left amygdala, and left cuneus in SZs are endowed with significantly different TE-scores. At brain subsystems level, TE-scores in DMN are abnormal in the SZs. Comparison with existing method(s): Topology entropy in DFCs is introduced to explore the dynamical information organization of diverse regions and their abnormal changes in mental illness. Several classical graph indexes (such as degree strength, betweenness, centrality) in the static brain network measure the region importance of FCs under senses of information integration and separation process. Although highly related to degree strength by comparing the corresponding values, topology entropy further explores the regions' aberrant adaptability of functional contact and function switching. Conclusion: TE-scores of abnormal regions in SZs are associated to the passive apathetic social withdrawal, unusual thought content, disturbance of volition, preoccupation, active social avoidance and hallucinatory symptoms. Thought the strict contrastive study, it is worth stressing that topology entropy is a meaningful biological marker to excavating schizophrenic psychopathology.

Rare disease patients often experience delayed diagnosis, misdiagnosis, or improper treatment, which may be due to the lack of rare disease awareness among physicians.Materials and methodsA total of 224 physicians from different hospitals in China participated in the questionnaire, and 9 rare disease experts were interviewed with open-ended questions.ResultsMost physicians (83.5%) were from Tertiary hospitals, which have over 500 beds. Only 5.3% of physicians were moderately or well aware of rare diseases. Most physicians (80.1%) had suspected their patients to have rare diseases less than 3 times. There was a strong support for special legislations for rare diseases and orphan drugs. Further, multinomial logistic regression (MLR) was used to determine whether hospitals, gender, and career length has an impact on perspectives and awareness. It was shown that male physicians were more likely to think newborn screening is important (p<0.05). The longer the career length is, the more likely physicians believe that their previous education has not provided sufficient information about rare diseases and that their hospital has paid enough attention to rare diseases. Physicians from Tertiary A hospitals were more likely to rate the affordability of orphan drugs high. In addition, nine experts believed that rare disease awareness is essential for early diagnosis and timely treatment. These experts also made recommendations on how to improve rare disease awareness through medical school education and continuing training.ConclusionsOur study highlighted the importance of improving rare disease awareness among physicians in China. Recommendations about how to improve rare disease awareness in medical school education and establish an online 'information hub' are made for considerations of policy-makers.

The module allows equitable experiences for students studying in person at the University of York, at a university abroad, or undertaking an industrial placement. Distinctively, the module was designed around the use of modern research papers, published by Chemistry at York researchers, as vehicles of information. The approach allowed students to apply chemical principles learned in earlier years of their course to the solution of problems at the forefront of five chemistry specialisms, ranging from atmospheric and environmental, to physical chemistry. Learning objectives included an appreciation of the experimental and analytical techniques used in the research, as well as the development of scientific literacy and critical thinking skills. There was also an opportunity for students to develop communication skills through an optional competition. Staff collaborated with students as partners in the development of course content, as well as establishing student workload, and testing formative assessments. Student attitudes toward the module were monitored, which demonstrated an enthusiasm for the approach and coverage of material. The flexibility to work through the content at their own pace, at a time to suit them, was appreciated by students as a whole and highlighted in disabled students' feedback. Challenges remain in engaging students to learn theoretical courses while wanting to focus on their individual capstone research projects. Assessment of students' problem-solving skills by an in-person or online examination resulted in a consistent examination performance.

Therefore, N gene has long been thought an ideal target for the design of small interference RNA (siRNA). siRNA is a class of small non-coding RNAs with a size of 21-25nt that functions post-transcriptionally to block targeted gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the N gene coding sequences derived from 16 different isolates, and found that nucleotide deletions and substitutions are mainly located at the first 440nt sequence. Combining previous reports and the above sequence information, we create three novel siRNAs that specifically target the conserved and unexploited regions in the N gene. We show that these siRNAs could effectively and specifically block the isolated N gene expression in mammal cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence to show that N gene can effectively up-regulate M gene mediated interferon. (IFN.) production, while blocking N gene expression by specific siRNA significantly reduces IFN. gene expression. Our data indicate that the inhibitory effect of siRNA on the isolated N gene expression might be influenced by the sequence context around the targeted sites.

J	Kim, Y; Huh, JH; Chung, M				Kim, Yonghoon; Huh, Jun-Ho; Chung, Mokdong			Traffic Inference System Using Correlation Analysis with Various Predicted Big Data	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Big Data analysis; Latent Semantic Analysis; FCM; correlation analysis; traffic volume		Currently, most of the transportation systems require changes to intelligent transportation systems, but most of them focus on efficient transportation rather than on improvement in human life. Sometimes, traffic systems are designed for economic value, and safety-related issues are neglected. A traffic information system that reflects various kinds of environmental information related to people's safety must be able to reflect not only the existing economic goals but also a safe traffic environment. The traffic environment can be thought of as safety and direct information such as rainfall, including information on specific days when many people are scheduled to be gathered for certain events nearby. Intelligent transportation systems using this information can provide safety-related information for traveling to a specific area or for business trips. In addition, traffic congestion is a social problem and is directly related to a comfort life for individuals. Therefore, addressing various social and environmental factors could make human life more stable and reduce stress as a result. To do that, we need to estimate the impact on traffic based on environmental Big Data. The data can generally be divided into structured data and unstructured data. In inference, structured data analysis is relatively easy due to the precise meaning of the data. Nonetheless, it can be very difficult to predict environmentally sensitive data, such as traffic volume in intelligent transportation systems. To cope with this problem, there are a few systems for handling unstructured data to find out specific events that affect the traffic volume and improve its reliability. This paper shows that it is possible to estimate the exact volume of traffic using correlation analysis with various predicted data. Thus, we may apply this technique to the existing intelligent transportation system to predict the exact volume of traffic with environmentally sensitive data including various unstructured data.

The establishment of two new types of host-guest recognition building blocks (21-crown-7/secondary ammonium salt and pillar[5]arene/alkyl chain) for supramolecular polymers. How do you get into this specific field? Could you please share some experiences with our readers? I got my introduction to supramolecular chemistry during the postgraduate period. There are many phenomena closely related to the weak non-covalent interactions in nature, such as the storage and transmission of genetic information through the DNA double helix structure. Inspired by these fascinating natural phenomena, scientists try to use non-covalent interactions to prepare many very complex self-assembled systems including supramolecular polymers from natural and artificially designed structural units. In 1987, Lehn, Cram, and Pederson won the Nobel Prize for their contribution to supramolecular chemistry. At present, supra- molecular chemistry has developed into an emerging discipline formed by the intersection of chemistry, physics, life sciences, materials science, and electronic engineering.

Self-assembly is a topic of intense scientific interest. Supramolecular polymers are one of the most important research directions in the field of chemical self-assembly. As a novel kind of polymeric systems, supramolecular polymers are still in the early stage of their development. There are three fundamental scientific problems: How to expand host-guest recognition building blocks? How to realize the control of the structures of supramolecular polymers at multiple levels? And how to realize multi-stimuli responsivenesses of supramolecular polymers? To address these scientific problems, we constructed a series of novel supramolecular polymers based on host-guest recognition.

Physician attitudes toward regionalization of adult critical care: A national survey	CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						patient transfer; triage; intensive care; mechanical ventilation; healthcare systems	LUNG-PROTECTIVE VENTILATION; PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE-CARE; UNITED-STATES; HOSPITAL MORTALITY; FAMILY-MEMBERS; RESPONSE RATES; VOLUME; BARRIERS; ORGANIZATION; OUTCOMES	Objective: Regionalization has been proposed as a method to improve outcomes for patients with critical illness. We sought to determine intensivist physician attitudes and potential barriers to the regionalization of adult critical care. Design: Mail survey. Setting. United States. Subjects: Actively practicing physicians specializing in adult critical care, emergency medicine, or internal medicine listed in the 2008 American Medical Association Physician Masterfile (n = 1200). Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: There were 569 eligible respondents (effective response rate = 53.0%). Respondents were similar to nonrespondents. Fifty-nine percent of respondents thought their hospital would mainly receive patients under a regionalized system, and 30% thought their hospital would mainly send patients. Opinions were split about whether regionalization would improve overall patient survival (52% agreed) and healthcare efficiency (66% agreed). Specialists in anesthesiology and surgery-critical care, academic physicians, and physicians who perceived that they would mainly receive patients were more likely to believe that regionalization would improve outcomes and efficiency (p < 0.001). The most commonly endorsed barriers to regionalization were personal strain on patient's families (66% agreed), current lack of a strong central authority (64% agreed), and the potential to overwhelm capacity at large hospitals (55% agreed). Commonly endorsed strategies to implement regionalization included using objective criteria to determine eligibility for transfer (87% agreed), developing common information technology platforms across hospitals (86% agreed), and demonstrating in a clinical trial that regionalization is beneficial (81% agreed). Conclusions: Intensivist physicians have mixed opinions about regionalization, with little consensus about whether regionalization will improve outcomes. Most felt that regionalization will improve patient outcomes, but many expressed concerns about unintended adverse consequences. Respondents identified several barriers and potential implementation strategies that can help policymakers design a regionalized system of critical care in the United States.

High-Throughput Assay Development for Cystine-Glutamate Antiporter (x<sub>c</sub><SUP>-</SUP>) Highlights Faster Cystine Uptake than Glutamate Release in Glioma Cells	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN-DIPLOID FIBROBLASTS; PRIMARY BRAIN-TUMORS; FACTOR-KAPPA-B; SYSTEM X(C)(-); OXIDATIVE STRESS; CYSTINE/GLUTAMATE ANTIPORTER; MALIGNANT GLIOMAS; INHIBITION; TRANSPORT; GROWTH	The cystine-glutamate antiporter (system x(c)(-)) is a Na+-independent amino acid transporter that exchanges extracellular cystine for intracellular glutamate. It is thought to play a critical role in cellular redox processes through regulation of intracellular glutathione synthesis via cystine uptake. In gliomas, system x(c)(-) expression is universally up-regulated while that of glutamate transporters down-regulated, leading to a progressive accumulation of extracellular glutamate and excitotoxic cell death of the surrounding non-tumorous tissue. Additionally, up-regulation of system x(c)(-) in activated microglia has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders mediated by excess glutamate. Consequently, system x(c)(-) is a new drug target for brain cancer and neuroinflammatory diseases associated with excess extracellular glutamate. Unfortunately no potent and selective small molecule system x(c)(-) inhibitors exist and to our knowledge, no high throughput screening (HTS) assay has been developed to identify new scaffolds for inhibitor design. To develop such an assay, various neuronal and non-neuronal human cells were evaluated as sources of system x(c)(-). Human glioma cells were chosen based on their high system x(c)(-) activity. Using these cells, [C-14]-cystine uptake and cystine-induced glutamate release assays were characterized and optimized with respect to cystine and protein concentrations and time of incubation. A pilot screen of the LOPAC/NINDS libraries using glutamate release demonstrated that the logistics of the assay were in place but unfortunately, did not yield meaningful pharmacophores. A larger, HTS campaign using the 384-well cystine-induced glutamate release as primary assay and the 96-well C-14-cystine uptake as confirmatory assay is currently underway. Unexpectedly, we observed that the rate of cystine uptake was significantly faster than the rate of glutamate release in human glioma cells. This was in contrast to the same rates of cystine uptake and glutamate release previously reported in normal human fibroblast cells.

The issue that how to correctly decoding the pathological information from EEG has been attracting a lot of interest. This paper creates a robust feature extraction scheme based on synchrosqueezing short-time Fourier transform (SSTFT) and graph regularized non-negative matrix factorization (GNMF), which is applied to epileptic EEG detection. The SSTFT is employed to analyze the EEG in time-frequency domain, followed by a GNMF decomposition that maps these components into a low-dimensional representation where latent clues are easily emphasized and learned, and finally the logarithmic energy, computed as features, is fed to a fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor classifier for the purpose of discriminating seizure events. Our method is evaluated using two public databases including Bonn database and CHB-MIT database. Obtained results confirm the superiority of the proposed features by achieving classification accuracy of at least 98.0% for both short-term and long-term EEG recordings. It is expected to offer a new thought and perspective for the study and design of the automatic EEG monitoring system.

However, only a few studies have examined these factors using information from large databases. We examined the data on 11,905 Swiss conscripts from 2003. All cases with high psychiatric screening scores indicating "caseness" for a psychiatric disorder were excluded, among them potential malingerers, so that 9,814 records remained. The analyses rely on self-reported information about stuttering in childhood, problems at birth, problems in school, mental disorders of parents and relatives, childhood adversity and socio-demographic information. Statistical modelling was done using logistic regression and path analysis models. Risk factors determined in the logistic regression include premature birth, probable attention deficit hyperactive disorder, alcohol abuse of the parents, obsessive-compulsive disorder in parents and relatives, having a disabled mother and having a parent from a foreign country. There is no overwhelmingly strong risk factor; all odds ratios are about 2 or below. In conclusion, large databases are helpful in revealing less obvious and less frequent risk factors for heterogeneous disorders such as stuttering. Obviously, not only secondary analyses, but also systematical large scale studies would be required to complete the complex epidemiological puzzle in stuttering. An extensive examination of young adults who were initially assessed in childhood might provide the most promising design.

The pitfalls of wildlife camera trapping as a survey tool in Australia	AUSTRALIAN MAMMALOGY			English	Review						camera trap constraints; critical review; remote cameras	INFRARED DIGITAL CAMERAS; GROUND-DWELLING MAMMALS; NEW-SOUTH-WALES; DASYURUS-MACULATUS; ACTIVITY PATTERNS; NEST PREDATORS; TIGER QUOLL; IDENTIFICATION; ABUNDANCE; BAIT	Camera trapping is a relatively new addition to the wildlife survey repertoire in Australia. Its rapid adoption has been unparalleled in ecological science, but objective evaluation of camera traps and their application has not kept pace. With the aim of motivating practitioners to think more about selection and deployment of camera trap models in relation to research goals, we reviewed Australian camera trapping studies to determine how camera traps have been used and how their technological constraints may have affected reported results and conclusions. In the 54 camera trapping articles published between 1991 and 2013, mammals (86%) were studied more than birds (10%) and reptiles (3%), with small to medium-sized mammals being most studied. Australian camera trapping studies, like those elsewhere, have changed from more qualitative to more complex quantitative investigations. However, we found that camera trap constraints and limitations were rarely acknowledged, and we identified eight key issues requiring consideration and further research. These are: camera model, camera detection system, camera placement and orientation, triggering and recovery, camera trap settings, temperature differentials, species identification and behavioural responses of the animals to the cameras. In particular, alterations to animal behaviour by camera traps potentially have enormous influence on data quality, reliability and interpretation. The key issues were not considered in most Australian camera trap papers and require further study to better understand the factors that influence the analysis and interpretation of camera trap data and improve experimental design.

While users can share resources they want in a P2P, there are also many resources they do not want such as fake contents. As one method of removing fake contents, it is suggested to use collective intelligence in P2P environment. This study is intended to design an efficient contents reputation system using dynamic users collective intelligence in P2P environment. Collective intelligence has been applied to decision making more importantly thinks to the emergence of new information and communication technology and experts use this term to create a noble insight by combining a group of peoples behaviors, selection and ideas. Collecting a group of peoples decision making allows one to induce a statistical conclusion individuals does not know.

Previous studies have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can restore vigilance and information processing after SD. However, the underlying neural mechanisms of this phenomenon remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms of tDCS following SD, by comparing changes in the brain network, especially the thalamocortical network, after tDCS and sham stimulation following 24 h of SD. Sixteen healthy volunteers were tested in a sham-controlled, randomized crossover design experiment. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted during resting wakefulness and again after either active tDCS or sham stimulation to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (1.0 mA, 20 min) immediately following 24 h of SD. Seed-based correlations and graph theory analysis were used to determine functional connectivity within the brain thalamocortical network. When tDCS was used, the functional connectivity of the thalamus with the temporal lobe and left caudate was higher than that when the sham stimulation was used. Analysis using graph theory showed that compared with sham stimulation, tDCS administration was associated with a significant improvement in not only the number of connections but also the global efficiency of the thalamus itself. Our study reveals a modulation of the activity of the intrinsic thalamus networks after tDCS. The effects may help explain earlier reports of improvements in the cognitive performance after anodal-tDCS.

Yet little research has examined the underlying neural substrates of this phenomenon, which is known as the 'continued influence effect of misinformation' (CIEM). It remains unclear how the human brain processes critical information that retracts prior claims. To address this question in further detail, 26 healthy adults underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while listening to brief narratives which either involved a retraction of prior information or not. Following each narrative, subjects' comprehension of the narrative, including their inclination to rely on retracted information, was probed. As expected, it was found that retracted information continued to affect participants' narrative-related reasoning. In addition, the fMRI data indicated that the continued influence of retracted information may be due to a breakdown of narrative-level integration and coherence-building mechanisms implemented by the precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus.

Methods: Web of Science Core Collection, Medline, BIOSIS Citation Index, KCI-Korean Journal Database, SciELO Citation Index, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched to include randomized controlled trials of MBIs for depressive rumination that met the criteria. The Rumination Scale was used as the primary outcome indicator; Depression, mindfulness, and anxiety indexes were selected as the secondary outcome indicators. An evaluation of bias risk was conducted to identify possible sources of bias based on methodological and clinical factors. RevMan5.3 software was used to perform a meta-analysis of the extracted data. Results: Nineteen studies with 1138 patients were included. Meta-analysis showed that MBIs could significantly reduce rumination levels in patients with depression (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.46; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.58, -0.34; p < 0.001), notably improve depression (SMD = -0.58; 95% CI: -0.83, -0.32; p < 0.001), enhance mindfulness ability (SMD = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.57, 1.32; p < 0.001), and reduce the anxiety of patients with depression (SMD = -0.45, 95% CI: -0.62, -0.27; p < 0.001). MBIs conducted in Asia improved rumination better than studies in Europe and North America (SMD = -2.05 95% CI: -4.08, -0.01; p < 0.001) but had no greater effect than behavior activation on depression. The interventions carried out in the past 5 years were significantly better than earlier studies in improving mindfulness levels (SMD = 2.74; 95% CI: 0.81, 4.66; p = 0.005). Conclusions: MBIs are effective in the treatment of depression as they produce pleasant improvement in rumination and depression, decrease the degree of anxiety, and enhance mindfulness levels compared to controls. In newer forms of MBIs, regional differences need to be considered when designing the intervention program. More large, high-quality randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm the conclusion that the effectiveness of MBIs has differences in terms of the trial area and year of publication.

However, for elderly users whose learning has traditionally been based on linear models of information such as textbooks, unfamiliarity with Internet can be a barrier. Moreover, elderly people living in rural communities face a lack of telecommunication infrastructures, which increases their difficulties in accessing ICTs. The aim of this study is to test a social network consisting of multiple applications with linear navigation as a digital literacy method for the elderly in rural areas. A sample of 46 participants between 60-76 years old with heterogeneous previous experience with ICTs participated in the study. They performed eight standardized sessions in an Elderly Leisure Center. Results showed differences in perceived usefulness between users with high and low ICT experience. After eight training sessions, the majority of the participants were able to independently use all the system applications, and positive results were obtained on the variables measured, i.e., learnability, sense of control over the system, ability to use the system, orientation, efficiency, accessible design, perceived ease, perceived usefulness, and intention to use. The participants with previous experience with other ICT methods preferred the linear navigation method because they thought it was easier than other ICTs. The results showed interaction differences when touch screens were used. Qualitative results showed that one of the most frequent emotions at the beginning of the ICT sessions was "fear" (related to breaking the computer or to making fools of themselves), but the continued use of the system improved the users' perceptions of their own capacity to handle ICTs and their interest in ICTs in general. The main contribution of this work consists of exploring the usefulness of linear navigation and social network systems in the context of digital literacy for elderly users in rural areas.

Therefore, in the present study, we examined whether suicidal ideation and beliefs highlighted in theories of suicide are related to positive/negative interpretation bias and/or a bias against revising negative interpretations in response to evidence against them (negative interpretation inflexibility). Data were collected in three waves, each 1 week apart. Network analyses and structural equation models provided evidence that negative interpretation bias (cross-sectionally) and negative interpretation inflexibility (cross-sectionally and over time) were related to suicidal ideation and that the latter relationship was mediated by perceived burdensomeness. By identifying this mediation pathway in the present study, we provide a potential mechanism by which perceptions of burdensomeness, a key risk factor for suicidality, might arise and/or persist.

Neurophysiological Indices of Audiovisual Speech Processing Reveal a Hierarchy of Multisensory Integration Effects	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						CCA; EEG; hierarchical processing; multisensory integration; speech in noise; speech in quiet	CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; VISUAL SPEECH; NEURAL RESPONSES; PERCEPTION; ORGANIZATION; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; ACTIVATION	Seeing a speaker's face benefits speech comprehension, especially in challenging listening conditions. This perceptual benefit is thought to stem from the neural integration of visual and auditory speech at multiple stages of processing, whereby movement of a speaker's face provides temporal cues to auditory cortex, and articulatory information from the speaker's mouth can aid recognizing specific linguistic units (e.g., phonemes, syllables). However, it remains unclear how the integration of these cues varies as a function of listening conditions. Here, we sought to provide insight on these questions by examining EEG responses in humans (males and females) to natural audiovisual (AV), audio, and visual speech in quiet and in noise. We represented our speech stimuli in terms of their spectrograms and their phonetic features and then quantified the strength of the encoding of those features in the EEG using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The encoding of both spectrotemporal and phonetic features was shown to be more robust in AV speech responses than what would have been expected from the summation of the audio and visual speech responses, suggesting that multisensory integration occurs at both spectrotemporal and phonetic stages of speech processing. We also found evidence to suggest that the integration effects may change with listening conditions; however, this was an exploratory analysis and future work will be required to examine this effect using a within-subject design. These findings demonstrate that integration of audio and visual speech occurs at multiple stages along the speech processing hierarchy.

PCI Choice Decision Aid for Stable Coronary Artery Disease A Randomized Trial	CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR QUALITY AND OUTCOMES			English	Article						coronary artery disease; decision making, shared; decision support techniques; patient-centered care; percutaneous coronary intervention	PRIMARY-CARE; INVOLVE PATIENTS; MEDICAL THERAPY; INTERVENTION; PERCEPTIONS; ANGIOGRAPHY; GUIDELINE; BARRIERS; EXTENT	Background-Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for stable coronary artery disease does not reduce the risk of death and myocardial infarction compared with optimal medical therapy (OMT), but many patients think otherwise. PCI Choice, a decision aid (DA), was designed for use during the clinical visit and includes information on quality of life and mortality outcomes for PCI with OMT versus OMT alone for stable coronary artery disease. Methods and Results-We conducted a randomized trial to assess the impact of the PCI Choice DA compared with usual care when there is a choice between PCI and optimal medical therapy. Primary outcomes were patient knowledge and decisional conflict, and the secondary outcome was an objective measure of shared decision making. A total of 124 patients were eligible for final analysis. Knowledge was higher among patients receiving the DA compared with usual care (60% DA; 40% usual care; P = 0.034), and patients felt more informed (P = 0.043). Other measures of decisional quality were not improved, and engagement of the patient by the clinician in shared decision making did not change with use of the DA. There was evidence that clinicians used the DA as an educational tool. Conclusions-The PCI Choice DA improved patient knowledge but did not significantly impact decisional quality. Further work is needed to effectively address clinician knowledge gaps in shared decision-making skills, even in the context of carefully designed DAs.

Previous studies have identified that the frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex in the cognitive control network selectively activated in response to chunk tightness, however, functional localization strategy may overlook the interaction brain regions. Based on the notion of a global brain network, we proposed that multiple specialized regions have to be interconnected to maintain goal representation during the course of chunk decomposition. Therefore, the present study applied a beta-series correlation method to investigate interregional functional connectivity in the event-related design of chunk decomposition tasks using Chinese characters, which would highlight critical nodes irrespective to chunk tightness. The results reveal a network of functional hubs with highly within or between module connections, including the orbitofrontal cortex, superior/inferior parietal lobule, hippocampus, and thalamus. We speculate that the thalamus integrates information across modular as an integrative hub while the orbitofrontal cortex tracks the mental states of chunk decomposition on a moment-to-moment basis. The superior and inferior parietal lobule collaborate to manipulate the mental representation of chunk decomposition and the hippocampus associates the relationship between elements in the question and solution phase. Furthermore, the tightness of chunks is not only associated with different processors in visual systems but also leads to increased intermodular connections in right superior frontal gyrus and left precentral gyrus. To summary up, the present study first reveals the task modulated brain network of chunk decomposition in addition to the tightness-related nodes in the frontal and occipital cortex.

A Wizard of Oz study to test emotional vs. rational persuasion strategies in dialogues	COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Persuasion; Wizard of Oz; Dialogue; Emotional; Rational	THINK	This research explores ideal methods of persuasion through computer-mediated dialogue. We attempt to identify which persuasive strategy is most successful. We designed a Wizard of Oz laboratory experiment, where participants interact with a human wizard via a custom-developed web-based chat interface. The wizard attempted to persuade participants to learn more about Tai Chi using the following persuasive strategies: Emotional Positive, Emotional Negative, Rational Positive, and Rational Negative. Based on the results of the pre- and post-chat questionnaire, participants' interest in learning Tai Chi was significantly greater after completing the dialogue and 69% percent of the participants printed a flyer to receive more information. Furthermore, conversations using the Emotional Positive strategies resulted in more successful persuasion than rational ones. The results of our study suggest that Emotional Positive strategies may be the most effective. We also suggest successful strategies as a design guideline for autonomous dialogue systems for persuasion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evidence from a fixed effects approach	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Perceived social mobility; Subjective social mobility; Health psychology; Physical health; Psychological wellbeing; Polish panel survey; Hybrid effects; Poland	SELF-RATED HEALTH; PHYSICAL HEALTH; DETERMINANTS; SELECTION; PERCEPTIONS; CAUSATION; HAPPINESS; INDEX	Rationale: The question as to whether changing one's socioeconomic position over the life course affects health has not been answered in a conclusive manner. At the same time, it has been established that individuals who think of themselves that they are higher in the social hierarchy are healthier than those who think otherwise. Objective: In this study, we focus on perceived social mobility to shed new light on the issue of how social mobility affects health. We examine whether perceived social mobility, i.e., an individual's appraisal of doing better or worse than their parents, affects health by analyzing longitudinal data from Poland. Methods: Using a fixed effects approach to account for all time-invariant and important time-varying confounders, we analyze the Polish Panel Survey which has been collecting data on participants' social mobility perceptions along with information on their self-reported physical health and psychological wellbeing. Results: We find that perceived social mobility is a significant predictor of self-reported physical health and psychological wellbeing, even in models that adjust for a host of theoretically relevant control variables. The results demonstrate that upward subjective mobility has a consistent and strong positive effect on health outcomes. The effect of perceived social mobility is stronger for males and for those with less advantageous social origins. Conclusions: Our findings are in line with the "from rags to riches" theoretical perspective, emphasizing the positive implications of upward social mobility on health through various psychological mechanisms. Based on our findings, we call for greater scholarly attention to subjective aspects of social mobility in research on health outcomes.

Study design Prospective observational study of TOLAC-eligible women at 26-34 weeks gestation. Preferences (utilities) were elicited using the time trade-off and standard gamble metrics. Logistic regression was used to identify preference- and attitude-based factors associated with TOLAC. Results Of the 231 participants, most (n = 197, 85%) preferred vaginal delivery, but only 40% (n = 93) underwent TOLAC. Utilities for uterine rupture outcomes did not differ based on delivery approach. In multivariable analysis, strength of preference for vaginal delivery, value for the experience of labor, and the opinion of the person whom the participant thought of as most important to this decision were associated with TOLAC. Conclusions Future decision support interventions incorporating individualized information regarding the likelihood of vaginal birth and empowering patients to express their preferences and engage their families in the decision-making process may improve decision quality and increase TOLAC rates.

The formation of non-B DNA structures during some biological processes is thought as a causative factor for repeat expansions. Yet, the structural basis for these pyrimidine-rich ATTTT and ATTTC repeat expansions remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the solution structures of ATTTT and ATTTC repeats using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Here, we reveal that ATTTT and ATTTC repeats can form a highly compact minidumbbell structure at the 5'-end using their first two repeats. The high-resolution structure of two ATTTT repeats was determined, showing a regular TTTTA pentaloop and a quasi TTTT/A pentaloop. Furthermore, the minidumbbell structure could escape from proofreading by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I when it was located at five or more base pairs away from the priming site, leading to a small-scale repeat expansion. Results of this work improve our understanding of ATTTT and ATTTC repeat expansions in SCA37 and FAMEs, and provide high-resolution structural information for rational drug design.

Emergence of PfART-R in Africa would result in a major public health problem. In this systematic review, we investigate the frequency and spatial distribution of Pfkelch13 mutants in Africa, including mutants linked to PfART-R in southeast Asia. Seven databases were searched (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, African Journal Online, African Index Medicus, Bioline, and Web of Science) for relevant articles about polymorphisms of the Pfkelch13 gene in Africa before January, 2019. Following PRISMA guidelines, 53 studies that sequenced the Pfkelch13 gene of 23 100 sample isolates in 41 sub-Saharan African countries were included. The Pfkelch13 sequence was highly polymorphic (292 alleles, including 255 in the Pfkelch13-propeller domain) but with mutations occurring at very low relative frequencies. Non-synonymous mutations were found in only 626 isolates (2.7%) from west, central, and east Africa. According to WHO, nine different mutations linked to PfART-R in southeast Asia (Phe446Ile, Cys469Tyr, Met476Ile, Arg515Lys, Ser522Cys, Pro553Leu, Val568Gly, Pro574Leu, and Ala675Val) were detected, mainly in east Africa. Several other Pfkelch13 mutations, such as those structurally similar to southeast Asia PfART-R mutations, were also identified, but their relevance for drug resistance is still unknown. This systematic review shows that Africa, thought to not have established PfART-R, reported resistance-related mutants in the past 5 years. Surveillance using PfART-R molecular markers can provide valuable decision-making information to sustain the effectiveness of artemisinin in Africa.

At 1 atm and 295 K, the gravimetric C2H2 adsorption uptakes reach 187, 213 and 193 cm(3) (STP) g(-1) for these three compounds. The gravimetric C2H2 adsorption amount of ZJNU-47a is the second highest reported for MOF materials. Notably, despite their same porosities, and densities of open metal sites and uncoordinated nitrogen sites, distinctly different C2H2 adsorption capacities were observed for these three compounds, which we think are mainly associated with the difference in the relative position of nitrogen atoms leading to different binding affinities of the frameworks towards C2H2 guest molecules, and thus different C2H2 adsorptions. This work demonstrates that the rational arrangement of open nitrogen sites will favorably improve the C2H2 uptake and thus provides useful information for future design of porous MOFs with high acetylene storage capacities.

J	Darling-Aduana, J				Darling-Aduana, Jennifer			Authenticity, engagement, and performance in online high school courses: Insights from micro-interactional data	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Distance education and online learning; Pedagogical issues; Secondary education	STUDENT; MATHEMATICS; KNOWLEDGE; PATTERNS; INQUIRY; SUPPORT; IMPACT	Increased reliance on online course-taking in high school may have a negative impact on educational opportunity gaps by exposing students belonging to marginalized subgroups to a pedagogy of poverty. Employing a mixed method design, I documented the prevalence and form of authentic work in asynchronous, vendor-developed online courses used primarily for credit-recovery in a large, urban school district serving a predominately low-income, minoritized student body. Rather than facilitating higher-order thinking and providing real-world relevance, lessons most often required students to recite information. However, through qualitative analysis, I identified that some types of authentic work were feasible within the asynchronous online course structure through the integration of student-directed research, writing-based tasks, and interactive assignments. The identification of only small magnitude associations with achievement indicates that authentic work should be viewed less in terms of closing the achievement gap and more as necessary to remedy the opportunity gap. Findings identify instructional practices likely to improve the authenticity, rigor, and relevance of students' educational experiences online.

J	Albo, Y; Lanir, J; Rafaeli, S				Albo, Yael; Lanir, Joel; Rafaeli, Sheizaf			A Conceptual Framework for Visualizing Composite Indicators	SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH			English	Article						Framework; Visualization; Composite indicator	BENCHMARKING; ANIMATION	Composite indicators (CIs) are common measurements and benchmarking tools used to measure multidimensional concepts such as well-being, education and more. Indicators and sub-indicators are selected and combined to reflect a measured phenomenon. Measurement iterations produce a series of time-oriented data, which stakeholders, as well as the general public, might be interested in interpreting. Visualization of a CI is highly recommended, in order to facilitate interpretation and enhance understanding of indicator components and their evolution over time. In recent years, a variety of CI visualizations have been published including various visualization techniques. Indeed, visualizing a CI is a complex and challenging issue, involving many design choices. However, there is a lack of guidelines and methodological approaches for CI visualization design. We suggest a framework that provides a systematic way of thinking of CI visualizations. The framework is intended for two uses: as a design tool when constructing a new CI visualization, and as an analytic tool for systematically describing, comparing and evaluating CI visualizations. The suggested framework is the outcome of both a top-down process, based on CI construction and information visualization literature, and a bottom-up process, in which 35 existing visualization applications of popular CIs were analyzed. We use Munzner's visualization analysis and design framework (Munzner in Visualization analysis and design, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2014) in an adaptive way, considering the specific challenges and characteristics of CI visualizations, in order to develop and discuss a systematic view of the data, tasks and methods for visualizing CIs. We demonstrate the use of the framework with a case study analyzing the popular OECD Better Life Index visualization tool.

Design and methods: This study employed a qualitative case study approach. It was conducted in three paediatric units in a Jordanian hospital. Each case comprised a child aged 1-12 years with a condition eligible for palliative care who received health care in one of these units, and their most involved carers (e.g. mother, physician and nurse). Two data collection methods were employed: participant observation and semi-structured interviews with three categories of participants: mothers, physicians, and nurses. Ethical approval was obtained from the hospital ethical review board. Written consent was obtained from all participants. Results: Qualitative case studies were developed around 15 children (aged 1-12 years, nine were boys and six were girls, with varying diagnoses: renal disease, neurological conditions, and congenital heart defects). A total of 197 observational hours and 60 interviews were completed (15 mothers, 12 physicians and 21 nurses). The findings demonstrate that the practice of 'mutual protection' dominated communication between children, parents and clinical staff. Parents protected their children by disclosing only partial information about their disease, and by avoiding any information they thought would cause the child distress or loss of hope. Similarly, children avoided expression to their parents of their anxieties or fears, in order to protect them. In turn, nurses attempted to ensure observance of professional boundaries with children and mothers to avoid a sense of loss when a child died. Conclusion: The findings of the current study indicate that while open and honest communication between parents and children is generally recommended by literature, not all mothers agree with adopting open communication with their children concerning their illnesses. Therefore, any future intervention planned for them should respect parents' autonomy and decisions in addition to their cultural backgrounds. Practical implications: The provision of ongoing education and specialised training for professionals to provide them with culturally sensitive skills in communication and provision of emotional support for children and parents is needed to improve clinical practice in healthcare settings with limited access to specialist palliative care such as Jordan.

Structure-function relationships of cholesterol mobilization from the endo-lysosome compartment of NPC1-deficient human cells by ß- CD polyrotaxanes	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HEPARAN-SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN; NIEMANN-PICK-DISEASE; BETA-CYCLODEXTRINS; C1; BINDING; 2-HYDROXYPROPYL-BETA-CYCLODEXTRIN; INTERNALIZATION; ACCUMULATION; ENDOCYTOSIS; RECEPTOR	Niemann-Pick Type C is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by the cellular accumulation of cholesterol within endosomal and lysosomal compartments. 2-Hydroxypropyl-ss cyclodextrin (HP-ss- CD) containing polyrotaxanes represent an attractive approach for treating this disease due to their ability to circulate in the blood stream for longer periods of time as a prodrug form of HP-ss- CD. Once inside the cell, the macromolecular structure is thought to break down into the Pluronic precursor and the active cyclodextrin agent that promotes cholesterol mobilization from the aberrant accumulations within NPC-deficient cells. We now report that both cholesterol and decaarginine (R10) endcapped polyrotaxanes are able to remove cholesterol from NPC1 patient fibroblasts. R10 endcapped materials enter these cells and are localized within endosomes after 16 h. The cholesterol mobilization from endolysosomal compartments of NPC1 cells by the polyrotaxanes was directly related to their extent of endcapping and their threading efficiency. Incorporation of 4-sulfobutylether-ss cyclodextrin (SBE-ss- CD) significantly improved cholesterol mobilization due to the improved solubility of the compounds. Additionally, in our efforts to scale-up the synthesis for preclinical studies, we prepared a library of polyrotaxanes using a solid phase synthesis method. These compounds also led to significant cholesterol mobilization from the cells, however, cytotoxicity studies showed that they were substantially more toxic than those prepared by the solvent-assisted method, thus limiting the therapeutic utility of agents prepared by this expedited method. Our findings demonstrate that complete endcapping of the polyrotaxanes and improved solubility are important design features for delivering high copy numbers of therapeutic ss- CD to promote enhanced sterol clearance in human NPC1-deficient cells.

The rationale goes beyond standard documentation by capturing the developers' intent and all alternatives considered rather than only those selected. While the potential usefulness of this information is seldom questioned, it typically is not captured in practice. We feel that the key to motivating capture is to provide compelling uses and tool support integrated with the development environment. Here we describe the Software Engineering Using RATionale system which inferences over the rationale to evaluate decision alternatives and perform impact assessment when requirements, development criteria, and assumptions change.

Many convolution-based methods and Transformer-based methods have gained remarkable success in the field of CD with high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs) due to their powerful feature extraction capability and global information modeling capability, respectively. However, the diversity and complexity of HRSIs render CD methods constantly challenging, e.g., off-nadir angle imaging, seasonal turnover, and simultaneous changes in multiple feature types. Common convolution-based or Transformer-based encoding-decoding networks have a single way of data modeling and a low degree of feature fusion, resulting in poor applicability to different remote sensing data, poor recognition of different semantic targets, and limited accuracy. To improve the generalizability and detection accuracy of the network, we developed a composite higher-order attention network with multiple encoding paths named MCHA-Net. MCHA-Net has four encoding backbones, namely, the Siamese-learning path, Residual-learning path, and Transformer-learning path. Different encoding ways are equivalent to different thinking ends, and the integration can make the network have a stronger feature representation capability, forming a local-global-cross domain data modeling approach and making the network have powerful data sensing and mining capability. The decoding end aggregates the se-mantic information of each layer and integrates them into a unified linearized feature mapping module to achieve full modeling of the separability of information in the target domain. In addition, we propose a new higher-order attention mechanism to perform adaptive feature refinement for each layer of each encoding end, to guide the network in focusing on the targeted region and to guarantee the boundary integrity and internal compactness of the detection results. Moreover, we design a hierarchical network supervision schema that adds supervision signals at different feature abstraction levels to impose differentiated soft constraints on each layer of the network, ensuring high semantic consistency of features across layers and facilitating fast network fitting. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets (S2Looking, SVCD, and SYSU-CD) and one transfer application dataset (Google Dataset) show that MCHA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual interpretation and quantitative evaluation, and exhibits strong generalization and robustness against few-shot learning.

J	Li, SP; Zhang, XL; Webb, JD				Li, Songpo; Zhang, Xiaoli; Webb, Jeremy D.			3-D-Gaze-Based Robotic Grasping Through Mimicking Human Visuomotor Function for People With Motion Impairments	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						3D gaze tracking; assistive robot; robotic grasping; gaze control	GAZE TRACKING; EYE; RECOGNITION; STRATEGIES; INTERFACE; DESIGN	Objective: The goal of this paper is to achieve a novel 3-D-gaze-based human-robot-interaction modality, with which a user with motion impairment can intuitively express what tasks he/she wants the robot to do by directly looking at the object of interest in the real world. Toward this goal, we investigate 1) the technology to accurately sense where a person is looking in real environments and 2) the method to interpret the human gaze and convert it into an effective interaction modality. Looking at a specific object reflects what a person is thinking related to that object, and the gaze location contains essential information for object manipulation. Methods: A novel gaze vector method is developed to accurately estimate the 3-D coordinates of the object being looked at in real environments, and a novel interpretation framework that mimics human visuomotor functions is designed to increase the control capability of gaze in object grasping tasks. Results: High tracking accuracy was achieved using the gaze vector method. Participants successfully controlled a robotic arm for object grasping by directly looking at the target object. Conclusion: Human 3-D gaze can be effectively employed as an intuitive interaction modality for robotic object manipulation. Significance: It is the first time that 3-D gaze is utilized in a real environment to command a robot for a practical application. Three-dimensional gaze tracking is promising as an intuitive alternative for human-robot interaction especially for disabled and elderly people who cannot handle the conventional interaction modalities.

Adoption of agricultural conservation practices in the United States: Evidence from 35 years of quantitative literature	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						agricultural Best Management Practice (BMP); conservation programs; outreach; program design; social indicators; vote count	MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; MOTIVATES FARMERS; ATTITUDES; NUTRIENT; PLACE; TECHNOLOGIES; WILLINGNESS; DECISION; BEHAVIOR; TILLAGE	This is a comprehensive review of all published, quantitative studies focused on adoption of agricultural conservation practices in the United States between 1982 and 2017. This review finds that, taken as a whole, few independent variables have a consistent statistically significant relationship with adoption. Analyses showed that variables positively associated with adoption include the farmer self-identifying primarily as stewardship motivated or otherwise nonfinancially motivated, environmental attitudes, a positive attitude toward the particular program or practice, previous adoption of other conservation practices, seeking and using information, awareness of programs or practices, vulnerable land, greater farm size, higher levels of income and formal education, engaging in marketing arrangements, and positive yield impact expected. Some variables often thought to be important, such as land tenure, did not emerge as consistently important in this cross-study review Other variables, such as farmers' sense of place, training, presence of institutional conditions supporting adoption, and the role of collective decision making are not measured in enough studies to draw conclusions but potentially have a relationship with adoption decisions. Implications for how to promote conservation adoption and directions for future research are discussed. Because positive attitudes and awareness of conservation programs or practices are positive predictors of adoption, practitioners should share benefits of specific practices and programs and leverage existing practice adoption. Further work to explore relationships between conservation adoption and the role of farmer identity, nuances of land tenure, and the influence of structural factors is needed. Moreover, we suggest that future research should focus on the impact of different messages and avenues of reaching farmers in order to continue to inform conservation practices. Future research should consider both individual and institutional factors that facilitate and constrain adoption.	[Prokopy, L.

Recovery of subsampled dimensions and configurations derived from napping data by MFA and MDS	ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS			English	Article						Multivariate; Napping; MFA; INDSCAL; Subsampling	IDENTIFICATION; SIMILARITY; COLLECTION; ATTENTION; CONSUMERS; CHEESES; TASKS	Napping is a multivariate sensory method in which participants physically place stimuli on a large sheet of paper and orient them so that the distance between pairs represents a measure of dissimilarity. The two-dimensional nature of the task may be a limitation to the ability of this and similar methodologies to recover information about complex stimuli. In the first investigation, eight simulated three-dimensional stimuli were created with two different levels for each attribute. Simulated napping experiments had groups of participants attend to two of the dimensions with different probabilities. Multiple factor analysis (an analytical multivariate statistical procedure that can be thought of as a principle components analysis on the individuals) and MDS-INDSCAL (a variation on multidimensional scaling that finds a common configuration through reducing a stress measure associated with lack of fit) recovered full dimensionality from these data, although MFA had trouble when attention was the most unbalanced. In the second experiment, a human napping experiment was designed using custom three-dimensional stimuli: shapes with two levels each of size, color, and shape attributes. This experiment confirmed the results of Experiment 1, as both MDS-INDSCAL and MFA analyses again recovered the full dimensionality of the stimuli.

J	Finch, C				Finch, Caroline			A new framework for research leading to sports injury prevention	JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE IN SPORT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st World Congress of Sports Injury Prevention	JUL, 2005	Oslo, NORWAY			sports injury prevention; research framework	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT; EYEWEAR PROMOTION; SQUASH; SURVEILLANCE; MECHANISMS; PROGRAM; RISK	This paper proposes a new sports injury research framework, the Translating Research into Injury Prevention Practice framework, or TRIPP This model builds on the fact that only research that can, and will, be adopted by sports participants, their coaches and sporting bodies will prevent injuries. Future advances in sports injury prevention will only be achieved if research efforts are directed towards understanding the implementation context for injury prevention, as well as continuing to build the evidence base for their efficacy and effectiveness of interventions. There is no doubt that intervention research in the sporting field can be difficult and many challenges need to be overcome; however, that should not be put up as a barrier towards undertaking it. Over the next few years, sports injury researchers will need to think carefully about the "best" study designs and analysis tools to achieve this. All reported sports injury studies, of whatever design, should include information on key implementation factors such as player/club recruitment rates and other biases as well as the rate of uptake of the interventions being tested, including reasons for use/non-use. However, it will only be broad research endeavours that adopt the TRIPP six-staged approach that will. lead to real-world injury prevention gains. (c) 2006 Sports Medicine Australia.

Difficulties arising from the reluctance to answer questionnaires on the part of e-firms wary about trade and innovation secrets and their small number at the outset are thereby overcome. Survey data on demand-side obstacle factors in the form of perceived low e-shopping comparability, e-shopping inconvenience, e-transaction insecurity, and poor Internet privacy, together with orientation toward social interaction and low awareness on the part of consumers, translate into information on notionally matching supply-side hurdles. Regression analysis and hypothesis testing indicate statistical significance for the above hurdle factors in terms of impact on individual unwillingness to shop online. These results add to the inductive basis for future research into a general demand-supply theory of Internet B2C e-commerce and offer an empirically-grounded position against which the effects of later supply-side changes can be evaluated. Useful information also follows for engineer-managers seeking to compare marginal improvements in supply-side problems, particularly in the form of estimated substitution ratios.

However, different social influences in a classroom, such as academic prestige, friendship, and gender, may impact students' referencing behavior. Specifically, we investigated how various factors affect pupils' referencing of peer-generated questions during an online test-construction learning activity and perceptions. Three fifth-grade classes (n = 75, M-age = 11.08, SD age = 0.28) participated in a two-stage mixed methods research for 12 weeks. We found significant effects of friendship and inferred task-specific ability on online referencing behavior based on the multiple regression quadratic assignment procedures, simple regressions, and two-step hierarchical linear regressions. The survey data further revealed that students considered the content of their peers' questions most frequently among a mixture of other factors influencing online referencing decisions. The implications and suggestions for instruction, future studies, and system designs involving behavior connoting intent to endorse are provided to help create meaningful, reflective, and impartial online learning spaces.

This resource was built by mining existing literature and public databases and thereafter manual biocuration was performed. To enable integration of omic data from distinct platforms and species, a specific ontology was applied to tie together and harmonise multi-level omic studies based on gene and protein clusters (CIuSO) and mapping of orthologous genes (OMAP) across species. CAD continues to be a leading cause of death in the population worldwide, and it is generally thought to be an age-related disease. However, CAD incidence rates are now known to be highly influenced by environmental factors and interactions, in addition to genetic determinants. With the complexity of CAD aetiology, there is a difficulty in research studies to elucidate general elements compared to other cardiovascular diseases. Data from 92 studies, covering 13945 molecular entries (4353 unique molecules) is described, including data descriptors for experimental setup, study design, discovery-validation sample size and associated fold-changes of the differentially expressed molecular features (p-value<0.05). A dedicated interactive web interface, equipped with a multi-parametric search engine, data export and indexing menus are provided for a user-accessible browsing experience. The main aim of this work was the development of a data repository linking clinical information and molecular differential expression in several CVD-related traits from multi-omics studies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics).

Objective: To identify issues in selection of place for end-of-life care of cancer patients to realize their optimal survivorship. Design and Setting: Between September 2015 and January 2016, a questionnaire consisting of 33 items, including end-of-life care place preferences, was administered to cancer patients who attended three university hospitals in Japan. Results: A total of 971 questionnaires were collected (response rate, 88.4%). Fifty-eight percent of patients preferred to stay at home to receive end-of-life care. In contrast, more than 80% of patients did not know the details of healthcare services. The factors significantly associated with patients' choice for place of end-of-life care at home were male gender (odds ratio [OR]=1.43, p=0.030), living in a one-person household (OR=0.21, p<0.001), feeling close to friends (OR=0.94, p=0.049), thinking that the family is burdened (OR=0.55, p<0.001), thinking that pain is controllable at home (OR=1.39, p<0.001), and thinking that society should establish a system of home palliative care (OR=1.93, p<0.001). Conclusions: This study identified six factors influencing the selection of a place for end-of-life care. Most patients have a desire for a social system that allows end-of-life care at home where they can live with their family, but have anxiety about treatment to deal with symptom change, with concern about burden on their family. These issues should be addressed in the future.

Propionate is thought to lower lipogenesis, serum cholesterol levels, and carcinogenesis in other tissues. Steering microbial propionate production through diet could therefore be a potent strategy to increase health effects from microbial carbohydrate fermentation. The present review first discusses the two main propionate-production pathways and provides an extended gene-based list of microorganisms with the potential to produce propionate. Second, it evaluates the promising potential of arabinoxylan, polydextrose, and L-rhamnose to act as substrates to increase microbial propionate. Third, given the complexity of the gut microbiota, propionate production is approached from a microbial-ecological perspective that includes interaction processes such as cross-feeding mechanisms. Finally, it introduces the development of functional gene-based analytical tools to detect and characterize propionate-producing microorganisms in a complex community. The information in this review may be helpful for designing functional food strategies that aim to promote propionate-associated health benefits.

The SNARC Effect in Chinese Numerals: Do Visual Properties of Characters and Hand Signs Influence Number Processing?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MENTAL REPRESENTATION; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; SPATIAL INFORMATION; SPACE; MAGNITUDE; HABITS; ASSOCIATION; ACTIVATION; JUDGMENTS; DESIGNS	The SNARC effect refers to an association of numbers and spatial properties of responses that is commonly thought to be amodal and independent of stimulus notation. We tested for a horizontal SNARC effect using Arabic digits, simple-form Chinese characters and Chinese hand signs in participants from Mainland China. We found a horizontal SNARC effect in all notations. This is the first time that a horizontal SNARC effect has been demonstrated in Chinese characters and Chinese hand signs. We tested for the SNARC effect in two experiments (parity judgement and magnitude judgement). The parity judgement task yielded clear, consistent SNARC effects in all notations, whereas results were more mixed in magnitude judgement. Both Chinese characters and Chinese hand signs are represented non-symbolically for low numbers and symbolically for higher numbers, allowing us to contrast within the same notation the effects of heavily learned non-symbolic vs. symbolic representation on the processing of numbers. In addition to finding a horizontal SNARC effect, we also found a robust numerical distance effect in all notations. This is particularly interesting as it persisted when participants reported using purely visual features to solve the task, thereby suggesting that numbers were processed semantically even when the task could be solved without the semantic information.

Aim: To develop interactive teaching software functioning as a virtual clinic for the management of MPS II. Implementation and Results: The Hunter disease eClinic, a self-training, user-friendly educational software program, available at the Lysosomal Storage Research Group (http://www.lysosomalstorageresearch.ca), was developed using the Adobe Flash multimedia platform. It was designed to function both to provide a realistic, interactive virtual clinic and instantaneous access to supporting literature on Hunter disease. The Hunter disease eClinic consists of an eBook and an eClinic. The eClinic is the interactive virtual clinic component of the software. Within an environment resembling a real clinic, the trainee is instructed to perform a medical history, to examine the patient, and to order appropriate investigation. The program provides clinical data derived from the management of actual patients with Hunter disease. The eBook provides instantaneous, electronic access to a vast collection of reference information to provide detailed background clinical and basic science, including relevant biochemistry, physiology, and genetics. In the eClinic, the trainee is presented with quizzes designed to provide immediate feedback on both trainee effectiveness and efficiency. User feedback on the merits of the program was collected at several seminars and formal clinical rounds at several medical centres, primarily in Canada. In addition, online usage statistics were documented for a 2-year period. Feedback was consistently positive and confirmed the practical benefit of the program. The online English-language version is accessed daily by users from all over the world; a Japanese translation of the program is also available. Conclusions: The Hunter disease eClinic employs a CBT model providing the trainee with realistic clinical problems, coupled with comprehensive basic and clinical reference information by instantaneous access to an electronic textbook, the eBook. The program was rated highly by attendees at national and international presentations. It provides a potential model for use as an educational approach to other rare genetic diseases.

However, it has proved difficult to teach. Dragoon is an intelligent tutoring system intended to quickly and effectively teach this important skill. This paper describes Dragoon and an evaluation of it. The evaluation randomly assigned students in a university class to either Dragoon or baseline instruction that used Dragoon as an editor only. Among students who did use their systems, the tutored students scored reliably higher (p < .021, d = 1.06) on the post-test than the students who used only the conventional editor-based instruction.

Two major dimensions within ToM have been studied. The first is the type of inferred mental state, which can be cognitive or affective. The second comprises the types of processes involved according to their degree of complexity (first- and second-order false belief and advanced ToM). ToM acquisition is fundamental-a key component in the development of everyday human social interactions. ToM deficits have been reported in various neurodevelopmental disorders through various tools assessing disparate facets of social cognition. Nevertheless, Tunisian practitioners and researchers lack a linguistically and culturally appropriate psychometric tool for ToM assessment among school-aged children. ObjectiveTo assess the construct validity of a translated and adapted French ToM Battery for Arabic-speaking Tunisian school-aged children. MethodsThe focal ToM Battery was designed with neuropsychological and neurodevelopmental theory and composed of 10 subtests distributed evenly in three parts: Pre-conceptual, cognitive, and affective ToM. Translated and adapted to the Tunisian sociocultural context, this ToM battery was individually administered to 179 neurotypical Tunisian children (90 girls and 89 boys) aged 7-12 years. ResultsAfter controlling for the age effect, construct validity was empirically confirmed on two dimensions (cognitive and affective) via structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, demonstrating that this solution has a good fit. The results confirmed that the age affected differentially the performance obtained on ToM tasks based on the two components of the battery. ConclusionOur findings confirm that the Tunisian version of the ToM Battery has robust construct validity for the assessment of cognitive and affective ToM in Tunisian school-aged children; hence, it could be adopted in clinical and research settings.

Methylocella spp. were previously thought to be restricted to acidic soils such as peatlands, in which they may have a key role in methane oxidation. There is little information on the abundance and distribution of Methylocella spp. in the environment. New primers were designed, and a real-time quantitative PCR method was developed and validated targeting Methylocella mmoX (encoding the alpha-subunit of the soluble methane monooxygenase) that allowed the quantification of Methylocella spp. in environmental samples. We also developed and validated specific PCR assays, which target 16S rRNA genes of known Methylocella spp. These were used to investigate the distribution of Methylocella spp. in a variety of environmental samples. It was revealed that Methylocella species are widely distributed in nature and not restricted to acidic environments.

The main building blocks of ad hoc network applications are the routing protocols, mobility, and traffic models. Several studies, which use synthetic models, show that mobility and traffic have a significant effect on protocol performance. Synthetic models do not realistically reflect the environment where the ad hoc networks will be deployed. In addition, mobility and traffic tools are designed independently of each other, however real trace data challenge that assumption. Indeed, recent protocol performance evaluation using real testbeds show that performance evaluations under real testbeds and simulations that use synthetic models differ significantly. In this paper we consider jointly both real mobility and traffic for protocol performance evaluation. The contributions of this work are as follows: (1) demonstrates that real mobility and traffic are interconnected; (2) announces the design and implementation of WIT -Wireless Integrated Traffic-, which includes the design of a real traffic generator; (3) shows that under real mobility and integrated traffic the performance metrics need to be re-thought, thus we propose availability as a new ad hoc network protocol performance metric; and, finally, (4) evaluates protocol performance under synthetic and real mobility models with integrated traffic. We believe that the results of our work constitute a step forward toward benchmarking of ad hoc network performance evaluations.

Disabling barriers experienced by students with disabilities in postsecondary introductory physics	PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH			English	Article							ACCOMMODATIONS; SCIENCE; MODEL; DISCLOSURE; CHALLENGES; EDUCATION; FACULTY; ADULTS; ADHD	Educators and education researchers in postsecondary physics have rarely centered (i.e., intentionally directed attention to) the experiences of students with disabilities, leading to an instructional environment that is not designed to support students with disabilities. In this study, we interviewed five students who identified with the diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and were enrolled in introductory physics courses at a public four-year institution. We framed our investigation with a social relational perspective of disability, which posits that an individual's impairments (referred to as diagnosis characteristics in this paper) interact with social structures to result in disabling barriers (i.e., characteristics of social structures which prevent equal access for individuals with disabilities). We analyzed interview transcripts with interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). We found that the participating students discussed diagnosis characteristics including difficulties with focus, being prone to distractions, difficulties with keeping mental track of tasks and structures, and thinking often about abstract concepts. Diagnosis characteristics identified as challenges could result in negative selfperceptions, possibly as a result of internalized ableism. However, students also expressed that understanding their diagnosis led to benefits such as making more informed choices about their study strategies (e.g., using a planner or chunking their studying time). In alignment with our social relational perspective of disability, we found that course design could support or hinder participants' ability to use their preferred planning or studying strategies. We also found that students experienced increased barriers in their physics courses compared to other courses, specifically due to the increased time needed to process information and a lack of guidance for how to effectively study content for conceptual understanding. SCALE-UP courses introduced supports due to increased student autonomy but could also introduce barriers due to increased distractions. We present recommendations that instructors can implement to increase course supports. Researchers need to continue to center the experiences of students with disabilities in STEM courses so that researchers and practitioners can identify disciplinarily specific strategies to support student engagement and learning.

Surface microstructural controls on electrochemical hydrogen absorption at polycrystalline palladium	JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy; SECCM; Electron backscatter diffraction; EBSD; Scanning electrochemical probe microscopy; SEPM	CELL MICROSCOPY; GRAIN-BOUNDARIES; ACTIVE-SITES; EMBRITTLEMENT; DIFFUSION; ELECTRODES; PLATINUM; BEHAVIOR; EVOLUTION; METALS	The ease by which hydrogen is absorbed into a metal can be either advantageous or deleterious, depending on the material and application in question. For instance, in metals such as palladium (Pd), rapid absorption kinetics are seen as a beneficial property for hydrogen purification and storage applications, whereas the contrary is true for structural metals such as steel, which are susceptible to mechanical degradation in a process known as hydrogen embrittlement. It follows that understanding how the microstructure of metals (i.e., grains and grain boundaries) influences adsorption and absorption kinetics would be extremely powerful to rationally design materials (e.g., alloys) with either a high affinity for hydrogen or resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. To this end, scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is deployed herein to study surface structure-dependent electrochemical hydrogen absorption across the surface of flame annealed polycrystalline Pd in aqueous sulfuric acid (considered to be a model system for the study of hydrogen absorption). Correlating spatially-resolved cyclic voltammetric data from SECCM with co-located structural information from electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) reveals a clear relationship between the crystal orientation and the rate of hydrogen adsorption-absorption. Grains that are closest to the low-index orientations [i.e., the {100}, {101}, and {111} facets, face-centered cubic (fcc) system] facilitate the lowest rates of hydrogen absorption, whereas grains of high-index orientation (e.g., {411}) promote higher rates. Apparently enhanced kinetics are also seen at grain boundaries, which are thought to arise from physical deformation of the Pd surface adjacent to the boundary, resulting from the flame annealing and quenching process. As voltammetric measurements are made across a wide potential range, these studies also reveal palladium oxide formation and stripping to be surface structure-dependent processes, and further highlight the power of combined SECCM-EBSD for structure-activity measurements in electrochemical science.

Virtual reality (VR) is a capable means of activating phobic fear in patients. The representation of the patient's body (e.g., the right hand) in VR enhances immersion and increases presence, but its effect on phobic fear is still unknown. We analyzed the influence of the presentation of the participant's hand in VR on presence and fear responses in 32 women with spider phobia and 32 matched controls. Participants sat in front of a table with an acrylic glass container within reaching distance. During the experiment this setup was concealed by ahead-mounted display (HMD). The VR scenario presented via HMD showed the same setup, i.e., a table with an acrylic glass container. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups. In one group, fear responses were triggered by fear-relevant visual input in VR (virtual spider in the virtual acrylic glass container), while information about a real but unseen neutral control animal (living snake in the acrylic glass container) was given. The second group received fear-relevant information of the real but unseen situation (living spider in the acrylic glass container), but visual input was kept neutral VR (virtual snake in the virtual acrylic glass container). Participants were instructed to touch the acrylic glass container with their right hand in 20 consecutive trials. Visibility of the hand was varied randomly in a within-subjects design. We found for all participants that visibility of the participant's hand increased presence independently of the fear trigger. However, in patients, the influence of the virtual hand on fear depended on the fear trigger. When fear was triggered perceptually, i.e., by a virtual spider, the virtual hand increased fear. When fear was triggered by information about a real spider, the virtual hand had no effect on fear. Our results shed light on the significance of different fear triggers (visual, conceptual) in interaction with body representations.

JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ANESTHESIA			English	Article						remifentanil; outpatients; outcomes; recovery; functional status	AMBULATORY SURGERY; OUTPATIENT SURGERY; AFTER-DISCHARGE; PHARMACOKINETICS; PHARMACODYNAMICS; ALFENTANIL; RECOVERY	Study Objectives: To compare patients' functional ability in the 24-hour postoperative period following a remifentanil compared to a hypnotic-fentanyl-treated anesthesia regimen using a 24-Hour Functional Ability Questionnaire. Design: Prospective, 1:1 single-blind, randomized, controlled effectiveness study. Setting: Multicenter study including 156 hospitals and ambulatory surgery facilities. Patients: 2438 patients (1496 outpatients and 942 inpatients) 18 years of age or older, scheduled for elective surgeries under general endotracheal anesthesia, with an expected duration of unconsciousness of greater than or equal to 30 minutes. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive either intravenous remifentanil (0.5 mug/kg/min for induction and intubation; with the infusion rate, decreased to 0.25 mug/kg/min after intubation) or fentanyl (administered according to anesthesiologists' usual Practice) as the opioid during surgery. Concomitant hypnotic drugs were propofol and/or isoflurane (with or without nitrous oxide) titrated according to protocol. Transition analgesia with either morphine or fentanyl was given in the remifentanil patients and at the discretion of the anesthesiologists in the fentanyl patients. Measurements: A validated set Of measurements of functional ability, rather than more traditional clinical psychological methods, to compare the recovery of patients from remifentanil- and fentanyl-treated anesthetic regimens up to 24 hours after surgery. Main Results: Remifentanil was statistically superior to fentanyl for the four functional assessments evaluated: walking without dizziness, thinking clearly, concentration, and communicating effectively. These differences reflect events occurring within the first 24 hours after anesthesia and surgery. Conclusions: A remifentanil-treated anesthetic demonstrated earlier return to some functions than a fentanyl-treated technique. Although functional assessment is a field that is still in its infancy, a questionnaire to assess functional ability during the 24 hours after anesthesia may provide more Practical information about anesthetic recovery than previously used, traditional psychomotor evaluations.

Design Qualitative analysis of compulsory post-audit group report data collection forms and individual practitioners' post-audit evaluation forms. Subjects Information was collected from 175 general dental practitioners in the North West of England who participated in the audit. Method The general dental practitioners were divided into groups of 8-10 to undertake the audit. Information from compulsory post-audit group reports was transcribed and analysed. The information was categorised into a number of areas including changes in practice, patients' expectations, training and quality of service. On completion of the audit individual practitioners were asked to complete an evaluation form on the audit process. Results 141 (80.5%) individual evaluation forms were returned. Over 90% of GDPs felt that the audit process was easily understood and the majority of the practitioners thought the audit was worthwhile. Approximately 69% of participants felt that the audit had helped to change their antibiotic prescribing practices. Analysis of the post-audit group report data collection forms revealed more than 100 statements. The most common areas were changes required in practice, patients' expectations, increased training and quality of service. Conclusion The collaborative clinical audit project was seen to be a worthwhile learning experience by the participating general dental practitioners. The audit encouraged GDPs to change their antibiotic prescribing practices and thereby improve patient care. GDPs also highlighted the need for continuing education in the prescribing of antibiotics.

The advent of light-intensity autocorrelation techniques in the 1950s, first developed to study the size of stars, changed little in this perception, until true single-photon correlation spectroscopy from trapped ions was proven to be possible in the late 1970s: Photons from a single quantum emitter tend to arrive in bunches, but each light quantum is spaced apart in time-it is antibunched. Initially considered only as the workhorse of atomic quantum optics, over the past two decades, photon correlation techniques have become a standard in fields as diverse as quantum-information processing, biological imaging, polymer physics, and materials science, in general. The technique is particularly useful for probing materials that are specifically designed to emit or absorb light in optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes, solar cells, or lasers. The central question in such studies is how large a mesoscopic piece of material can become and still behave as an atom-like source of single photons. What interactions may arise between multiple excitations within a material, and what sort of dark states may give rise to intermittency in the stream of photons? We review the many different classes of optoelectronic materials for which photon-correlation spectroscopy has proven to offer useful insight into excited-state dynamics, ranging from molecular, over semiconductor to metallic nanostructures. The technique is particularly suited to probing mesoscopic aggregates of organic semiconductors since each single molecule acts as a quantum emitter itself.& nbsp;(C)2021 Author(s).

J	Haruvy, E; Katok, E; Pavlov, V				Haruvy, Ernan; Katok, Elena; Pavlov, Valery			Bargaining Process and Channel Efficiency	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						behavioral operations; supply chain contracts; experimental economics; bargaining	BOUNDEDLY RATIONAL CUSTOMERS; CONTRACTS; INVENTORY; PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION; FAIRNESS; MARKET	The behavioral literature has demonstrated that the format of supply chain contracts matters even when theoretically it should not and that contracts that in theory coordinate channels fail to do so in laboratory experiments. The existing body of experimental evidence uses an ultimatum bargaining protocol to test analytical models, but there is no reason to think that bargaining in supply chains is in the form of ultimatum offers. We investigate the effect of bargaining on contract performance by extending the bargaining protocol to allow the manufacturer to make concessions. We test coordinating contract with bargaining in the laboratory by comparing wholesale price and the two-part tariff contracts using two different bargaining protocols. We then develop and estimate a statistical model of behavior with bargaining and find that this model organizes our data well. Our main finding is that the contracts that we study are more efficient when participants are allowed to make concessions. The additional channel efficiency is owing to more efficient offers made by manufacturers. The higher channel efficiency primarily benefits the retailer-the weaker party. Our main contribution is the observation that, when testing analytical models of contracts in the laboratory, the way that the bargaining process is implemented, such as the ability to make concessions, has a critical effect on conclusions.

J	Lu, Y; Song, JJ; Wang, PX; Xu, TH				Lu, Yu; Song, Jingjing; Wang, Pingxin; Xu, Taihua			Label-specific guidance for efficiently searching reduct	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Accelerator; attribute reduction; label-specific guidance; rough set	INCREMENTAL ATTRIBUTE REDUCTION; FEATURE-SELECTION; DISCERNIBILITY MATRIX; KNOWLEDGE REDUCTION; ACCELERATOR; APPROXIMATION; ALGORITHM; ENTROPY	In the era of big data for exploring attribute reduction/rough set-based feature selection related problems, to design efficient strategies for deriving reducts and then reduce the dimensions of data, two fundamental perspectives of Granular Computing may be taken into account: breaking up the whole into pieces and gathering parts into a whole. From this point of view, a novel strategy named label-specific guidance is introduced into the process of searching reduct. Given a formal description of attribute reduction, by considering the corresponding constraint, we divide it into several label-specific based constraints. Consequently, a sequence of these label-specific based constraints can be obtained, it follows that the reduct related to the previous label-specific based constraint may have guidance on the computation of that related to the subsequent label-specific based constraint. The thinking of this label-specific guidance runs through the whole process of searching reduct until the reduct over the whole universe is derived. Compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms over 20 data sets, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed acceleration strategy can not only significantly accelerate the process of searching reduct but also offer justifiable performance in the task of classification. This study suggests a new trend concerning the problem of quickly deriving reduct.

Testing and Refining the Ethical Framework for the Use of Horses in Sport	ANIMALS			English	Article						ethical framework; horse welfare; decision making; equestrian sports	SQUAMOUS GASTRIC DISEASE; PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTANCE; BLOOMS TAXONOMY; ANIMAL-WELFARE; EXERCISE; HEALTH; PERFORMANCE; PREVALENCE; CONSENSUS; SCIENCE	In 2021, in response to an acknowledged need for universal, consistent ethics to guide decision making in the horse sport sector, Campbell published a theoretical ethical framework for the use of horses in competitive sport. The research reported here tested the applied usefulness of that theoretical ethical framework through stakeholder engagement in a three-round modified Delphi study and refined it to develop a practical decision-making tool which can be applied consistently across multiple equestrian disciplines. Stakeholders from a broad range of equestrian competitive disciplines participated in the research. Participants were required to apply the ethical framework to a pre-determined ethical dilemma, individually (Rounds 1 and 2) and within a group (Round 3), and at the end of each round to complete a questionnaire designed to gauge opinion and user experience. At the completion of each round of testing, the theoretical framework was refined based on stakeholder feedback. Results showed that participants perceived use ability and application of the framework to generally increase with each round. Qualitative content analysis identified key concepts, including cognition (e.g., broadens/deepens thinking) and application (e.g., considers multiple angles from a variety of information sources, needs to be a short/simple process). Results suggested that the refined framework is beneficial for group decision making across a wide variety of ethical issues and equestrian competitive disciplines. The framework thus has the potential to improve equine welfare through facilitating consistent ethical decision making in which the interests of the horse are prioritized.

J	Wang, XR; Wang, WL; Zhang, WL				Wang, Xingru; Wang, Weili; Zhang, Weiliang			Digital Dissemination of Scene Art in Changbai Mountain Area of Visual Sensor Images	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article							MIXED FOREST; SOIL	With the booming development of the tourism industry, how to bring good benefits to the tourist attractions has become a topic worth pondering. In today's Internet age, digital communication has become a mainstream way of disseminating art and culture in tourist attractions. This paper takes Changbai Mountain as the research object and realizes the digital dissemination of scene art in Changbai Mountain based on visual sensor image technology. Digital communication not only changes the way of information dissemination but also profoundly affects people's life, work, and entertainment, changing the way people receive information and the way of thinking, and people have higher requirements for information. Therefore, on the one hand, the communication of Changbai Mountain tourism culture should develop with the development of the times. On the other hand, it should evolve with the evolution of information and constantly change its own form of expression and dissemination to meet the needs of the audience. Finally, the effectiveness of digital dissemination of scene art in Changbai Mountains is reflected through the tourism statistics. The results show that the total tourism revenue of Changbai Mountain in 2019 is the largest, which is 5.61 billion yuan.

The influence of the agency perspective on temporary agency workers	EMPLOYEE RELATIONS			English	Article						Agency problems; Agency theory; Agency cost; Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation; Temporary agency workers	HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONAL OUTCOMES; PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT; EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS; SELF-DETERMINATION; JOB QUALITY; PERFORMANCE; INCENTIVES; BEHAVIOR; SATISFACTION	Purpose-Based on agency perspective on temporary agency workers, the purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between firms' agency problems and agency cost on agency workers; moreover, intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation are considered in seeking to understand howtheymoderate this relationship. Design/methodology/approach -Using the Hsinchu Science Park directory of corporate affiliations as a sample frame, the authors adopted a paired questionnaire which included two parts in order to consider the possible problem of common method variances. The first part is completed by the manager of the firms and the second part is completed by his/her temporary agency workers. Finally, 94 firms completed questionnaires, providing a total sample of 94 R& D managers and 458 temporary agency workers. The rate of participation was 31.65 percent. Findings -Using a questionnaire survey of 94 high-tech firms, from which a total of 94 R& D managers and 458 temporary agency workers participated, the results show that firms' agency problems have a positive influence on the agency cost of monitoring temporary agency workers. In addition, while this relationship is negatively moderated by extrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation has a non-significant moderating effect. Originality/value -The managers of firms should consider not only the short-term flexibility of employing temporary agency workers, but also the long-term cultivation of promoting great agency workers. This could maximize the efficiency of the interaction between intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. Of course, the firms should think about how to reduce the agency problems created by goal conflict, information asymmetry and risk sharing with temporary agency workers, because this could also provide a chance for the firms to decrease agency costs spent on monitoring.

J	KASHIHARA, A; MATSUMURA, K; HIRASHIMA, T; TOYODA, J				KASHIHARA, A; MATSUMURA, K; HIRASHIMA, T; TOYODA, J			LOAD-ORIENTED TUTORING TO ENHANCE STUDENTS EXPLANATION UNDERSTANDING - AN EXPLANATION PLANNER AND A SELF-EXPLANATION ENVIRONMENT	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						LOAD-ORIENTED TUTORING; LOAD CONTROL; EXPLANATION; SELF-EXPLANATION; PLANNING; LEARNING MOTIVATION; IMPASSE-DRIVEN LEARNING		This paper discusses the design of an ITS to realize a load-oriented tutoring to enhance the student's explanation understanding. In the explanation understanding, it is to be hoped that a student not only memorizes the new information from an explanation, but also relates the acquired information with his/her own knowledge to recognize what it means. This relating process can be viewed as the one in which the student structures his/her knowledge with the explanation. In our ITS, we regard the knowledge-structuring activities as the explanation understanding. In this paper, we propose an explanation, called a load-oriented explanation, with the intention of applying a load to the student's knowledge-structuring activities purposefully. If the proper load is applied, the explanation can induce the student to think by himself/herself. Therefore he/she will have a chance of gaining the deeper understanding. The important point toward the load-oriented explanation generation is to control the load heaviness appropriately, which a student will bear in understanding the explanation. This requires to estimate how an explanation promotes the understanding activities and how much the load is applied to the activities. In order to provide ITS with the estimation, we have built an Explanation Effect Model, EEM for short. Our ITS consists of an explanation planner and a self-explanation environment. The planner generates the load-oriented explanation based on EEM. The system also makes a student explain the explanation understanding process to himself/herself. Such self-explanation is useful to let the student be conscious of the necessity of structuring his/her knowledge with the explanation. The self-explanation environment supports the student's self-explanation. Furthermore, if the student reaches an impasse in self-explaining, the planner can generate the supporting explanation for the impasse.

Peer instruction is a cooperative learning technique that promotes critical thinking, problem solving, and decision-making skills. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that peer instruction enhances meaningful learning or transfer, defined as the student's ability to solve novel problems or the ability to extend what has been learned in one context to new contexts. To test this hypothesis, our undergraduate exercise physiology class of 38 students was randomly divided into two groups: group A (n = 19) and group B (n = 19). A randomized crossover design in which students either answered questions individually or during peer instruction was used to control for time and order effects. The first factor that influences meaningful learning is the degree of mastery of the original material. Importantly, peer instruction significantly enhanced mastery of the original material. Furthermore, the student's ability to solve novel problems was significantly enhanced following peer instruction. Thus pausing two to three times during a 50-min class to allow peer instruction enhanced the mastery of the original material and enhanced meaningful learning, i.e., the student's ability to solve novel problems.

In this paper, we summarize our findings and our thinking process as we developed our own program. Breast cancer incidence is increasing worldwide. Even though there are known risk factors for breast cancer development, approximately 60% of patients with breast cancer have no known risk factor, although this situation will probably change with further research, especially in genetics. For patients with risk factors based on personal or family history, different models are available for assessing and quantifying risk. Assignment of risk levels permits tailored screening and risk reduction strategies. Potential benefits of specialized programs for women with high breast cancer risk include more cost-effective interventions as a result of patient stratification on the basis of risk; generation of valuable data to advance science; and differentiation of breast programs from other breast cancer units, which can result in increased revenue that can be directed to further improvements in patient care. Guidelines for care of patients at high risk for breast cancer are available from various groups. However, running a high-risk breast program involves much more than applying a guideline. Each high-risk program needs to be designed by its institution with consideration of local resources and country legislation, especially related to genetic issues. Development of a successful high-risk program includes identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats; developing a promotion plan; choosing a risk assessment tool; defining "high risk"; and planning screening and risk reduction strategies for the specific population served by the program. The information in this article may be useful for other institutions considering creation of programs for patients with high breast cancer risk.

The impact of secure messaging on workflow in primary care: Results of a multiple-case, multiple-method study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Patient portal; Secure messaging; Workflow; Multiple case study; Mixed methods	PATIENT-PROVIDER COMMUNICATION; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PHYSICIAN E-MAIL; USER SATISFACTION; SYSTEM; ASSOCIATION; SERVICES	Introduction: Secure messaging is a relatively new addition to health information technology (IT). Several studies have examined the impact of secure messaging on (clinical) outcomes but very few studies have examined the impact on workflow in primary care clinics. In this study we examined the impact of secure messaging on workflow of clinicians, staff and patients. Methods: We used a multiple case study design with multiple data collections methods (observation, interviews and survey). Results: Results show that secure messaging has the potential to improve communication and information flow and the organization of work in primary care clinics, partly due to the possibility of asynchronous communication. However, secure messaging can also have a negative effect on communication and increase workload, especially if patients send messages that are not appropriate for the secure messaging medium (for example, messages that are too long, complex, ambiguous, or inappropriate). Results show that clinicians are ambivalent about secure messaging. Secure messaging can add to their workload, especially if there is high message volume, and currently they are not compensated for these activities. Staff is -especially compared to clinicians- relatively positive about secure messaging and patients are overall very satisfied with secure messaging. Finally, clinicians, staff and patients think that secure messaging can have a positive effect on quality of care and patient safety. Conclusion: Secure messaging is a tool that has the potential to improve communication and information flow. However, the potential of secure messaging to improve workflow is dependent on the way it is implemented and used. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Hoonakker, Peter L.

This study aimed (1) to identify factors of conversation success and (2) to explore the importance of these factors in one-to-one versus group conversations. Design Group concept mapping method was applied. Participants responded to two brainstorming prompts ("What does 'successful conversation' look like?" and "Think about a successful conversation you have taken part in. What aspects of that conversation contributed to its success?"). The resulting statements were sorted into related clusters and rated in importance for one-to-one and group conversation.

Results Seven clusters were identified: (1) Being able to listen easily; (2) Being spoken to in a helpful way; (3) Being engaged and accepted; (4) Sharing information as desired; (5) Perceiving flowing and balanced interaction; (6) Feeling positive emotions; (7) Not having to engage coping mechanisms. Three clusters (1, 2, and 4) were more important in group than in one-to-one conversation. There were no differences by hearing group. Conclusions These findings emphasise that conversation success is a multifaceted concept.

How to control the fine-tuning progress to get the desired properties is still a challenging problem. Our key observation is that the visual features of the pre-trained model have rich information and can be explored during the training process. A natural thought is to employ these features and design a control strategy to improve the performance of the transfer learning process. In this paper, a procedural learning framework using the learned low-rank component of the visual features both in the pre-trained model and the training process is proposed to improve the accuracy and generalizability of the CNN. In this framework, we presented an approach to yield independent visualization features (IVFs). We found via robust independent component analysis that the low-rank components of IVFs provided robust features for our framework. Then, we design a Wasserstein regularization to control the transportation of the distribution of IVFs from a pre-trained model to a final model via the Wasserstein distance. The experiments on the Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 datasets via a VGG-style CNN model showed that our method effectively improves the classification results and convergence speed. The basic idea is that exploring visual features can also potentially inspire other topics, such as image detection and reinforcement learning.

Using a population-based sample, we determined which children were more likely to be diagnosed prenatally, and whether early diagnosis was associated with maternal satisfaction and treatment outcomes. Design: Interviews were completed with 235 (49% of eligible) mothers of children ages 2 to 7 with orofacial clefts initially enrolled in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study from the Arkansas, Iowa, and New York sites. Maternal satisfaction with information, support, and treatment outcomes was compared between women who received a prenatal diagnosis and those who did not. Results: Of 235 infants with clefts, 46 (19.6%) were identified prenatally. One third of mothers were somewhat or not satisfied with information provided by medical staff. Satisfaction did not vary by timing of the diagnosis. Infants diagnosed prenatally were no more likely to have received care provided by a recognized multidisciplinary cleft team (76%) than were infants diagnosed at birth (78%). Speech problems and facial appearance as rated by the mother did not vary by timing of the diagnosis. Conclusions: Timing of the cleft diagnosis did not alter maternal satisfaction with information, whether care was provided by a designated cleft team, or maternal perception of facial appearance or speech. Further research should determine whether prenatal diagnoses alter maternal anxiety or influence postnatal morbidity.	[Robbins, James M.; Hobbs, Charlotte A.; Reading, J.

Rough fuzzy sets (RFS) are constructed to handle fuzzy concepts by extending the classical rough sets. In three-way decision with rough fuzzy sets (3WDRFS), current works are mainly concerned with calculating the thresholds according to the given risk parameters to make 3WD with minimum cost. However, in real applications, the risk parameters are given in a subjective way based on expert experience. As a result, the risk parameters may be difficult to accurately obtain in 3WDRFS. To solve this problem, uncertainty measure is introduced into 3WDRFS, which provides a new perspective for 3WD theory. First, the fuzziness-based uncertainty for the average-step-fuzzy sets of RFS is analyzed. Then, based on the average-step-fuzzy sets, a 3WDRFS is proposed with the idea of minimizing the uncertainty loss. Furthermore, the sequential three-way decision of RFS (S3WDRFS) with adaptive thresholds from the perspective of fuzziness is presented. The relevant experiments suggest that the objective function designed in the proposed 3WDRFS is effective and reasonable. Moreover, 3WDRFS based on uncertainty loss has better performance than 0.5-approximation model.

The structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was used to test the research framework on a sample of 441 responses from Brazilian firms.FindingsThe results suggest that SK and ITC facilitate BPP, resulting in IAM. The findings also suggested differences in path coefficients in the SK and ITC of the business value generation process framework under environmental turbulence (ET). Finally, a strong SK of ITC is especially important in enabling BPP and IAM in large firms. Another case of most manufacturing and service firms demonstrated that both SK and ITC are essential to impacting IAM through BPP mediation.Practical implicationsThe findings provide insight into how professionals can think and plan carefully to align SK and ITC for achieving balanced innovation and improving BPP in the dynamic business environment.Originality/valueThe study establishes a relationship between SK, ITC, BPP and IAM. The study developed novel constructs of SK and ITC and tested them, which gives new insight and links among the constructs.

To address this question, we employ an experimental design that explores reactions to political candidates with a southern accent and a regionally neutral accent. We focus on perceptions of three general categories of candidate characteristics: candidate traits, candidate affect, and candidate issue positions. Overall, we discover that candidates with a southern accent are viewed more negatively, and they are thought to hold more conservative policy positions, than candidates with no discernible accent. Our findings suggest that the southern accent provides a heuristic that affects how voters perceive candidates.	[Amira, Karyn; Knotts, H.

In particular we studied the role of motivation. Design A realist review of the literature. Data sources EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and PEDRO. Eligibility criteria Publications reporting exercise based interventions for people with cognitive impairment, including dementia, living in the community. Data extraction and synthesis A 'rough programme theory' (a preliminary model of how an intervention works) was developed, tested against findings from the published literature and refined. Data were collected according to elements of the programme theory and not isolated to outcomes. Motivation emerged as a key element, and was prioritised for further study. Results An individual will access mechanisms to support participation when they think that exercise will be beneficial to them. Supportive mechanisms include having a 'gate-keeper', such as a carer or therapist, who shares responsibility for the perception of exercise as beneficial. Lack of access to support decreases adherence and participation in exercise. Motivational mechanisms were particularly relevant for older adults with mild-to-moderate dementia, where the exercise intervention was multicomponent, in a preferred setting, at the correct intensity and level of progression, correctly supported and considered, and flexibly delivered. Conclusion Motivation is a key element enabling participation in exercise-based interventions for people with cognitive impairment. Many of the mechanisms identified in this review have parallels in motivational theory. Clinically relevant recommendations were derived and will be used to further develop and test a motivationally considered exercise-based falls intervention for people with mild dementia.

J	Müggenburg, J; Pias, C				Mueggenburg, Jan; Pias, Claus			Witless slaves or lively artifacts? A debate of the 1960s	ARQ-ARCHITECTURAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY			English	Article								During late modernism, the promise of, not only vaguely, but also precisely predicting the future had acquired enormous prestige. When evoked, this predictive project lent power, legitimacy, and a cohesive identity to endeavours in almost any realm of society and culture including the discipline of architecture. In particular, in cybernetics, seen as a means of regulating and controlling complex systems, these optimistic ideas of 'mastering the big picture' flourished. Under the heading of 'Cybernetics: Circular Casual, and Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social Systems', the umbrella organisation Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation hosted ten conferences on this very topic between 1946 and 1951. 1 These events, known as the Macy Conferences, provided a forum for the collation and presentation of existing research, and in retrospect can be seen to have been the most important 'get-together' of their kind, judged in relation to subsequent crucial findings in the history of science after the Cold War. Based upon the theoretical framework of the terms of 'information', 'feedback', and 'analog/digital', they searched for that single universal theory of regulation and control - which they claimed might be applied to any species, machine, economic or psychological process, aesthetic or sociological phenomenon. As a consequence, cybernetics transformed into a tool to describe and explain methodologies not only in its own core knowledge/research area, but became seen as a subject capable of giving answers to societal questions of any kind. In doing so, cybernetics linked new scientific-technical methods with all issues of social relevance. In recent years, German media theory and related branches of media studies have undertaken documentation of and profound research into, the history and significance of cybernetics. 2 In contrast, architectural science has only sporadically addressed the consequences that might ensue from the implementation of this technical thinking in the planning, drafting, and final implementation of architecture. 3 In the 1950s and 1960s cybernetics was warmly, even ecstatically embraced and productively employed by a number of architects. For example, Nicholas Negroponte and Yona Friedman dealt with the question of how cybernetics and information theory could open up new options for the use of creative tools for future societies. In their drafts and concepts, Negroponte and Friedman already showcased the first outlines of contemporary globally-used digital networks and communication structures, which, in the long run, were to fundamentally alter social and spatial realities. Whereas Negroponte investigated human-machine-interaction at Boston-MITin order to, so to speak, amplify the creative component in the design process, the Stuttgart-based architectural theorist Manfred Kiemle, around the group of Max Bense, rather applied quantitative aesthetics to it - paying more attention to the decision-making process. (5)However, it was Frei Otto who in those new and operative spaces of technical systems, procedures, and processes detected the possibility of overcoming conventional boundaries between object and subject, nature and culture in order to, based upon his findings, develop a genuinely new and synthesising effect on performative architecture. In their paper, Jan Muggenburg and Claus Pias throw the utopian idea of cybernetics and its mythologizing power into question. They discuss the reciprocal influences between natural sciences, technical sciences, and the humanities in times of technophilia and euphoric attitudes towards planning processes. Their arguments include an interrogation of the fundamental ideological premises on which this infinite optimism towards forthcoming progress was based. The paper searches for those key actors of paramount importance who sought to implement their scholarly work as an agent of progress in politics, society, culture, and the arts, while analysing the consequences of those promises for a new kind of knowledge/knowledge culture on traditional cultural values and orders. Thus, Muggenburg's and Pias's approach paves the way for contextualising current debates about information technology-based impacts on architecture. It can be regarded as another important contribution to the debate on how the methodological appeal of cybernetics has had a lasting and continuing effect on architecture, and on how this abstract world of modelling, made up of symbolic machines, still exerts a lingering effect on the discipline of design formerly determined by intuitive drafts and the idea of pure material reification alone.

New insights in the photochromic <i>spiro</i>-dihydroindolizine/betaine-system	PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							PHOTOINDUCED ELECTRON-TRANSFER; STATE PROPERTIES; ENERGY; MECHANISM; UNITS	We have revisited the photochromic spiro-dihydroindolizine/betaine (DHI/B) system applying state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with stationary and time-resolved absorption measurements. DHI/B-systems are becoming increasingly important as potential molecular machines, molecular switches, and photoswitchable electron-acceptors. The knowledge of the exact mechanisms of ring opening and closure, as well as of the geometries of DHI and betaine can provide critical information that will enable the design of better molecular machines and optical switches. The. first surprising result concerns the electronic structure of the betaines, which is quite different than commonly assumed. The photochemical ring opening of DHI's to betaines is a conrotatory 1,5 electrocyclic reaction, whereas the thermal ring-closing occurs in the disrotatory mode. According to our results, the electrocyclic back reaction of the betaines to the DHI is NOT rate determining, as previously thought, but instead the kinetics are dictated by the cis-trans-isomerization of the betaine.

Are Leg Muscle, Tendon and Functional Characteristics Associated with Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome? A Systematic Review	SPORTS MEDICINE-OPEN			English	Review						Shin splints; Injury prevention; Injury rehabilitation; Leg girth	RISK-FACTORS; INJURIES; RUNNERS; SCINTIGRAPHY	Background Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) is a common overuse injury that lacks effective evidence-based treatment options. Reduced leg girth has been associated with MTSS development because it is hypothesised to impair the ability of the leg to modulate tibial loading generated during foot-ground contact. Measuring total leg girth, however, does not provide specific information about the structural composition or functional capacity of individual leg muscles. Consequently, uncertainty remains as to which specific muscles are compromised and contribute to MTSS development. Therefore, this paper aimed to systematically review the body of literature pertaining to how the structure and function of the leg muscles are thought to be associated with MTSS injury. Methods The review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). Medline, PubMed, SCOPUS, SPORTDiscus with Full-texts and Web of Science were searched until March 2021 to identify articles in which lower limb muscle structural or functional variables associated with MTSS injury were investigated. Results Seventeen studies, which were predominately case-control in design and captured data from 332 individuals with MTSS symptoms and 694 control participants, were deemed appropriate for review. The average Downs and Black Quality Assessment score was 71.7 +/- 16.4%, with these articles focussing on leg girth, tendon abnormalities, muscle strength and endurance, shear modulus and neuromuscular control. Of the risk factors assessed in the 17 studies, decreased lean leg girth and higher peak soleus muscle activity during propulsion were most strongly correlated with MTSS development. Individuals with MTSS also displayed deficits in ankle plantar flexor endurance, greater isokinetic concentric eversion strength, increased muscle shear modulus and altered neuromuscular recruitment strategies compared to asymptomatic controls. Conclusions Future prospective studies are required to confirm whether decreased lean leg girth and higher peak soleus muscle activity during propulsion are associated with MTSS development and to elucidate whether these structural and functional differences in the leg muscles between MTSS symptomatic and asymptomatic controls are a cause or effect of MTSS.

Among the underserved groups disproportionately affected by the digital divide are women who are transitioning from incarceration and seeking to reenter the workforce outside the carceral system (women-in-transition). Women-in-transition rarely have been exposed to sound technology education, as they have generally been isolated from the digital environment while in incarceration. Furthermore, while women have become the fastest-growing segment of the incarcerated population in the United States in recent decades, prison education and reentry programs are still not well adjusted for them. Most programs are mainly designed for the dominant male population. Consequently, womenin-transition face significant post-incarceration challenges in accessing and using relevant digital technologies and thus have added difficulties in entering or reentering the workforce. Against this backdrop, our multi-disciplinary research team has conducted empirical research as part of technology education offered to women-in-transition in the Midwest. In this article, we report results from our interviews with 75 womenin-transition in the Midwest that were conducted to develop a tailored technology education program for the women. More than half of the participants in our study are women of color and face precarious housing and financial situations. Then, we discuss principles that we adopted in developing our education program for the marginalized women and participants' feedback on the program. Our team launched in-person sessions with women-in-reentry at public libraries in February 2020 and had to move the sessions online in March due to COVID-19. Our research-informed educational program is designed primarily to support the women in enhancing their knowledge and comfort with technology and nurturing computational thinking. Our study shows that low self-efficacy and mental health challenges, as well as lack of resources for technology access and use, are some of the major issues that need to be addressed in supporting technology learning among women-in-transition. This research offers scholarly and practical implications for computing education for women-in-transition and other marginalized populations.

A User Study to Compare Four Uncertainty Visualization Methods for 1D and 2D Datasets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE Information Visualization Conference/IEEE Visualization Conference	OCT 11, 2009	Atlantic City, NJ	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE vgtc, Natl Informat Assurance Res Lab, Kitware, NVAC, NVIDIA, VisMaster, IBM Res, HP, Microsoft Res, Natl Lib Med, NSI, CYVIZ, Appl Vis Secure Decis, SCI, Morgan & Claypool Publ, Palgrave Macmillan, A K Peters Ltd		User study; uncertainty visualization		Many techniques have been proposed to show uncertainty in data visualizations. However, very little is known about their effectiveness in conveying meaningful information. In this paper, we present a user study that evaluates the perception of uncertainty amongst four of the most commonly used techniques for visualizing uncertainty in one-dimensional and two-dimensional data. The techniques evaluated are traditional errorbars, scaled size of glyphs, color-mapping on glyphs, and color-mapping of uncertainty on the data surface. The study uses generated data that was designed to represent the systematic and random uncertainty components. Twenty-seven users performed two types of search tasks and two types of counting tasks on 1 D and 2D datasets. The search tasks involved finding data points that were least or most uncertain. The counting tasks involved counting data features or uncertainty features. A 4x4 full-factorial ANOVA indicated a significant interaction between the techniques used and the type of tasks assigned for both datasets indicating that differences in performance between the four techniques depended on the type of task performed. Several one-way ANOVAs were computed to explore the simple main effects. Bonferronni's correction was used to control for the family-wise error rate for alpha-inflation. Although we did not find a consistent order among the four techniques for all the tasks, there are several findings from the study that we think are useful for uncertainty visualization design. We found a significant difference in user performance between searching for locations of high and searching for locations of low uncertainty. Errorbars consistently underperformed throughout the experiment. Scaling the size of glyphs and color-mapping of the surface performed reasonably well. The efficiency of most of these techniques were highly dependent on the tasks performed. We believe that these findings can be used in future uncertainty visualization design. In addition, the framework developed in this user study presents a structured approach to evaluate uncertainty visualization techniques, as well as provides a basis for future research in uncertainty visualization.

Additionally, food preference information was collected so that kindergarteners' knowledge about the Dietary Guidelines could be compared with their food choices. Design and subjects Focus-group interviews were conducted in two elementary schools with 12 groups of about five students each (n=62). Four classrooms were self-selected depending on the teacher's willingness to facilitate student participation; the sample was not random. Results Students understood the general relationship between food choices, exercise, body fat, and sugar and were able to name foods high in salt, fat, and sugar and thought consumption of sugary or fatty foods should be limited. Nevertheless, their food preferences were not consistent with recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines to moderate foods high in these nutrients. Applications Nutrition educators should be aware that young children might not understand terms frequently used such as animal sources of foods or variety. Students know what to eat, but their practices are inconsistent with their knowledge. Providing information about what to do is not enough. To help students transfer factual information to personal dietary practices, nutrition educators need to teach them how to apply the Dietary Guidelines within their food environment while maintaining acceptability in regard to taste.

What we imagine learning from watching others: how motor imagery modulates competency perceptions resulting from the repeated observation of a juggling action	PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH-PSYCHOLOGISCHE FORSCHUNG			English	Article							EXCITABILITY; PERFORMANCE; OBSERVERS; MODEL	Although motor learning can occur from observing others perform a motor skill (action observation; AO), observers' confidence in their own ability to perform the skill can be falsely increased compared to their actual ability. This illusion of motor competence (i.e., 'over-confidence') may arise because the learner does not gain access to sensory feedback about their own performance-a source of information that can help individuals understand their veridical motor capabilities. Unlike AO, motor imagery (MI; the mental rehearsal of a motor skill) is thought to be linked to an understanding of movement consequences and kinaesthetic information. MI may thus provide the learner with movement-related diagnostic information, leading to greater accuracy in assessing ability. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of MI when paired with AO in assessments of one's own motor capabilities in an online observation task. Two groups rated their confidence in performing a juggling task following repeated observations of the action without MI (OBS group; n = 45) or with MI following observation (OBS+MI; n = 39). As predicted, confidence increased with repeated observation for both groups, yet increased to a greater extent in the OBS relative to the OBS+MI group. The addition of MI appeared to reduce confidence that resulted from repeated AO alone. Data support the hypothesis that AO and MI are separable and that MI allows better access to sensory information than AO. However, further research is required to assess changes in confidence that result from MI alone and motor execution.

Role of Sex, Socioeconomic Status, and Emotional Support in Predicting Aging Perception Among Older Adults	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGING & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						aging perception; socioeconomic status; emotional support; older; sex; elder		Self-perception is found to be a central predictive factor in experiencing successful aging. The aim of this study was to explore the role of sex, socioeconomic status, and emotional support in elders' aging perception. A cross-sectional design was used with 300 older aged participants recruited from 23 clinics and health centers in Qazvin, Iran. Data were collected included questions to elicit demographic information and Barker's aging perception questionnaire. Exploratory multiple linear regression showed that the level of emotional support (beta: -12.10; 95% CI: [-20.72, -3.48]), socioeconomic status (beta: 2.84; 95% CI: [0.25, 5.43]), and women (beta: -4.34; 95% CI: [-6.91, -1.77]) were associated with aging perception among elders. Educational level and marital status did not significantly contribute to the variance of AP. Findings revealed that aging perception was related to individual differences as well as social and emotional factors. Researchers, health-care professionals, and elders may benefit from thinking about old age as an inevitable life stage.

J	Tabak, N; Itzhaki, M; Sharon, D; Barnoy, S				Tabak, Nili; Itzhaki, Michal; Sharon, Dganit; Barnoy, Sivia			Intentions of nurses and nursing students to tell the whole truth to patients and family members	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						intention; nurses; nursing students; patients; subjective norm; Theory of Planned Behaviour; truth telling	CANCER-PATIENTS; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; DIAGNOSIS; ATTITUDES; ISSUES; COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION; EXPERIENCES; DISCLOSURE; PREVENTION	Aims and objectives To investigate the intentions of nurses and nursing students to telling the truth to patients and families, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior which examines intention to perform behaviours. Background In recent decades, the perception that patients have a moral and legal right to truthful and reliable information has become dominant. However, the study of telling the truth to non-oncology patients has received scant attention and little is known about the intention of nurses and nursing students to tell the truth. Design A cross-sectional design. Methods We used a scenario-based questionnaire, illustrating eight different situations in which nurses/nursing students are asked to tell the truth to a patient or family member regarding a devastating disease with which the patient is afflicted. Data were analysed using the MannWhitney U-test and ridge regression. Results The sample included 150 participants, 110 registered nurses and 40 third year nursing students, with a response rate of 87%. The results show that nurses and nursing students intend to tell the whole truth even if this is not easy for them. Nurses more than students think that it is important to tell the whole truth and intend to do so. Head nurses tend to tell the truth more than staff nurses. For nurses, the components of the Theory of Planned Behaviour predicted intention to tell the truth, whereas among students subjective norms were the only predictor of intention. Conclusion The Theory of Planned Behaviour is a powerful predictor of nurse intention to tell the whole truth to patients and their families. Students perceive social pressure as the most important incentive of their intention to tell the truth. Relevance to clinical practice Nurses and nursing students should receive additional training in dealing with various situations involving truth telling.

This study extends the scientific knowledge about the impacts related to the notarisation of mandatory sustainability reports through a publicly available blockchain. Design/methodology/approach Building on the idea journey framework, this paper presents the case study of Banca Mediolanum in Italy, a first-mover who notarised its non-financial declaration on a public blockchain to mitigate the information asymmetries that negatively impact stakeholder engagement. Findings The analysis reveals that the notarisation of the non-financial reports through a publicly available blockchain can represent a tool useful to mitigate the asymmetric information between organisations and stakeholders. Practical implications Although academics and practitioners have observed the benefits of its implementation, only a few companies have adopted blockchain systems to ensure their information's reliability. The findings underline the opportunity for socially responsible organisations to signal their orientation towards sustainable development through the adoption of an innovative tool. Social implications The proliferation of non-financial reports prepared on mandatory basis mitigated the signalling effects related to the disclosure of non-financial information. The case study underlines the opportunity for socially responsible organisations to overcoming this criticism through notarisation. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study about sustainability reporting practices and blockchain. This research contributes to the currently scarce discussion about the role of blockchain in non-financial reporting. In addition, the authors contribute to the scientific conversation about the need to rethink assurance in non-financial reporting practices.

In agreement with the constructivist approach, in which learners build their own cognitive structure, many results have shown that learning through modelling positively contributes to conceptual adaptation. From this point of view, this study presents a cross-sectional study of secondary school learners??? schematic modelling abilities in the upper secondary school. The schematic modelling skills and competences of 216 students (15???18 years old, 10th???12th grade), ranging from purely macroscopic conceptions to an adequate interplay between the three levels of Johnstone???s triangle, have been assessed within selected contextualized situations. The data were collected using a three-part instrument, namely the analysis of the information contained in a graphical scheme, the perception of the role and relevance of schematic modelling, and the autonomous production of schematic modelling. The collected data show that 12th-grade students have a significantly higher capability of analysing the information of a scheme compared to 10th and 11th grades. Moreover, autonomous schematic modelling skills follow the same trend. The data also provide some evidence that students with better model analysis competences design higher quality autonomous models at the level.

WST is the core of an integrated body of theory that emerged from a long-term research project to develop a systems analysis and design method for business professionals called the work system method (WSM). After discussing WST's basic premises and its two central frameworks, this paper summarizes the relationship between WST and WSM. It shows how experience with early versions of WSM led to three extensions of WST that addressed limitations-in-use in one of the central frameworks in WST. After comparisons with related theories, this paper closes with an evaluation of progress to date, new directions for research related to WST, and implications for the IS discipline. The two appendices summarize the long term research from which WST emerged and use a positioning map to show how WST is related to other topics in the IS discipline.

J	Hadjichristidis, C; Geipel, J; Surian, L				Hadjichristidis, Constantinos; Geipel, Janet; Surian, Luca			How foreign language affects decisions: Rethinking the brain-drain model	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES			English	Article						language (language design, silent language, translation); decision making; social cognition; emotion; common corporate language	THINKING; EMOTION; SYSTEMS	Volk, Kohler, & Pudelko (JIBS 45: 862-885, 2014) propose that foreign language use depletes cognitive resources, thus hindering individual decision making and self-regulation. The present commentary highlights studies showing that foreign language use can also improve decision making and self-regulation. We propose that these benefits derive from two psychological factors. The first concerns the timing of cognitive depletion. Foreign language use involves an increase of memory load in the early phases of information processing, which has been shown to reduce the capture of attention by tempting stimuli. The second factor concerns the nature of human memory. Experiences and their associated emotions are coded in the language in which they occur, and thus are more accessible when the same language is used at retrieval. Therefore certain mental constructs, such as stereotypes, which have been shaped by years of cultural learning in a native language context, may exert less influence when processing a foreign language. The present treatment indicates value in extending Volk et al. 's conceptual model, and can help develop language strategies that may ultimately improve organizational decision making.

J	Yildirim, B				Yildirim, Bekir			Flipped TRIZ-STEM: Enhancing teacher training through innovative pedagogy?	EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Early Access						STEM education; Flipping learning; Mixed research; Teacher	CREATIVITY; EDUCATION	This study aimed to examine the effects of TRIZ-STEM applications within an online flipped learning model on teachers' problem-solving skills, creative thinking dispositions, STEM teaching, and their understanding of the nature of engineering. The sample consisted of 57 teachers (24 in the control group and 33 in the experimental group) recruited using purposive convenience sampling. The study adopted a mixed embedded design. Quantitative data analysis included independent samples t-tests, paired samples t-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and effect size calculations. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze qualitative data, including the nature of the engineering questionnaire and lesson plans. The experimental group engaged in TRIZ-STEM activities using an online flipped learning model, while the control group engaged in face-to-face TRIZ-STEM education activities. The results showed that online TRIZ-STEM education had a greater positive impact on teachers' perspectives on engineering nature than face-to-face TRIZ-STEM education. On the other hand, face-to-face TRIZ-STEM education was much more effective in helping participants develop problem-solving skills than online flipped learning TRIZ-STEM education. However, the online flipped learning model did not show superiority in improving teachers' creative thinking education and STEM teaching compared to the face-to-face approach. Based on the results, suggestions for future research were provided, emphasizing the potential of online flipped learning models for STEM teacher education.

J	Castro, AL; Koiller, J				Castro, Alex Lucio; Koiller, Jair			On the dynamic Markov-Dubins problem: From path planning in robotics and biolocomotion to computational anatomy	REGULAR & CHAOTIC DYNAMICS			English	Article						geometric mechanics; calculus of variations; Markov-Dubins problem	CURVATURE; CURVES	Andrei Andreyevich Markov proposed in 1889 the problem (solved by Dubins in 1957) of finding the twice continuously differentiable (arc length parameterized) curve with bounded curvature, of minimum length, connecting two unit vectors at two arbitrary points in the plane. In this note we consider the following variant, which we call the dynamic Markov-Dubins problem (dM-D): to find the time-optimal C (2) trajectory connecting two velocity vectors having possibly different norms. The control is given by a force whose norm is bounded. The acceleration may have a tangential component, and corners are allowed, provided the velocity vanishes there. We show that for almost all the two vectors boundary value conditions, the optimization problem has a smooth solution. We suggest some research directions for the dM-D problem on Riemannian manifolds, in particular we would like to know what happens if the underlying geodesic problem is completely integrable. Path planning in robotics and aviation should be the usual applications, and we suggest a pursuit problem in biolocomotion. Finally, we suggest a somewhat unexpected application to "dynamic imaging science". Short time processes (in medicine and biology, in environment sciences, geophysics, even social sciences?) can be thought as tangent vectors. The time needed to connect two processes via a dynamic Markov-Dubins problem provides a notion of distance. Statistical methods could then be employed for classification purposes using a training set.

The numbers oft. acidophilus, rheological properties, acidity and pH values were determined both after the production and during the storage period of 21 days at 4 degrees C. In addition, sensory analyses of the beverages were done. The flow behavior of beverage was assessed by using three different rheological models, namely: Power Law, Herschel Bulkley and Vocallo models. Vocadlo model was selected as the best model fitting the experimental data. The beverage was found to be a pseudoplastic fluid having the shear thinning nature. The results showed that L. acidophilus had good growth and viability in the beverage with or without apple juice. L. acidophilus counts were in the range of 8.73-9.11 log cfu/g after storage at 4 degrees C for 21 days, thus they met required number of viable bacteria for probiotic functional food. Results revealed that this beverage could be a good vehicle to deliver probiotic microorganisms to consumers and carry a potential to become a commercial product. It is thought that the results of this study could provide valuable information for the design of pumping systems for the fermented soy milk beverages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Attention Modulates the Dorsal Striatum Response to Love Stimuli	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						love; motivation; emotion; reward; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)	NEURAL BASIS; REWARD; EMOTION; ACTIVATION; SYSTEMS; BRAIN; PICTURES; STATE	In previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies concerning romantic love, several brain regions including the caudate and putamen have consistently been found to be more responsive to beloved-related than control stimuli. In those studies, infatuated individuals were typically instructed to passively view the stimuli or to think of the viewed person. In the current study, we examined how the instruction to attend to, or ignore the beloved modulates the response of these brain areas. Infatuated individuals performed an oddball task in which pictures of their beloved and friend served as targets and distractors. The dorsal striatum showed greater activation for the beloved than friend, but only when they were targets. The dorsal striatum actually tended to show less activation for the beloved than the friend when they were distractors. The longer the love and relationship duration, the smaller the response of the dorsal striatum to beloved-distractor stimuli was. We interpret our findings in terms of reinforcement learning. By virtue of using a cognitive task with a full factorial design, we show that the dorsal striatum is not activated by beloved-related information per se, but only by beloved-related information that is attended.

J	Chen, YC; Kong, DY				Chen, Youcheng; Kong, Deyi			An Investigation on Factors in The Integration of Reciprocal Teaching into Multimedia Teaching	EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						Reciprocal Teaching; multimedia teaching; comprehension; learning effectiveness	HELP-SEEKING; STUDENTS	The popularity of the Internet has toppled people's thinking models and teaching styles as well as influenced the operation of school education. In teaching processes, computers could attract students' attention through vivid images, bright colors and characters, and sound to further promote their learning concentration and interests. Research on the application of integrating information into instruction is increasing, and lots of studies prove that technology could help students' learning and improve their learning attitudes. In this study, the nonequivalent pretest posttest control group design is utilized for the quasi-experiment research. Total 236 students in two classes each from Xiamen University and Fuzhou University in Fujian Province are selected as the research objects for the 32week experimental instruction for 3 hours per week (total 96 hours). The research results reveal 1. significant effects of adventure education on comprehension, 2. remarkable effects of adventure education on learning effectiveness, 3. the best promotion of comprehension with Reciprocal Teaching under multimedia teaching, and 4. the best promotion of learning effectiveness with Reciprocal Teaching under multimedia teaching. The results are further discussed to propose specific suggestions in this study. It is expected to enhance teachers' teaching skills and promote students' learning effectiveness.

During this quarantine, communication systems have been characterized bydisintermediation, theacceleration of digitizationand aninfodemic(excess and saturation of information). The following debate arises: Do the levels related tothe psychotic phenotypeandpseudoscientific beliefsrelated to the interpretation of information vary before and after social quarantine? Objectives This research aims to examine the psychological effects of social quarantine on the psychotic phenotype and pseudoscientific beliefs-experiences of the general nonclinical population. The following hypothesis was posed: social quarantine alters the levels of magical thinking, pseudoscientific beliefs and anomalous perceptions due to quarantine. Methods Apre- and posttestanalysis design was applied based on the difference in means, and complementaryBayesianestimation was performed. A total of 174 Spanish subjects responded to different questionnaires that evaluated psychopathological risks based on psychotic phenotypes, pseudoscientific beliefs and experiences before and after quarantine. Results Significant differences were obtained for the variablespositive psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms,and certainperceptual alterations(e.g.,cenesthetic perceptions), and a significant increase in pseudoscientific beliefs was also observed. The perceptual disturbances that increased the most after quarantine were those related toderealizationanddepersonalization. However,paranoid perceptionsshowed the highest increase, doubling the initial standard deviation. These high increases could be related to the delimitation of physical space during social quarantine and distrust towards information communicated by the government to the population. Is it possible that social alarmism generated by the excess of information and pseudoscientific information has increased paranoid perceptual alterations? Conclusions Measures taken after quarantine indicate that perceptual disturbances, subclinical psychotic symptoms and beliefs in the pseudoscience have increased. We discuss which elements of quarantine coincide with the social marginality theory and its clinical repercussions.

J	Wei, PC; Zou, Y				Wei, Peng Cheng; Zou, Yang			Image Feature Extraction and Object Recognition Based on Vision Neural Mechanism	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Neurological vision; image processing; image feature extraction; object recognition	TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION	As an important branch of artificial intelligence, computer vision plays a huge role in the rapid development of artificial intelligence. From a biological point of view, in the acquisition and processing of information, vision is much more important than hearing, touch, etc., because 70% of the human cerebral cortex is processing visual information. Therefore, advances in computer vision technology are critical to the development of artificial intelligence that is designed to allow machines to think and handle things like humans. The acquisition and processing of visual information has always been the focus of computer vision research, and it is also difficult. The main problem of traditional computer vision technology in the processing of visual information is that the extracted image features are less discriminative, the generalization ability of image features in complex background scenes is insufficient, and the recognition ability on object recognition is poor. In response to these problems, based on the visual neural mechanism, this paper establishes an appropriate computer model for the neuronal cells in the human primary visual cortex, models the recognition response mechanism of the visual ventral system, and performs image feature extraction on the training samples. And object recognition. The results show that compared with the traditional methods, the proposed method effectively improves the discrimination of image features, and the image features extracted under complex background scenes have good generalization ability. On this basis, the training samples can be effectively recognized. The results show that the model based on the visual neural mechanism, the recognition of the edge, orientation and contour of the training sample show the advantages of the biological vision mechanism in object recognition.

In this study, two novel OBP genes of the scarab beetle Holotrichia oblita were screened using an antennal cDNA library. The full cDNA of HoblOBP3 and HoblOBP4 was cloned using reverse transcription PCR and rapid amplification of the cDNA ends. Homology modeling of both OBPs was performed using SWISS-MODEL on-line tools. Next, the two OBPs were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using Ni ion affinity chromatography. The ligand-binding properties of HoblOBP3 and HoblOBP4 in 42 ligands respectively were measured using the fluorescence probe N-phenyl-naphthylamine (1-NPN). The results obtained from competitive binding assays demonstrated that HoblOBP4 showed a broader range of binding affinities to the test compounds, while HoblOBP3 displays more specific binding affinity. Furthermore, other OBPs and CSPs were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using Ni ion affinity chromatography. Binding curves were measured for binary mixtures of OBPs and CSPs using 1-NPN, and the Scatchard plots exhibited "J"-like nonlinear correlation trends in some samples. In addition, competitive binding assays of the HoblOBP1 and HoblOBP2 mixtures and of the HoblOBP2 and HoblOBP4 mixtures with representative compounds unexpectedly demonstrated good affinity, which revealed extreme differences that were only obtained using the individual proteins. In the immunocytochemical analysis, colocalization of HoblOBP1 and HoblOBP2, and of HoblOBP2 and HoblOBP4, was detected in the sensilla basiconica and sensilla placodea, respectively. All of these results suggested that HoblOBP1 and HoblOBP2, as well as HoblOBP2 and HoblOBP4, may serve as heterodimers in the sensillum lymph.

The aim was to identify beliefs about pain and recovery present in the narratives of individuals with WAD and to understand how and why individuals' came to hold these beliefs. Design A qualitative study. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis of semi-structured interviews. Participants Participants (n = 20) were enrolled in a large, pragmatic randomised controlled trial of physiotherapy for acute WAD. Participants were interviewed after they completed their treatment. Results A range of beliefs were evident. These included beliefs about exercise and activity, ability to self-manage symptoms, expectations of recovery and competing priorities. Some beliefs appeared to be barriers to recovery despite all participants having consulted several health professionals. Health professionals were highly influential over how individuals' thought about and managed their injury. The pain experienced influenced how individuals thought and behaved as did past experiences of injury and illness. Competing priorities were a potential barrier to engaging with treatment. We identified examples of how beliefs and behaviour changed in response to information from health professionals and the pain they experienced. Conclusion People with WAD hold a range of beliefs about pain and recovery and some appear unhelpful to recovery. Health professionals can influence these beliefs and encourage behaviours that aid recovery. Understanding how patients form beliefs may help health professionals to address unhelpful beliefs. It is important that advice and education provided is in line with the current evidenced based understanding of pain and recovery. (C) 2014 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.

A method for mapping areal boundaries has been formulated based on the large-scale spatial characteristics of regional interaction revealed by resting state functional connectivity. In the present study, we present a novel analysis for areal boundary mapping that requires only the signal timecourses within a region of interest, without reference to the information from outside the region. The areal boundaries were generated by the novel analysis and were compared with those generated by the previously-established standard analysis. The boundaries were robust and reproducible across the two analyses, in two regions of interest tested. These results suggest that the information for areal boundaries is readily available inside the region of interest.

Background: Intravenous FT is thought to be important in the early management of patients with AP. Clinically relevant questions remain regarding the type of fluid, the rate of administration, and the goal of FT. Methods: A comprehensive literature search for human studies was performed using online databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library). The quality of the entire body of evidence was then graded according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group guidelines in relation to 3 key areas: type of fluid, rate of fluid administration, and goal-directed FT. Results: The initial search yielded 410 studies, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. Only 2 randomized studies compared types of fluids. Nine studies looked at aggressive versus nonaggressive resuscitation protocols, of which 4 concluded that an aggressive approach yielded better outcomes and 5 concluded that a nonaggressive approach was better. Two studies investigated goal-directed FT, using different goals; one demonstrating benefit and the other none. Analysis of the body of evidence as per the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group revealed that the majority of evidence was of low or very low quality. Conclusions: FT is considered a cornerstone of the early management of patients with AP and yet the evidence on which it is based remains paltry and of poor quality. This systematic review has demonstrated the equipoise necessary for the design of randomized controlled trials to answer pressing questions relating to the type of fluid, the rate of administration, and how FT should be guided.

The current study aimed to design and implement a MABI integrated into the badminton training of young elite players (MBI programme), and to investigate its impact on sport performance-related outcomes. Design: Two stages: (a) design and implementation of the MBI programme, and (b) evaluation using a mixed methods approach. Method: Participants were young elite badminton players, assigned either to the 8-week MBI programme (n = 18; M-age = 16.22), or the 8-week placebo programme (n = 11; M-age = 16.64). Participants completed preand post-intervention measures of mindfulness skills, cognitive interference, and performance satisfaction. Social validation interviews were conducted with MBI participants to collect their overall perceptions of the programme. Results: MANCOVA indicated a large intervention effect on the main outcome variables (partial eta(2) = 0.58). The results of univariate ANCOVAs showed that post-intervention awareness, performance worries and task-irrelevant thoughts differed significantly across the groups. In addition, follow-up t-tests provided additional information regarding changes from pre- to post-intervention among the MBI and control groups separately. Social validation data gave further insights into what athletes had retained and applied from the MBI programme. Conclusions: Contrasting results highlighted the need to better explore mindfulness mechanisms in MABI and the way they are inter-related, in order to strengthen changes in sport performance-related outcomes.

J	Pascual-García, A				Pascual-Garcia, Alberto			A constructive approach to the epistemological problem of emergence in complex systems	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FORMAL EPISTEMOLOGY; DOWNWARD CAUSATION; ORGANIZATION; CONSTRAINTS; SELECTION; TOPOLOGY; BIOLOGY; OBJECTS	Emergent patterns in complex systems are related with many intriguing phenomena in modern science. One question that has sparked vigorous debates is if difficulties in the modelization of emergent behaviours are a consequence of ontological or epistemological limitations. To elucidate this question, we propose a novel approximation through constructive logic. Under this framework, experimental measurements will be considered conceptual building blocks from which we aim to achieve a description of the microstates ensemble mapping the macroscopic emergent observation. This procedure allow us to have full control of any information loss, thus making the analysis of different systems fairly comparable. In particular, we aim to look for compact descriptions of the constraints underlying a dynamical system, as a necessary a priori step to develop explanatory (mechanistic) models. We apply our proposal to a synthetic system to show that the number and scope of the system's constraints hinder our ability to build compact descriptions, being those systems under global constraints a limiting case in which such a description is unreachable. This result clearly links the epistemological limits of the framework selected with an ontological feature of the system, leading us to propose a definition of emergence strength which we make compatible with the scientific method through the active intervention of the observer on the system, following the spirit of Granger causality. We think that our approximation clarifies previous discrepancies found in the literature, reconciles distinct attempts to classify emergent processes, and paves the way to understand other challenging concepts such as downward causation.

J	Taghiyareh, F; Nagahashi, H				Taghiyareh, F; Nagahashi, H			BPL: A language for parallel algorithms on the butterfly network	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						parallel algorithms; parallel processing; butterfly network; parallel languages		A number of parallel algorithms have been developed to solve large-scale real world problems. Although there has been much work on the design of parallel algorithms, there has been little on the design of Languages for expressing these algorithms. This paper describes the BPL, a new parallel language designed for butterfly networks. The purpose of this language is to help designers in hiding the complexity of the algorithm and leaving details of mapping between data and processors for lower level. BPL provides a simpler virtual machine for the designer, in order to avoid thinking about control of processors and data. From another point of view, BPL helps designer to logically check the algorithm and correct ang. possible error in it. The paper gives some examples implemented by this language. In addition, we have also implemented a software toot which simulates the running of the algorithm on the network. The results lead us to believe that this language would be useful in representing all kinds of algorithms on this network including normal algorithms and others.

For the simulation of the trajectory of a single ion in a collision-free system, the calculated spatial trajectory components, kinetic energies and secular frequencies from the three simulators were virtually identical. It is concluded that, despite the various approaches to electrode design, calculation of fields, integration methods and ion generation tactics, there is a remarkable degree of consistency among the products of the simulators when dealing with collision-free conditions. The results of the ion injection simulations under collisional conditions were indicative of the complexity that can be introduced into the simulations with little effort. Random effects such as collisions of ions with He buffer gas and accumulated calculation errors together with the different collision model settings and the different approaches to field calculation are thought to have contributed to the somewhat minor differences in trapping efficiency. SIMION is the simulator of choice for the simulation of ion trajectories in hybrid instruments and in custom-designed assemblies of electrodes; and ITSIM would appear to be the best choice on the basis of computational speed for running multiparticle simulations and user friendliness. Both ISIS and ITSIM are adept at providing detailed information of collision events, Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The paper describes older participants' preferences for, and their contribution to, the application design. Technology to assess movements is available in smartphones with built-in sensors, and one of the challenges is to develop a valuable self-test for older adults. The participants contributed to the design of the application's instructions and user interface. Multiple data collection methods were used: user-test with Think aloud method, mock-ups, homework assignment as co-researcher, audio and video recordings. Qualitative content analysis with a deductive-inductive approach was used, guided by the Optimized Honeycomb model for user experience (UX) as a categorization matrix. The analysis resulted in 17 subcategories within the seven facets of the UX Honeycomb model (findable, accessible, usable, desirable, credible, useful, and valuable), and describes the older participants' preferences and experiences. The main results were participants' desire to know why, to get clear and appropriate information, and expectations of the self-test to be useful. It was feasible and valuable to develop the self-test application in co-creation with the intended user-group, in order to get direct feedback and suggestions for the development.

J	Kim, JM; Lee, E; Yoon, Y				Kim, Jong Min; Lee, Eunkyung; Yoon, Yeosun			Bringing culture into the picture: cross-cultural differences in online customer reviews	INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REVIEW			English	Review						Online customer review; Electronic word of mouth; Herding; Cross-cultural difference; Analytic-holistic processing	WORD-OF-MOUTH; NEGATIVE REVIEWS; SELF; PRODUCT; CONSUMERS; IMPACT; BIAS; DIAGNOSTICITY; COMMUNICATION; HELPFULNESS	Purpose Prior literature on online customer reviews (OCRs) suggests that individuals are socially influenced by information shared by others. Given that the online environment brings together users from different cultures, understanding how users differ in their processing and generation of OCRs across cultures is imperative. Specifically, this paper explores how cross-cultural differences influence OCR generation when there are inconsistencies between recent and overall review ratings. Design/methodology/approach The authors employ an empirical study and an experimental approach to test the predictions. For the empirical study (Study 1), the authors collected and analyzed actual review data from an online hotel review platform, Booking.com. This was followed by an experimental study (Study 2) in which the authors manipulated the thinking style represented by each cultural orientation to further explain how and why cross-cultural differences exist. Findings The results show that compared with the review ratings of users from collectivist cultures, those of users from individualistic cultures are more likely to follow recent review ratings. Based on the experimental study, the authors further find that such cross-cultural differences in OCR generation are driven by differences in thinking style. Originality/value This research extends the literature by demonstrating the cross-cultural differences in individuals' herding tendencies in OCR generation. The authors also add to the literature by showing in which direction OCR herding occurs when there is a discrepancy between overall and recent review ratings. From a managerial perspective, the findings provide guidelines for online platforms serving the global market on predicting customers' OCR generation and constructing appropriate response strategies.

The questionnaire was administered to collect the ICT supporting conditions in school (ISCS) and the ICT application in school (IAIS) for each school. Among the ISCS factors, the ICT Environment and School Scale were indicated as being significant predictors of IAIS. In addition, the significant predictive relationship between the ISCS and the IAIS factors for rural schools was much stronger than for urban schools. This indicates that the rural and urban schools in China are now at different ICT development stages. Furthermore, rural schools should focus on the improvement of physical ICT infrastructure and the quality digital resources, whereas urban schools should try to improve teachers' inadequate epistemic beliefs and design thinking ability. Nevertheless, there are other external and individual-level factors that could directly and indirectly influence schools' ICT application in education.
