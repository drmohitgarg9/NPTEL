An adversary can fabricate the information being exchanged between system components, which may cause false tripping of the installed protection devices. This creates the need for an anomaly diagnosis scheme that can distinguish between faults and cyber attacks to attain a reliable and secure system under large signal disturbances. This work presents a machine learning-based anomaly diagnosis scheme which characterizes these anomalies. The scheme uses the well-known XGBoost approach, and requires local measurements (such as, active power, reactive power, and frequency) of inverter-interfaced distributed energy resources (IIDERs). Since such measurements may be difficult for participants in a system to share across organizational boundaries due to commercial or regulatory concerns, the proposed approach obfuscates the measurements by additive noise while preserving detection accuracy. This scheme was tested on an AC MG network with four IIDERs, modeled on a real-time simulation platform in an OPAL-RT environment. The results validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed scheme under different conditions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Anomaly diagnosis; Cyber attacks; Cyber–physical system; Faults; Inverters; Privacy-preserving; XGBoost","Additive noise; Anomaly detection; Computer crime; Crime; Electric inverters; Microgrids; Network security; Reactive power; Renewable energy; Anomaly diagnosis; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-physical systems; Distributed Energy Resources; Fault; Inverter; Microgrid; Privacy preserving; Xgboost; Simulation platform","Gupta, K.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: Kirti.Gupta@ee.iitd.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",23524677,,,,"English","Sustain.

It prevents potential failures in rotating machines in maritime systems. Simultaneously developed faults severely damage the machines, leading to unprecedented incidents and higher maintenance costs. Data availability for developing multi-fault diagnosis solutions is limited, creating maintainability problems. The unavailability of data also causes further obstacles in the accurate diagnosis of machines. The efficiency of maritime machinery can be improved with intelligent diagnosis by advanced machine learning algorithms. This paper proposes a methodology to diagnose multi-faults with balanced and imbalanced acoustic, vibration and current signals datasets. After acquiring the data from an experimental setup under various speeds, a time-frequency-based Stepping Frame Synchrosqueezed Fourier Transform (SFSFT) is deployed in each segmented signal prior to feature extraction. The extracted features are used for training the Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). Different balanced and imbalanced datasets are created to check the multi-fault classification ability of the proposed methodology. The results show that SFSFT-RBFNN is a generalised methodology, which performed tremendously well with a maximum classification accuracy of 100 % for balanced and imbalanced datasets in all three modality datasets. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Fourier synchrosqueezed transform; Imbalance data; Maritime rotating machines; Multi-faults diagnosis; Neural network; Stepping frame","Classification (of information); Fault detection; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Maintenance; Radial basis function networks; Rotating machinery; Fourier; Fourier synchrosqueezed transform; Imbalance datum; Maritime rotating machine; Multi faults; Multi-fault diagnosis; Neural-networks; Radial basis function neural networks (RBF); Rotating machine; Stepping frame; Failure analysis","Fatima, S.; Centre for Automotive Research and Tribology, India; email: fatima@iitd.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",09521976,,EAAIE,,"English","Eng Appl Artif Intell",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85183938536

However, most conventional AIPS fails to detect unintentional islanding event during perfectly matched loading conditions. To overcome this issue, in this article, a hybrid islanding detection algorithm has been proposed based on the rate of change of kinetic energy and root-mean-square value of absolute frequency deviation at the point of common coupling (PCC). The methodology presents a significant contribution prior to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the disturbance injection mechanism through the q-axis current control loop of the grid-tied inverter. The method activates the disturbance signal injection mechanism only when an unintentional islanding event is suspected based on monitoring certain parameters at the PCC. This mechanism has been proposed to have zero nondetection zone, very fast operation, straightforward implementation, and significantly less impact on the power quality and stability of the power electronics system. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated by conducting 200+ islanding and nonislanding case studies in simulation as well as an experimental platform. The proposed method is robust, accurate, and fast enough to detect an islanding event cleverly with a detection time as small as 120 ms. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Distributed generation (DG); disturbunce injection; islanding identification; protection; rate of change of kinetic energy (ROCOKE); real-time digital simulator (RTDS); typhoon hardware-in-loop (HIL)","Distributed power generation; Electric equipment protection; Electric fault currents; Electric inverters; Electric power system protection; Kinetics; Power quality; Reactive power; Distributed generation; Disturbunce injection; Hardware in loop; Inverter; Islanding; Islanding identification; Protection; Rate of change; Rate of change of kinetic energy; Real-time digital simulator; Typhoon hardware-in-loop; Kinetic energy","Patekar, R.S.; Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India; email: rakesh.shamrao.patekar@ee.iitd.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",02780046,,ITIED,,"English","IEEE Trans Ind Electron",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85165341000

A buck-based active power decoupling (APD) converter is employed to solve this issue of double-line-frequency ripple. By operating the APD converter with variable switching frequency, a critical condition mode (CRM) is achieved, which ensures soft switching of both the switches of APD converter. However, high-attenuation-based digital filters in both voltage and current loops are necessary in variable-switching-frequency-based control, which introduces new dynamics in the control loop. This limits the ability of the controller to rapidly adjust the decoupling capacitor voltage with change in output power. In this article, a novel control method is proposed for the APD converter, which entitles the design of a faster decoupling control, while ensuring the system stability and efficiency during dynamic periods. Although the proposed control results in higher robustness and improved transient response, the original dynamics of the system remain unaffected.

Moreover, remote geographical allocation of wind farm installations demands power quality (PQ) improvement features, where the WT becomes a significant contributor to grid stability. This article presents a real-time implementation of a seamless transition of DFIG-based WT with the grid. The seamless transition process is aided by accurate phase angle estimates from a half-tangent phase-locked loop (PLL) technique, which is an improved version of synchronous reference frame (SRF) based PLL. The phase detector of SRF-PLL is aided with HT function, which improves the accuracy at steady state and has faster dynamics under large frequency excursions.

The adaptive filter is based on a fractional-order gradient-descent total least mean p-norm algorithm. The benefit of this algorithm compared to its parent total least square methods is its ability to repress impulse noises in the eccentricities of the signal, showing a better convergence rate.

To maintain postural balance during gait initiation, individuals with lower extremity amputation over-depend on visual inputs and somatosensory information from the sound limb. This additional demand leads to higher cognitive load and additional extension and flexion torque in the healthy limb, leading to the unacceptability of current prostheses. In this study, a biomechanically relevant ankle-foot prosthesis model with a fractional order filter-based internal model control-based proportional integral derivative approach was explored to estimate the required control torque on the prosthetic ankle joint during dynamic weight-shifting activities in different visual environments. The results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in adapting the balance uncertainties in different visual conditions. Pilot findings during weight shifting exercises show that the proposed f -IMC-PID and traditional IMC-PID controllers present a maximum RMSE between the experimental and achieved lean angles of 0.01371° and 0.08414°, respectively. In addition, the present work compares the two baseline postural models: the shock absorption inverted pendulum model and the inverted pendulum-based virtual model.

This work assesses the performance of a shipboard microgrid (SMG) in the context of a zero-carbon, all-electric ferry. Nonlinear service loads, RESs with power-electronic converters, and propulsion motor give rise to severe power quality issues. Thus, an arctangent logarithmic hyperbolic cosine adaptive filter (ATLHCAF) is used to mitigate power quality issues. An inclusion of power quality control is imperative to ensure that total harmonic distortion (THD) adheres to IEEE 519-2022 and IEC 60092-101 standards.

As a result, several attack detection and reconstruction techniques are deployed, which makes it a costly &#x0026; complex cybersecurity operational platform with significant room for incremental extensions for mitigation against future threats. Unlike the said traditional arrangements, our paper introduces a foundational approach by establishing a monolithic cybersecurity architecture (MCA) via incorporating semantic principles into the sampling process for distributed energy resources (DERs). This unified approach concurrently compensates for the intrusion challenges posed by cyber attacks by reconstructing signals using the dynamics of the inner control layer. This reconstruction considers essential semantic attributes, like Priority, Freshness, and Relevance to ensure resilient dynamic performance. Hence, the proposed scheme promises a generalized route to concurrently tackle a global set of cyber attacks in elevating the resilience of PES. Finally, rigorous validation on a modified IEEE 69-bus distribution system and a real-world South California Edison (SCE) 47-bus network, using OPAL-RT under diverse operating conditions, underscores its robustness, model-free design capability, scalability, and adaptability to dynamic cyber graphs and system reconfiguration.

The traditional over-current protection of such CLs may face difficulty due to variable control action of the WTG and power electronic-based voltage support devices (e.g. STATCOM) at collector substation bus (CSB). In this paper, a superimposed least-square approach based transient detector phase coefficient of modal current for detecting faulty CLs/TL and magnitude coefficients of phase currents for identifying the accurate faulty phase of the CLs for two standard multi-segment test systems.

These types of faults occur when the primary electrical conductor fails or comes into contact with high-impedance substances, such as asphalt, grass, sand, concrete, etc. The magnitude of fault current is particularly low for certain grounding materials due to the nonlinear and high impedance of resistive surfaces. As a result, traditional overcurrent relays usually fail to operate, which may lead to fire hazards. Also, they are unable to detect the characteristics of HIF accurately, leading to maloperation. The motive of this work is to overcome the above-mentioned challenges of conventional relays. This article proposes a linear time-frequency wavelet-based tool called synchro-squeezing transform (SST) for the distortion detection of HIF in power distribution networks. This study uses wavelet SST to redistribute signal energy in the frequency domain. The wavelet SST is applied to the measured phase current signal for maximum time-frequency ridge extraction. Then, the inverse SST operation is performed to reconstruct the signal from the time-frequency domain. The reconstruction error is calculated between the original signal and the reconstructed signal. The reconstruction error value is compared with the base value to discriminate HIF from other non-HIF events. The impact of distributed generation on HIF features are further explored by EV penetration in the RSCAD distribution system and validated on the IEEE-13 node test feeder using RTDS. The main contributions of the proposed method are viz., it can correctly distinguish HIF from severe faults, switching events, energization scenarios, and noisy environments. The algorithm has been compared with the previously reported HIF detection techniques, and the efficacy of SST is presented through real-time simulation results. SST has a fast detection time and less computation burden. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Distortion; high-impedance fault (HIF); phase current; reconstruction error; synchro-squeezing transform (SST)","Electric fault currents; Electric power distribution; Electric power system protection; Errors; Extraction; Fault detection; Frequency domain analysis; Inverse problems; Relay protection; Signal reconstruction; Discrete-wavelet-transform; Features extraction; High impedance fault; High-impedance fault; Phase currents; Phase distortions; Power distributions; Reconstruction error; Synchro-squeezing transform; Wavelet-analysis; Discrete wavelet transforms","Chandrakar, R.; Indian Institute of Technology, India; email: ruchi.chandrakar@ee.iitd.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",19328184,,,,"English","IEEE Syst.

This article proposes a gain adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) with a modified phase-shift algorithm to facilitate EV fast charging at various levels of non-linear battery dynamics. The ASMC improves the front-end AC-DC charging performance with additional robustness by eliminating the conventional fixed gain control architecture and incorporating dynamic parameter updation at various levels of active or reactive power transmission. In order to support EV fast charging, a modified phase estimation technique is also proposed with an objective to minimize power-mismatch and phase-shift error during bi-directional charging phenomenon. In most of the existing phase-estimation techniques, voltage based PI-controller is used to determine the power transfer limit in bi-directional EV chargers without considering different charging modes and battery SOC. However, the presented control technique is entirely gain adaptive and includes the battery dynamics based upon constant current (CC) or constant voltage (CV) charging phenomenon.

The conventional IDTs are ineffective in GFMI due to the impact of power control droop parameters on the nondetection zone (NDZ). Also, the active IDTs may cause disturbances in the working operation of the GFMI due to their opposite functionality. Thus, there is a need to develop adequate IDTs which can perform robustly even with unconventional droop parameters and helps in maintaining the GFMI functions. In this work, THD from the rms voltage and current at the point of common coupling are extracted using the fast Fourier transform analysis. Then, a novel islanding detection factor (IDF) with adaptive weights is calculated. Finally, the statistical feature extracted from the IDF is compared with the threshold value to detect islanding.

The delayed response affects the overall charging dynamics with further controller phase lag and non-linear system parameters to induce a significant convergence error during reference command tracking. To effectively control multi-source integrated charging dynamics in an EV charging architecture, a projection-modified adaptive estimation (PMAE) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The control algorithm establishes a variable gain adaptation within a bounded error contour and updates the controller gains based on the tracking error dynamics gradient.

A line-compensated P-V droop control is utilized to prioritize power sharing among the several micro sources during the DC bus's excess/deficit power mode. With the multi-battery storage systems, the front-end bidirectional converter transfers power between the DC bus and the utility grid using line-compensated droop regulation. The proposed framework uses the power-sharing rule depending on the battery's state-of-charge (SoC) to extend battery life and boost the power support durability at CS. Moreover, it reduces the current stress of the batteries. Furthermore, It provides ancillary services such as harmonic reduction, utility reactive power support, and power support to CS's auxiliary load during grid islanding. DC bus voltage regulation is tested through various PV source power variations and load changes during the grid's interactive and autonomous modes.

The SPVS supplies uninterrupted power to the load by automatically regulating the DC link voltage during islanded operation (IO). A modified frequency locked loop (MFLL) is proposed, which reduces the frequency overshoot because of sudden phase angle jump in load voltage during synchronization process. The MFLL also reduces the second harmonic ripple present in the estimated frequency during distorted grid conditions and enables efficient estimation of the frequency. Hence, the MFLL reduces the number of false tripping of the power electronic switch (PES) and helps the SPVS to achieve smooth synchronization with the grid. The EFOGI-MFLL algorithm ensures efficient filtering of the load currents and improves the power quality of the SPVS in presence of nonlinearity or load current unbalance, without compromising the dynamic performance of the SPVS. During IO, the EFOGI filter ensures that the point of interconnection (PIC) voltages are linear, making the SPVS immune to any distortions in load currents. Furthermore, it blocks the DC offsets present in the sensed signals, which enhances its filtering ability. A comparative analysis demonstrates the advantages of the EFOGI-MFLL algorithm compared to other generalized integrator (GI) control algorithms.

Consequently, the performance of conventionally used distance relaying-based transmission line (TL) protection schemes are affected. The problem becomes further complicated when the interconnected TLs are compensated with unified power flow controller (UPFC). In this paper, an intelligent relaying scheme is proposed for efficient detection and classification of faults in such crucial TLs. In the proposed method, the suitable features are extracted from the locally measured current signals using variational mode decomposition (VMD). The main advantage of VMD is that it can extract the different frequency components of a faulted current signal adaptively with fast convergence. The extracted gray-scale images through VMD are utilized further by the deep convolution neural network (CNN) classifier for effective classification of faults. The efficacy of the proposed relaying algorithm is evaluated on 12000 fault and 120 non-fault cases generated on a system comprising of DFIG-wind farm and UPFC compensation using MATLAB/Simulink® and real time digital simulation platform (OP4510).

Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) based feedback control options viz. small-signal perturbations in the reference signals, and in the control gains are explored for the same. It is shown that, with full-state feedback of local control variables, the stability enhancement is not much effective with gain perturbations. Rather, the reference set-point change is shown to stabilize the inverter to weak-grid interconnection. Eliminating the need of communication assisted auxiliary inputs or the need for their estimation, the proposed approach is effective in achieving stability margin enhancement for wider range of X/R ratios and grid impedances. The cost of achieving stabilization using totally device-level information is the compromise made in set-point adjustment.

A prosthetic device with torque delivery is required to avoid such complications. However, estimating desired torque is an acknowledged challenge in this domain. Motivated by the above, this paper focuses on estimating the corrective torque required from an assistive device to balance the individual while performing weight-shifting exercises. Further, a healthy individual's inverted pendulum (IP) model is explored to model LLA's dynamics during weight-shifting. The model and the control strategy are validated using forward and backward body lean angles recorded from healthy and LLA individuals. Finally, a robust Proportional Integral Derivative controller is designed to estimate the corrective torque for maintaining the postural balance during weight-shifting. Along with the IP dynamics, a suitable control law based on Coefficient Diagram Method achieves the experimentally recorded body lean angle. The proposed control scheme is validated through simulation studies to evaluate the tracking performance in two different biomechanically relevant IP postural models. The findings assist in determining the external torque required to maintain the postural balance during gait initiation and compensatory measures for pathologically reduced torque. Note to Practitioners - Gait initiation is a transition between vertical posture and gait. Since vertical stance is inherently unstable, a postural adjustment occurs before gait initiates, propelling the center of mass forward and towards the first stance leg. The absence of flexor torque in the amputated limb causes a loss of postural stability during weight shifting activities. In the case of powered exoskeletons and prosthetic devices, a prior estimation of corrective torque through a computational approach helps to select a suitable actuator that provides an appropriate joint torque while maintaining the postural balance. As a result, an efficient computational model of gait initiation that accounts for neuromuscular system components before designing assistive devices is necessary. The controllers further provide corrective action to the assistive device to obtain robust and optimal coordination between the prosthetic element and gait. Therefore, this study demonstrates the significance of neuromuscular controller and assists in determining how much corrective torque from an external device is required to maintain postural stability and adaptability during weight shifting exercises. The effectiveness of the neural controller is also tested for real-time data to compensate for the effect of external disturbance and noise, thereby achieving a proper and controlled degree of movement in amputee users.

To identify bearing faults, complex time-frequency based signal processing techniques and high-end deep neural network algorithms have been used to perform fault classification, which is time-consuming. Method: In this paper, the focus was given to replace the complex time-frequency domain signal processing techniques by incorporating a simple time-domain based methodology. Initially, the vibration signature of different bearing faults was acquired at three different speeds and was directly converted into images by 2D-Vibration Imaging (2D-VI) technique using an overlapping-based moving window. The extracted images were fed into Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automatic feature extraction, followed by classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results and validation: Separately, time-frequency spectrums were also extracted to compare the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Furthermore, the proposed methodology was validated on the bearing dataset of combined faults and Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). Conclusion: The experimental results showed that the proposed methodology has the potential to replace the conventional approach by consuming less computational time without affecting classification accuracy. © 2022, Krishtel eMaging Solutions Private Limited.","CNN; Signal-to-image conversion; STFT; SVM; Time-domain analysis; Vibration analysis",,"Fatima, S.; Centre for Automotive Research and Tribology (CART), India; email: fatima@iitd.ac.in",,"Springer",25233920,,,,"English","J.

It operates under different modes of operations: 1) Daytime, in presence of sunlight, it transfers real power to three-phase loads and grid, also mitigates power quality issues and provides power balance, 2) During grid absence, it operates in standalone mode, gives power backup to local demand and stores excess solar generation into the battery storage (BS). 3) At night, in the absence of sunlight, the SPV-MG has zero power generation so the VSI (Voltage Source Inverter) acts as a Distribution Static Compensator (DSTATCOM). It is capable of providing reactive power compensation, power factor correction (PFC), harmonics elimination, voltage regulation etc. which in turn improves the utilization factor of devices by nearly double-fold. 4) It has re-synchronization and isolation capability with respect to grid availability.

By transforming traditional consumers into self-sustaining and utility consumers, CES facilitates interaction between consumers and utilities as well as between consumers. Residential CES development is complicated by the flexible capacity of CES batteries and the uncertainty of supply. This paper recommends the CES system for residential prosumers. A machine learning-based uncertainty quantization and an artificial ecosystem optimization (AEO) method are used to determine optimal battery capacity considering PV, load, and price uncertainty. Compare this algorithm to the other four optimization algorithms to find out how well it works. The feasibility and profitability of deploying CES with residential PV are assessed. This problem minimizes the user's cost and maximizes the profit of the CES operator. The sensitivity analysis of CES is analyzed for various storage capacity penetrations. Further, optimal battery capacity determines the use of an AEO algorithm.

However, exact forecasting of wind speed is challenging owing to its variable and stochastic nature. Further, many algorithms established for wind speed forecasting has neglected the missing value imputation study. In fact, the prediction accuracy of any forecasting system may suffer significantly if any missing data occurs during forecasting due to power off of any unexpected device, failure of communication/transmission equipment or sensor, measurement error, or other unknown causes. In order to take care of this, first k-NN imputation algorithm is used.

The State of Health (SOH) estimation is performed in the battery management system (BMS), which provides the qualitative measure of the capability of a lithium-ion battery (LIB), in terms of capacity or internal resistance. Theoretically, the cell capacity is obtained by complete charge and discharge of the cell but in practical scenario, complete charge or discharge is never the case. To address this issue of dynamic discharge, this paper presents an evolving model-based SOH estimation, predicting the capacity fade of the cell extracted from the incomplete discharge conditions as in the case of dynamic driving scenarios. The evolving algorithm uses Neural Network, which features an interval fuzzy set, with conjectural jump positions. For better identification of overlaps between the classes, the quantum fuzzy set uses graded membership function. The number of rules are automatically adjusted and evolved, in the quantum fuzzy set using Decoupled Extended Kalman Filter (DEKF) for parameter estimation. The proposed method uses voltage, current and sampling time data to estimate the capacity, over a period of 600 charging-discharging cycles of Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC) chemistry batteries. The dynamic discharge voltage data is obtained from the periodic characterization tests and is used for predict the complete discharge voltage. The full voltage profile has been forecasted using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network and the subsequent capacity has been estimated using evolving Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network (eQFNN) with an RMSE of less than 5% making it suitable for on-board applications.

Generally, four different battery states including the state of charge (SOC), state of energy (SOE), state of power (Power), and state of health (SOH) have been utilized to control and optimize the performance LIB used in electric vehicles (EV). Along with the SOH, the remaining useful life (RUL) is important to control the LIB performance and life. With technological advancement, there are several advanced battery state estimation algorithms have been developed for individual and combined states estimation methods. All the existing state estimation algorithms have their pros and cons. Therefore, there is a need of the state of art review and analyze the performance of existing advanced state estimation algorithms. In this paper, the existing individual, and combined states estimation algorithms suitable for SOC, SOE, SOP, and SOH are explored. Moreover, the mathematical formulas involved in state estimation are illustrated. Based on the critical findings from the literature review, a new combined states estimation method for SOC, SOE, SOH, and SOP is proposed to achieve a higher estimation accuracy and lower computational burden. The performance of the proposed combined states estimation algorithm is validated using a dynamic load profile under a wide range of operating temperature conditions. The experimental results show that the estimated SOC and SOE error is <2.5 % irrespective of the change in operating conditions. Further, the proposed method is capable of accurately estimating actual capacity and (dis)charge SOP, simultaneously. The estimated capacity converges to actual values within the first few seconds under considered operating conditions.

Due to the absence of prior knowledge or availability of ground-truth data, clustering of these images becomes a herculean task. Hence, unsupervised cluster detection methods are more beneficial for utilising hyperspectral images in real-life scenarios. In this paper, six multilevel quantum inspired metaheuristics are proposed viz., Qubit Genetic Algorithm, Qutrit Genetic Algorithm, Qubit Multi-exemplar Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm, Qutrit Multi-exemplar Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm, Qubit Artificial Humming Bird Algorithm, and Qutrit Artificial Humming Bird Algorithm, for determining the optimal number of clusters in hyperspectral images automatically. Binary and ternary quantum versions of the algorithms are developed to enhance their exploration and exploitation capabilities. Simple algorithms for implementing quantum rotation gates are developed to bring diversity in the population without resorting to look-up tables. One of the main features of quantum gates is that they are reversible in nature. This property has been utilized for implementing quantum disaster operations. The application of a dynamic number of exemplars also enhances the performance of the Multi-exemplar Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm. The six proposed algorithms are compared to the classical Genetic Algorithm, Multi-exemplar Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm, and Artificial Humming Bird Algorithm. All the nine algorithms are applied on three hyperspectral image datasets viz., Pavia University, Indian Pines, and Xuzhou HYSPEX datasets. Statistical tests like mean, standard deviation, Kruskal Wallis test, and Tukey’s Post Hoc test are performed on all the nine algorithms to establish their efficiencies. Three cluster validity indices viz., Xie-Beni Index, Object-based Validation with densities, and Correlation Based Cluster Validity Index are used as the fitness function. The F, F’, and Q scores are used to compare the clustered images. The proposed algorithms are found to perform better in most of the cases when compared to their classical counterparts. It is also observed that the qutrit versions of the algorithms are found to converge faster. They also provide the optimal number of clusters almost equivalent to the number of classes identified in the ground-truth image. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial humming bird algorithm; Automatic clustering; Genetic algorithm; Hyperspectral image clustering; Particle swarm optimization; Qubit; Qutrit","Birds; Clustering algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Qubits; Table lookup; Artificial humming bird algorithm; Automatic clustering; Bird's algorithm; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral image clustering; Image clustering; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Qutrits; Swarm optimization; Genetic algorithms","Bhattacharyya, S.; Algebra University CollegeCroatia; email: dr.siddhartha.bhattacharyya@gmail.com",,"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",25244906,,,,"English","Quantum Mach.

In VSPC, the first model predictive control (MPC) is used with a PV array to predict the system state in the horizon of time and to eliminate the voltage sensor. An adaptive concept is used for deciding the operating point, which accelerates the tracking process and improves dynamic performance during irradiation changes and shading pattern changes in partially shaded conditions. Moreover, VSPC also takes care of the EV charging process using the EV -provided battery management system (BMS) command or threshold safety limits of the EV battery. The working principle of VSPC is based on a prediction of the future behavior of the system. It realizes on a selected time horizon, in an arbitrary number of samples, which is decided according to the complexity of the fitness function. In order to minimize or maximize the fitness function, it predicts the voltage of the solar PV array as well as tunes the present control signal, which forces it to converge or reach the convergence criteria. Moreover, the cost and response time of current sensors are lower than voltage sensors. Therefore, the VSPC control gives a fast response and low power oscillations in steady-state compared to conventional techniques. This control technique is verified on a developed prototype of the PV system in different shading and irradiance conditions, as well as the system stability, is analyzed through the Bode plot.

Owing to the fact that double-line frequency ripple power is produced in ac-dc conversion, active power decoupling (APD) circuit enables the use of long-life film capacitors by providing an alternate path to dc-side ripple power. With the objective to perform decoupling operation under nonideal grid conditions without sensing the decoupling capacitor voltage, this article presents a voltage sensorless modulated model predictive control (VS-MMPC) approach for APD circuit. With the ease-of-implementation and provision to approach high-switching frequency, in presented MMPC scheme a voltage vector is formulated to directly track the ripple power. By reconstructing the dynamic model based on Euler's approximation, the decoupling voltage senseless operation is achieved. A comparative study with the state-of-the-art decoupling control under nonideal grid conditions shows that the presented control offers improved dynamic performance with reduced execution time. In addition, a detailed stability analysis based on the Lyapunov theorem and pole-assessment criterion, is also discussed in this article.

To maintain an uninterrupted operation, accurate fault diagnosis system of IM is required. It can help to improve operational safety and prevent unexpected economic losses. The traditional diagnosis methods are less capable of dealing with real-time and varying working environments. This paper presents a vibro-acoustic fusion technique for an accurate fault diagnosis under varying working conditions. The suggested method fuses the features of vibration and acoustic signals using Multi Input-Convolutional Neural Network (MI-CNN) technique. At first, raw vibration and acoustic signals are acquired at varying speeds and converted into a time–frequency spectrum using the Constant Q-Non-Stationary Gabor Transform (CQ-NSGT). Thereafter, a MI-CNN-based vibro-acoustic fusion is adopted for the fusion of vibration and acoustic features. Six distinct motor conditions are utilized to compute the effectiveness of the suggested MI-CNN model. Further, two additional datasets, i.e., bearing and the gearbox datasets, are employed to validate the suggested approach.

Reliable and secure operations of such a system under a large signal disturbance necessitate an anomaly diagnosis scheme, which is substantial for either selective operation of relays (during grid faults) or cybersecurity (during cyber-attacks). This becomes a challenge for power electronic systems, as their characteristic response to such large-signal disturbances is very fast. Hence, we accumulate our efforts in this article to characterize them accurately within a short time frame. A novel noninvasive anomaly diagnosis mechanism for IBRs is presented, which only requires locally measured voltage and frequency as inputs. Mapping these inputs in a XY -plane, the characterization process is able to classify between the anomalies within 5 ms. To the best of our knowledge, this mechanism provides the fastest decision in comparison to the existing techniques, which also assists the equipped protection/cybersecurity technology to take corresponding decisions without enforcing any customization. The proposed scheme is validated on many systems using real-time (RT) simulations in OPAL-RT environment with HYPERSIM software and also on a hardware prototype.

The analytical approach utilizes the nonlinear quasi-static dynamics of the phase-locked loop (PLL) for obtaining the reduced-order models (ROM) of multiple heterogeneous grid-feeding converters having same and different point of synchronization (POS). This is a significant contribution in contrast to the prior effort where reduced-order modeling has been carried out only for homogeneous grid-tied multi-converter systems. In addition to this, an innovative methodology has been proposed in this article for analyzing the transient synchronization stability of the multi-converter systems leveraging the Lyapunov's direct method. The Lyapunov functions are constructively synthesized by invoking an assumption that the reduced-order models are conservative in nature. Following this, the well-known Lyapunov's second theorem is applied for deriving the sufficient conditions required for obtaining the transient stability boundary of the heterogeneous grid-feeding converter systems. Numerical simulations are performed in MATLAB 2017a platform to demonstrate that the ROM are highly accurate and computationally efficient. Besides, the efficacy of the proposed methodology for analyzing the transient synchronization stability of heterogeneous grid-feeding multi-converter systems is verified numerically. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","grid faults; Grid-tied inverters; phase-locked loop; reduced-order modeling; transient synchronization stability","Electric inverters; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Feeding; Locks (fasteners); Lyapunov functions; MATLAB; Phase locked loops; Simulation platform; Synchronization; Grid fault; Grid-tied inverter; Multi-converter systems; Power conversion; Power system dynamics; Power systems stability; Reduced order modelling; Reduced-order model; Synchronization stability; Transient synchronization stability; Transient analysis","Pal, D.; Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India; email: diptak.pal@ee.iitd.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",08858977,,ITPDE,,"English","IEEE Trans Power Delivery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137868620

The electric motor is the heart of every EV and is the key to realizing the optimum balance of top speed, acceleration, deceleration, and achievable distance per charge. In such conditions, the continuous monitoring of EV motors demands efficient methods to avoid catastrophic and vital loss. This paper proposed a multi-sensor-based approach for bearing fault diagnosis of an electric vehicle motor, i.e., a Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM), under constant and varying speed conditions. Initially, raw acoustic and vibration data are acquired at constant and varying speed conditions and decomposed by the Hilbert transform, followed by feature extraction. Thereafter, a Bayesian optimized Neural Network (BoNN) has been proposed for evaluating the performance of individual sensors using five bearing conditions of the SRM.

The health condition of the bearing directly affects the safe operation of the rotating machine and also inhibits the catastrophic loss to other components. To receive high-quality goods and services from these machines, their proper functioning requires intelligent and effective bearing diagnosis. Sound signal heard by a human is an important indicator of the faults in various components of the bearing. In the present work, a Head and Torso Simulator (HATS) has been used to capture the sound signal data from various conditions of fault in the bearing to mimic the natural hearing of human beings. After that, the acquired sound signal data was processed to get the Mel spectrogram of different bearing conditions and then put as input to a designed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the intelligent diagnosis. The accuracy range of 97.11 % - 99.93 % is obtained in the case of left ear data, and this range for right ear data is 97.43 % - 99.97 %.

Moreover, these vehicles, especially two-wheelers, becoming an integrated part of the present transport system, and their safe operation must be considered for a successful run under practical operating conditions. In the present work, a two-wheeler EV simulator is designed and developed to perform experimental simulations on different pragmatic operating conditions at the laboratory level. Moreover, a convolutional neural network (CNN) steered with wavelet synchrosqueezing transform (WSST)-based scalograms is proposed for fault identification in an electric two-wheeler. First, raw vibration signatures are acquired from the in-wheel brushless direct current (BLDC) hub motor and the mid-drive switched reluctance motor (SRM). Thereafter, these signatures are decomposed and transformed into time-frequency representation using WSST. Then, a CNN model is used for further identification and classification of the various bearing defects in EV motors. The experimental findings showed that the suggested method could successfully diagnose the various bearing faults under the mentioned working conditions. In both the in-wheel BLDC hub motor and the mid-drive SRM, the maximum achieved classification accuracies are 97.14% and 97.78%, respectively, in the case of the full-speed condition.

We propose a novel two-fold method with a prime focus on self-adaptive prior named Weighted Median Channel Prior (WMCP) to resolve the problems introduced by using a fixed size local-patch in the dehazing process. WMCP works by leveraging the spatially changing haze statistics such as inclusion–exclusion of related pixels for estimating depth-map in varying haze conditions. It is a scale-invariant technique that retains most of the information present in the local neighbourhood of the hazy input image for estimating scene depth, which traditional methods generally fail to preserve. In addition, an unsharp-masking based technique called edge-modulation (EM) promotes hidden or missing details such as microscopic edges and textures lost due to haze, making this scheme beneficial in ensuring a visually aesthetic and realistic dehazed image. This research also includes a set of ablation tests to assess the contributions of each module engaged in the dehazing process. We performed a comparative evaluation of our method with several state-of-the-art techniques, revealing its superiority in terms of visibility improvement and edge preservation, especially when the dense haze regions are taken into consideration. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Image dehazing; Image enhancement; Image restoration","Demulsification; Image enhancement; Restoration; Textures; Visibility; Condition; Dehazing; Fixed size; Image dehazing; Inclusion-exclusion; Performance; Prime-focus; Single image dehazing; Single images; Weighted median; Image reconstruction","Gautam, S.; Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India; email: sidharthgautam02@gmail.com",,"Academic Press Inc.",10773142,,CVIUF,,"English","Comput Vision Image Understanding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85147995355

When the supply voltage drops more than 10%, the solar PV system remains connected and continues to supply the active power to the loads as well as to the grid. Along with the active power supply, the solar PV array system supplies the reactive power for stabilising the system. Due to the supply of both the active and reactive powers, there is a chance for a grid fed inverter (GFI) current to exceed the maximum current limit. It may result in the tripping of inverter protection. Therefore, a current limiting logic is incorporated to keep the inverter current within the safe limit. The unbalanced voltages are responsible for circulation of negative sequence currents in the system. As the prime aim of the present work deals with the supply of positive sequence currents to the grid, it is required to estimate the positive and negative sequence voltages separately. Intending the estimation of sequence voltages from unbalanced supply voltages, a frequency adaptive higher order complex filter (FAHOCF) is used. A MATLAB model of grid interactive solar PV array is developed and simulated results are verified with test results. © 2022 The Authors.

However, the DNNs' architectural configuration has a significant impact on their performance, and the selection of proper hyper-parameters determines the success or failure of these models. Therefore, one of the challenging issues in DNNs is how to assess their hyper-parameter values effectively. Most of the previous researches in the literature have tuned the DNNs' hyper-parameters manually, which is a weak and time-consuming task. Using optimization/evolutionary algorithms is an effective way to obtain the optimal values of DNNs' hyper-parameters automatically. In this article, we propose a novel evolutionary algorithm that is based on the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) improved by adding two evolutionary operators, opposition-based learning and chaos theory, to the optimization process. Overall, a novel probabilistic wind power forecasting model named neural GOA deep auto-regressive (NGOA-DeepAr) is proposed based on an auto-regressive recurrent neural network in which the proposed evolutionary algorithm has optimized its hyper-parameters. The performance of the proposed NGOA-DeepAr model is tested on two different datasets: One is the publicly available GEFCom-2014 dataset and the other is the Australian Energy Market Operator dataset. The prediction interval coverage probability and pinball loss for the two datasets are $[0.902, 0.320]$ and $[0.933, 1.4885]$, respectively. According to the experimental findings, our proposed NGOA-DeepAr is much faster in learning and outperforms the benchmark DNNs and the other neuroevolutionary models. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Deep auto-regressive (DeepAr); modified grasshopper optimization algorithm (MGOA); neuroevolution (NE); probabilistic forecasting; wind power (WP)","Chaos theory; Deep neural networks; Evolutionary algorithms; Parameter estimation; Probabilistic logics; Recurrent neural networks; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Deepar; Hyper-parameter; Modified grasshopper optimization algorithm; Neural-networks; Neuro evolutions; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Predictive models; Probabilistic forecasting; Wind forecasting; Optimization","Arora, P.; Indian Institute of Technology, India; email: parularora@ee.iitd.ac.in",,"IEEE Computer Society",15513203,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Wide area measurement system (WAMS) infrastructure comprising of phasor measurement units (PMUs) has recently shown remarkable progress in solving complex power system problems and avoiding blackouts. However, WAMS is vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper presents a novel cyber-attack resilient WAMS framework incorporating both attack detection and mitigation modules that ensure the resiliency of PMU data-based supervisory protection applications. It includes deep learning-based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model for real-time detection of anomalies in time-series PMU measurements and isolating the compromised PMUs followed by Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets (GAIN) for the reconstruction of the compromised PMU’s data. The corrected PDC data-stream is then forwarded to the decision-making end application, making it resilient against attacks. A Random Forrest classifier is used in the end application to distinguish fault events from other disturbances and supervise the third zone of distance relay for backup protection of transmission lines. The efficacy of the proposed framework for different attack scenarios has been verified on the WSCC 9-Bus System modeled on a developed real-time digital simulator (RTDS)-based integrated cyber-physical WAMS testbed. Experimental analysis shows that the proposed model successfully detects and mitigates attacks’ adverse effects on the end application. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Cyber-security; Detection; Generative adversarial imputation nets (GAIN); Long-short term memory (LSTM); Mitigation; Phasor measurement units (PMU); Smart grid; Supervision of backup relays","Brain; Computer crime; Crime; Cyber attacks; Decision making; Electric lines; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Network security; Phase measurement; Phasor measurement units; Smart power grids; Wide area networks; Backup relays; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Detection; Generative adversarial imputation net; Long-short term memory; Mitigation; Phasor measurement unit; Smart grid; Supervision of backup relay; Long short-term memory","Chawla, A.; Electrical Engineering Department, India; email: astha.chawla@ee.iitd.ac.in",,"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",09410643,,,,"English","Neural Comput.

Moreover, this developed PCHC algorithm is integrated with a novel reduced sensor-based approach, where only a single current sensor is used to complete the solar-powered battery charging process. The ease of implementation with a simple controller and reduced sensor approach makes it economical for residential rooftop SPV. In the proposed PCHC methodology, two consecutive points on the Power-Voltage (P-V) characteristic of PV are used to detect the Maximum point region quickly. Moreover, the parabolic nature of the P-V characteristic near the Maximum Power Point (MPP) zone is explored to calculate the approx value of voltage corresponding to the optimum power. Here in every iteration, the size of the perturbation in duty is reduced by fifty percent. It overcomes the trade-off between tracking speed and oscillations near the MPP of conventional MPPT techniques such as perturb and observe, incremental conductance. These oscillations affect the connected consumers' load working efficiency and lifetime. Moreover, it also improves the dynamic performance by taking different step sizes for sudden and slow changes in irradiation levels. The boost converter has been used to realize the performance of the proposed PCHC MPPT technique.

However, there are many applications where the output voltage is regulated to be at a lower level than that of the input. Utilizing normal two stage configurations put a severe stress on the DC link capacitor. Therefore, a unique two stage configuration is presented consisting of a switched capacitor cell inherently capable of providing a low gain for the voltage, which is then again stepped down in a second stage for other applications requiring even lower voltage. This ensures the stress on the DC link remains within a nominal range. The converter works in continuous current mode (CCM) and an overall control complexity is less.

Moreover, the phase angle and frequency estimation loops in PLLs are not decoupled, which leads to inaccurate phase and frequency estimations during amplitude fluctuations in the grid voltage. Moreover, connection of highly reactive loads at the point of common coupling leads to spurious transients in phase angle, which again affects estimated frequency with sudden overshoots. Moreover, connected loads also demean system power quality indices (PQI). Hence, there is a need to decouple voltage-phase angle and frequency estimation loops to minimize the effect of transients in one parameter over the other. Moreover, to adhere to the grid codes, there is a necessity to improve PQI by eliminating dominant harmonics. Hence, this work considers a solar photovoltaic array (SPVA) based grid-tied microgrid with a battery energy storage (BES) connected at the DC link.

The incentivized tariff also depends on seasonal generation and demand profiles. The economic operation of the microgrid largely depends on the coherency between the power utilization profile with the seasonal time of use (ToU) tariff. Moreover, the microgrid operators may also be penalized for drawing nonlinear and highly reactive currents from the grids. Therefore, in this work, a complete power regulation strategy is developed to enable the overall energy consumption profile analogous to the seasonal ToU tariff profile keeping battery constraints and overloading protection into consideration. The system under consideration comprises of a grid-tied, two-stage solar photovoltaic (PV) array and a battery to ensure the required degree of freedom for power levelling. To prevent the reflection of the harmonics of the load currents, a non-identical higher order cascaded generalized integrator (NIHOC-GI) type filter is used to linearize the grid currents, even during weak grid and distorted load conditions. A frequency locked loop (FLL) is used to make the NIHOC-GI adaptive to the varying grid frequency. An optimization technique is also presented to select the optimal battery energy storage (BES) size for a given/ selected PV array size.

To rectify this issue of DLFR, bulky high-valued electrolytic DC-link capacitors are employed in each CHB module. An alternate solution is to use an active power decoupling (APD) circuit at DC-link of each sub-module. However, using APD circuit in each CHB module results in increased system complexity and switch-count. In this context, this paper proposes an integrated-isolated DC-DC (IID) converter, which acts a secondary-stage for the CHB converter and performs APD operation, while maintaining desired output power without using additional switches. Each IID converter based conversion-chain connected with CHB module has the ability to transfer DLFR to the decoupling capacitor.

In determining the optimal number of required PMUs, as a practical consideration, PMUs are considered to have limited number of input channels. A weighted least square optimization problem with a continuous relaxation is considered for the discrete binary constraint. A perturbation-robust algorithm is developed for a global optimal solution that achieves optimal PMU placement. The efficacy of the proposed smart grid monitoring instrumentation approach is validated on IEEE 6, 14, 30, 57, and 118-bus systems. The grid perturbations are represented with node weights using a small signal modeling approach. The results demonstrate that, unlike the conventional system observability-aware PMU deployment, the proposed instrumentation strategy ensures system controllability under generic perturbation conditions with a revised PMU placement vector of reduced size in all the test cases. © 2023 IEEE.","Grid controllability; grid monitoring instrumentation; limited input current channels; optimal PMU placement (OPP); perturbation; phasor measurement unit (PMU)",,"Mandal, A.K.; Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665471640,,,"English","IEEE Int.

With existing economics considering levelized cost and payback period, batteries are still an expensive option which makes choice for systems with energy storage a secondary option. Connected local loads may have distortions, which demeans system power quality performance and increase harmonic losses. It also reduces system power transfer capability for a given rating specification. Moreover, the grid voltage abnormalities like sag/ swell, phase angle jump, distorted/ unbalanced voltages and possible frequency fluctuations also degrades performance of grid connected microgrid applications. System performance can be robustified through proper control of grid tied inverter responsible for renewable energy conversion. Sinusoidal fundamental component extraction helps in achieving accurate control action despite persistent load current/ grid voltage irregularities, and thereby improves power quality indices of renewable energy systems. Accurate estimation of frequency and phase angle also enhances harmonic component filtering ability of filters used for generating reference currents to linearize grid currents.

However, manually labelling SCADA data with fault details is tedious and challenging due to the unstructured characteristics of the data. Alarm systems can detect faults but frequently generate more alarms than necessary, resulting in false positives. A novel framework addresses these issues using the turbine alarm system data and a rule-based categorization approach. The framework was tested using data from an operational wind farm, where historical stoppages were precisely tagged using alarm data. The testing used a 10-fold cross-validation approach with a random forest algorithm and bagging, iterating 100 times with a base learner. The investigation showed that the proposed framework obtained a remarkable 95.8% in accurately identifying cases, with only 4.16% misclassified.

The most frequent faults in PV strings are line-to-line (LL) and line-to-ground (LG) faults.

However, these methods do not consider low mismatch faults, high impedance faults, active MPPT control, the effect of blocking diodes, step changes in irradiation levels and partial shading conditions in a single window. In this article, a novel and efficient modified binary genetic algorithm (MBGA) based on the weighted K-nearest neighbor method, which incorporates all the abovementioned constraints, has been proposed to identify and classify faults. In addition, it also gives information about the severity of faults. Unlike other machine learning (ML)-based methods, the developed technique considers features based on both frequency and time domain and employs MBGA to extract the optimal set of features, which further improves the accuracy of the algorithm and reduces the size of the dataset.

Efficient separation of eye-blink artifacts from EEG signal is challenging for mostly two reasons-1) EOG and EEG signals are spectrally overlapped in low frequency zone, 2) uncontaminated regions of EEG signal should remain unaltered after EOG separation for neural leakage suppression. To overcome these two challenges simultaneously, in this work we have estimated the EOG artifacts from contaminated EEG signal, through employing sparse decomposition by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit [OMP] and thresholding of corresponding coefficients. Sine and cosine waveforms of densely spaced different frequencies are utilized as dictionary atoms. OMP representation of small overlapped contaminated EEG segments with relaxed sparsity bound, exhibit a distinct pattern in concatenated coefficient vector. This specific pattern leads to a straightforward thresholding, for unnecessary coefficient rejection.

Furthermore, it is associated with several comorbidities, such as cardiovascular ailments like coronary heart disease and hypertension. Nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) is a clinical diagnostic modality utilized for the diagnosis of OSA. This method is associated with significant costs and discomfort for patients, as it necessitates manual interpretation by trained professionals and is time-consuming. Methods utilizing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for the diagnosis of OSA have been proposed as a means of mitigating associated challenges. Nevertheless, the vast majority of the currently available solutions are based on feature engineering, which requires a large amount of specialized knowledge and skill. The present study introduces an innovative technique for the categorization of OSA through the utilization of a ResNet model on a solitary-lead ECG signal. In order to train and test the proposed model, the PhysioNet Apnea-ECG database was used throughout the process. ReseNet18 and ResNet50 are both deep learning models, and they are used to predict how well the model will perform. For a batch size of 256, after 2, and before 2, the ResNet 18 proved its maximum performance by achieving an accuracy of 89% and a recall of 89%. In addition, the ResNet 50 was able to attain its maximum performance by doing the following: obtaining an accuracy of 89%, a precision of 89%, an F1-score of 89%, and a recall of 89% for the batch size of 512, after 1, and before 1. © 2023 IEEE.","Classification; Deep Learning Model; ECG signal; Obstructive sleep apnea; ResNet18","Biomedical signal processing; Electrocardiograms; Learning systems; Sleep research; Batch sizes; Comorbidities; Deep learning model; Electrocardiogram signal; Learning models; Obstructive sleep apnea; Performance; Resnet18; Respiratory disturbances; Sleep disorders; Deep learning","Kumar, C.B.; Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India; email: cbs.kumar08@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9798350335095,,,"English","Int.

As per the conventional norms of communication engineering, PES still rely on time synchronized sampling, which translates every received message with equal importance. In this paper, we go beyond event-triggered sampling/estimation to integrate semantic principles into the sampling process for each distributed energy resource (DER), which not only compensates for delayed communicated signals by reconstruction of a new signal from the inner control layer dynamics, but also evaluates the reconstruction stage using key semantic requirements, namely Freshness, Relevance and Priority for good dynamic performance. As a result, the sparsity provided by event-driven sampling of internal control loop dynamics translates as semantics in PES. The proposed scheme has been extensively tested and validated on a modified IEEE 37-bus AC distribution system, under many operating conditions and noisy environment in OPAL-RT environment to establish its robustness, model-free design ability and adaptive behavior to dynamic cyber graph topologies.

To mitigate power quality challenges, this work proposes a multiple delayed signal cancellation filter with 15 layers and unit delay factor (MDSC115) for improved power quality of a grid-tied solar power conversion system (SPCS) equipped with a battery energy storage (BES). The control attenuates all integral positive sequence harmonic components from 2nd to 30th harmonics excluding positive sequence 16th harmonic. It also eliminates integral negative sequence harmonic components from 1st to 28th harmonics excluding negative sequence 14th harmonic, including 0 Hz DC component, without the need of additional prefilters cascaded to the filter. A modified frequency locked loop (MFLL) is incorporated to make the MDSC115 adaptive to the varying grid frequency and make it immune to phase angle jump and frequency fluctuations in the grid voltages. The MDSC115-MFLL improves the power quality of SPCS during grid adversities and load current irregularities.

The heterogeneous distribution of EVs has led to distinct standards and hence the EV chargers. Consequently, the work in this chapter discusses different types of EV chargers depending on the charging method, architecture, power level and the type of connector and standard [2]. Additionally, the demonstration of AC and DC charging systems is presented in the real EV testbed. The communication messages exchanged between the EV and EV charger in a charging session are also presented. To make the adoption of EVs cleaner and greener in true sense, the development of renewable energy-sourced EV (RESEV) charger is the current topic of research [3]. The RESEV might face the challenges due to the intermittent power supply of renewable energy resources. But these can be taken care of either by integrating the energy storage systems (ESSs) to the network, in parallel to the green sources, or by integrating RESEVs to the grid. The initial deployment of RESEV integrated with the grid would be beneficial as it would maintain the continuity of electric supply [4]. Moreover, the continuous increase in penetration of EVs can have adverse impact on efficiency of the electric grid [5]. This can further lead to energy crisis, increase peak demand, transformer overloading, voltage dip, etc. The unmanaged integration of EVs can lead to brownouts or even blackouts in severe cases. To combat these issues, effective trading policy is a prerequisite. As the EV charging infrastructure integrated with the grid is a cyber-physical system, it also poses potential risk of cyber attacks [6]. The cyber intrusions like denial-of-service (DoS) attack, false data injection attacks (FDIAs), replay attacks, etc. by adversaries can result in unforeseen consequences. Therefore, it also mandates the incorporation of cyber attack detection and mitigation algorithms to prevent or battle against such intrusions. Therefore, this work further presents a brief description on the RESEV chargers, impact of EV chargers on the grid and requirement of demand response (DR) for EV integrated grid. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Frequent handoffs (HOs) is a major issue in vehicular communication, causing various concerns such as loading problems in the overlapping area, signalling overhead, and decreasing the bandwidth efficiency of the network. To combat the loading problem due to HO in the overlapping area and the low convergence issues, we propose a game-theoretic approach to resolve the imbalance of resource allocation amongst the edge clusters. The proposed game-based Flexible Resource Allocation (FRA) approach optimally redistributes the resources to all clusters within a base station (BS). We obtain an approximate closed-form expression of the transmit power for a 5G network, besides analyzing the effects of connectivity probability and required resources for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) during HO.

The proposed work aims to automate the process of detection of infection patches with the help of a neural network model, called the COVSeg-Net. The model is trained and validated on a dataset consisting of 2581 CT scan images of volumetric CT scans of 10 patients. The proposed work obtained a Dice coefficient score of 0.783 and a Jaccard index of 0.729 on 381 testing CT scan slices. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.","COVID-19; CT scans; Deep learning; Lung infections; Segmentation","Biological organs; Computerized tomography; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Neural network models; Chest image; Computed tomography scan; Deep learning; Infections disease; Lung infection; Neural network model; Patch segmentation; Radiographic images; Scan images; Segmentation; COVID-19","Ahuja, S.; Electrical Engineering Department, India; email: Sakshi.Ahuja@ee.iitd.ac.in","Borah S.Gandhi T.K.Piuri V.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",23673370,9789819942831,,,"English","Lect.

The involved cost and downtime increase due to this problem, which can be mitigated with proper maintenance planning. This paper proposes a multi-fault diagnosis of two critical rotating components, motor and bearing at a system level. Motor current signatures of all possible muti-fault conditions were acquired at different speeds. The extracted signals were divided into small signal segments by implementing a sliding window with a fixed sample size. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) was then employed on each extracted segment, and different datasets were formed for doing signal, sequence and image classification using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and 2D CNN models, respectively. A comparative analysis of model performance was performed and found that 2D CNN outperformed other machine learning models.

In mobile charging service, the mobile charging stations (MCS) charge EV charging requests at their preferred place and time. The EV owner chooses the location she needs her vehicle to be charged from a mobile and desktop application. The benefits of this type of charging scheme can only be reaped if multiple EV charging requests are serviced by each MCS. However, the EV charging requests can be spatially and temporally random and thus make it challenging to assign multiple requests to each mobile charging station. In order to control the EV charging requests, we present the dynamic pricing mechanism where the charging service operator presents a menu of prices for different demands and deadlines for each EV request. Depending on the utility, the EV owner may choose an option from the menu or reject all. Furthermore, we show that the number of MCS and the cost of charging reduce substantially in the proposed pricing scheme. © 2023 IEEE.","charging; deadline-scheduling; electric-vehicle; mobile charging station; optimization; smart grid","Charging (batteries); Costs; Smart power grids; Charging; Charging station; Deadline scheduling; Dynamic pricing; Electric vehicle charging; EV Charging; Mobile charging; Mobile charging station; Optimisations; Smart grid; Electric vehicles",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9798350319972,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Unlike conventional generators, where the generation can be efficiently and more accurately predicted, intermittent generators cannot engage in the electricity market because of their otherwise nature. Virtual-Power-Plants use EV battery storage to reduce the need to invest in dedicated storage while enhancing its profit by scheduling the energy supply to the grid. However, the stochasticity in wind energy generation, changing EV storage availability, and varying market prices are critical concerns of VPP operators. To account for this issue, we formulate the optimization problem for maximizing the profit of renewable energy generators as a Stochastic Receding Horizon convex optimization problem. Furthermore, we introduce a novel scheme of energy credits for EV owners in exchange for using their battery storage. The convex formulation guarantees the optimal solution of the optimization problem if feasible in real-time. Thus, despite the concerns, the VPP can participate in real-time and day-ahead markets and make huge profits. Furthermore, we consider a real-world case study to demonstrate the practicality of our strategy and show that the proposed VPP scheme vividly increases the profit of renewable energy generators. © 2023 IEEE.","Electric Vehicles (EV); Receding Horizon Control; Renewable Energy Sources (RES); Stochastic Optimization; Virtual Power Plants (VPP)","Battery storage; Convex optimization; Electric machine control; Electric vehicles; Investments; Power markets; Profitability; Secondary batteries; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Electric vehicle; Electric vehicle batteries; Receding horizon control; Renewable energy generators; Renewable energy source; Stochastic optimizations; Stochastics; Virtual power plant; Virtual power plants; Virtual Power Plants",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9798350319972,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The DC link voltage stability is vulnerable to power oscillations caused by step load changes (CC mode) at CS by connecting and unplugging EV and intermittent renewable power. An inertia and damping control is proposed in this paper based on the physical model of a virtual DC machine (VDCM) for a DC microgrid (MG) formed for CS. The proposed control technique was developed using the capacitors&#x2019; conversion forms for charging and discharging as the generation and motoring mode of VDCM. It intends to regulate the exterior characteristics of converters connected to the battery energy storage system (BESS) to enhance the damping and inertia properties of the DC grid. The small-signal model of the presented control method is built to analyze the system dynamics response, stability, and parameter range of VDCM. Further, decentralized power-sharing control is also tested for the multiple parallel operations of storage, PV, and CS extension. The simulation results demonstrate that BESS with VDCM control enhances the voltage characteristics and stability of DCMG with or without the grid. Finally, the proposed system is validated through detailed experimental studies.

Vibration signatures were acquired from the different experimental multi-fault conditions under an uncertain operating environment. STFNet (Segmented Time-frequency Network) was applied to extract fault information and to create an intelligent multi-fault classification model. Results and validation: Rigorous testing of the proposed STFNet model was done under various uncertain speed conditions like constant, continuously accelerated, continuously decelerated and fluctuating speed, and a maximum accuracy of 97.87 % was achieved. The performance of the proposed model was compared with the existing algorithms and was validated on another bearing multi-fault dataset.

Ground truth images are also scarcely available. Hence, automatic cluster detection in hyperspectral images is a tough task. Qubit and qutrit versions of the Reptile Search Algorithm are proposed to automatically cluster hyperspectral images. Since the Reptile Search Algorithm contains too many parameters, the number of parameters is reduced in the modified algorithm along with a balancing factor between the exploration and exploitation phases. A new cluster validity index called the Correlation-Based Cluster Validity Index is employed as the fitness function. The quantum versions produce better-optimized results and prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in local optima. The results of the proposed algorithms are compared with the classical Reptile Search algorithm and the modified Reptile Search algorithm.

Two different methodologies, Fault Current Contribution Ratio (FCCR) and Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) are used to implement the proposed technique. First, the FCCR between the healthy and faulty phases is estimated in the relay after the occurrence of the transient. In the next stage, exact fault occurrences and clearance instances are detected using the VMD technique. The exact detection of fault clearance time will help reduce the conventional outage time. This will reduce the unwanted burden on the BESS as it can be used adaptively during the fault only. The comparative assessment is done to show the efficacy of the proposed reclosing method. The proposed technique will also help distinguish faults from switching operations. The performance of the proposed method is validated through a modified IEEE 13-bus BESS-based microgrid architecture. The EMTDC/PSCAD software is used for simulation. The algorithms are developed on the MATLAB platform. Real-time test results are also provided for the signals obtained from the Smart Grid Technology Laboratory (SGTL) lab setup.

It could be a potential resource to supply the frequency regulation services to operate the power system smoothly. In order to provide high-quality regulation services and maximum revenue from the market, accurate forecasting of the building's electrical consumption and regulation capacity is imperative. Inaccurate forecasting of regulation capacity has two major disadvantages, first, the performance score could be poor, and second, the building's thermal discomfort may rise. As the DCS has a complex thermodynamics model and cooling power demand, the forecasting of regulation capacity becomes more stochastic. This paper addresses the above challenges and proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based regulation capacity strategy. To maximize the revenue, two agents are considered, one represents the DCS and the second vehicle-to-grid facility in the building cluster. First, a combined revenue-earned model for building clusters has been developed on the basis of its performance score and regulating capacity. Second, a markov decision process (MDP) has been formulated to offer a strategy for regulation capacity. On the basis of the above formulation, a deep-determined-policy-gradient method has been executed to evaluate the strategy in MDP, which gives us optimum results. As a result, various case study has been done, which shows the revenue earned by the system in different situation. © 2023 IEEE.","Deep Reinforcement Learning; District Cooling System; Frequency Regulation; Vehicle to Grid","Buildings; Cooling; Deep learning; Forecasting; Gradient methods; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Meteorology; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Thermoelectric equipment; Cooling power; Deep reinforcement learning; District cooling system; Frequency regulations; Markov Decision Processes; Performance; Potential resources; Regulation capacity; Reinforcement learnings; Vehicle to grids; Reinforcement learning",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9798350310665,,,"English","Int.

The proposed diagnostic method introduces and analyses various possible mechanical and electrical faults in the IM. The validation of the proposed method is presented with three different modalities, including vibration, acoustic, and infrared thermography, with their comparative performance analysis. Vibration and acoustic-based detection are done with time-frequency scalograms using Constant Q Transform (CQT), which provides enhanced time resolution for lower and higher frequencies.

In this paper, a grid-interfaced dual stage electric vehicle (EV) charger with galvanic isolation, power flow application and improved power quality is presented. To effectively control the traction battery voltage and provide the necessary charging current, traction batteries to have an isolated DC/DC converter in series and an AC/DC single phase VSC (Voltage Source Converter) for Power Factor Correction (PFC) in front-end. This electric vehicle charging system distributes their energy to the grid at times of high demand and recharges their batteries during low peak hours. For ACDC conversion, a four-leg VSC built on a (MOSFET) for linked loads, satisfies the requirements for an active shunt compensator at the (PCC) point of common coupling. Soft voltage or soft current switching is compatible in resonant converters as well as reduces phase difference of given current and voltage, which decreases reactive power in system. But a small ZVS, and significant switch off losses are the results of standard conventional converters. LLC converters are capable of high input voltage operation due to resonant switching and improves overall performance. The first harmonic approximation (FHA) tool is used for governing performance and specifying circuit parameters for designing the LLC converter. A unique LLC-type DC-DC resonant converter with enhanced capabilities of wide range ZVS, G2V, V2G voltage gain, and power flow regulation is examined.

This microgrid (MG) uses a single VSI (Voltage Source Inverter) with reduced power converters and switches. At the DC bus of VSI, a battery bank is used to provide load leveling either at less renewable generation or at light loads. The control of VSI is also able to maintain power balance among various units and provides PQ (Power Quality) improvement in the MG under local nonlinear loads. During no renewable power generation, it works as a DSTATCOM to improve PQ and provides power factor correction and reduces voltage harmonics in PCC (Common Coupling Point) under local linear/nonlinear loads.

It is a strongly underdiagnosed problem because the person suffering from this disease is not aware of this situation. It may cause serious health issues and badly affect the quality of life. Therefore, the diagnosis of sleep is crucial to cure disease. Polysomnography (PSG) is a golden technique for diagnosing sleep disorders. In this technique, multiple sensors are used to collect specific physiological signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), electrooculogram (EOG), and many more. In regular clinical practice, medical experts need to manually analyze the signals of sleep hours which is a tedious process. Therefore, the automatic diagnosis tool is needed to simplify this process. Recently, many research groups have proposed deep learning models for the automatic diagnosis of SA using physiological signals with good accuracy. However, all these models require a large amount of annotated data in the supervised training process, which limits the use of those models in real-time scenarios. However, annotating a huge amount of biomedical signals is challenging and requires lots of time and domain expertise. This study proposes a self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) method for detecting hypopnea events from single-channel electrocardiography (ECG) signals. The proposed model is trained in two phases. In the first training phase, an encoder is trained to learn signal representation from the unlabeled data. In the second training phase, the classifier and the encoder are fine-tuned for the classification. Our proposed model performed well on the test dataset with a per-segment classification accuracy of 85%, 89%, and 92% using only 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data with labels, respectively, for fine-tuning encoder along with the classifier. Also, our proposed model can identify a person suffering from the obstructive SA (OSA) with the accuracy of 100%, even when the encoder and classifier are fine-tuned using only 1% of the training data with the label. The proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art techniques and can be implemented offline or online for rapid and accurate diagnosis of the problem. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","1-D convolutional neural network (CNN); apnea-hypopnea index (AHI); contrastive learning; obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); self-supervised learning; sleep apnea (SA)","Biomedical signal processing; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Physiological models; Signal encoding; Sleep research; Statistical tests; Supervised learning; Contrastive learning; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Hypopnea-index(AHI); Obstructive sleep apnea; One-dimensional; One-dimensional convolutional neural network; Representation learning; Self-supervised learning; Sleep apnea; Electrocardiography","Gandhi, T.K.; Indian Institute of Technology, India; email: tgandhi@iitd.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00189456,,IEIMA,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Automatic clustering of such images is a difficult task. Two algorithms viz., Qubit Evolutionary Butterfly Optimization algorithm and Qutrit Evolutionary Butterfly Optimization algorithm, are proposed for the automatic clustering of hyperspectral images. Implementing quantum mutation operators enhances the exploration phase and prevents it from getting stuck in local optima, a drawback of their classical version. This is the first time quantum versions of the Butterfly Optimization Algorithm are proposed and implemented on such a large dataset. The two proposed algorithms are compared to the classical Butterfly Optimization Algorithm and classical Evolutionary Butterfly Optimization Algorithms, and applied to the Xuzhou HYSPEX dataset. Statistical tests like mean, standard deviation, One-Way ANOVA test, and Tukey’s Post Hoc test are performed on all the algorithms to examine their efficiency. The Correlation Based Cluster Validity Index is used as the fitness function. The quality of clustering is determined using the F, F’, and Q scores. The qutrit version is found to produce more optimal results, followed by the qubit version. The qutrit version converges faster with better optimal results by using a smaller population compared to the other three algorithms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Hyperspectral image automatic clustering; Quantum mutation operator; Qubit Evolutionary Butterfly Optimization; Qutrit Evolutionary Butterfly Optimization","Clustering algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms; Large dataset; Qubits; Automatic clustering; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral image automatic clustering; Mutation operators; Optimisations; Quantum mutation operator; Qubit evolutionary butterfly optimization; Qutrit evolutionary butterfly optimization; Qutrits; Optimization","Dutta, T.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India; email: munai.tulika@gmail.com",,"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",23674512,,,,"English","Lecture.

It is capable of providing smooth transition during grid synchronization or isolation operation and effectively maintains both power balance and power quality. It resolves power quality issues i.e. voltage and current harmonics, reactive power compensation, voltage regulation etc. during steady state operations of standalone and grid tied modes. Control methods are implemented with simplicity and accuracy in voltage control and current control modes. Dual stage wind power boosting is done using a perturbation and observation technique through a boost converter. Single VSI performs backup operation and grid synchronization with reduced control complexity. It provides power quality solutions and during poor wind works like DSTATCOM.

However, load monitoring in smart building environments is challenging due to high variability of real-time load and varied load composition. Furthermore, as the volume and dimensionality of smart meter's data increases, accuracy and computational time are key concerning factors. In view of these challenges, this paper proposes an improved NILM technique using multi-head (Mh-Net) convolutional neural network (CNN) under dynamic grid voltage conditions.

The performance of the developed model has been verified on an experimental laboratory setup for multiple appliance sets with varied power consumption levels, under dynamic grid voltages. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed model has been verified on widely used UK-DALE data, and its performance has been compared with existing NILM techniques.

For accurate diagnosis of multiple-faults, machine learning (ML) models need to be trained with the signature of different multiple-faults, which increases the data acquisition time and expense. This paper proposes a self-adaptive vibration signature-based fault diagnostic method for detecting multiple bearing faults using various single-fault vibration signatures. A time-frequency-based hybrid signal processing technique, which involves discrete wavelet transform and Hilbert transform, was adopted for signal decomposition, followed by the implementation of a sliding window-based feature extraction process. Seven optimized metaheuristic algorithms were used to find the best feature sets, which were further used for the training of three ML models. The results show that the proposed methodology has tremendous potential to detect multiple bearing fault conditions in any possible combination using single-fault data.

Recently introduced IEC 61850-90-5 Routable Sample Values (R-SV) have proven promising to communicate timestamped synchrophasors to the control center, fulfilling the purpose. In wide area protection and control schemes, the communication of synchrophasors to the control center is also followed by sending back a supervisory decision signal (based on synchrophasor data) to the physical devices in the field. Development of WAMS testbeds for implementation and assessment of such schemes have often been addressed only from IEEE C37.118 PMU phasors’ perspective alone. This paper presents a comprehensive cyber–physical WAMS testbed capable of real-time communication of synchrophasors using both IEEE C37.118 PMU phasors and IEC 61850-90-5 R-SV. It also facilitates status and feedback signal communication between the control center and substations using IEC 61850-90-5 Routable GOOSE (R-GOOSE). The developed testbed integrates a real-time digital simulator (RTDS), industry-standard hardware devices such as PMUs, Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC), IEDs, Global Positioning System (GPS) synchronization clock, network components, and software components such as IEC 61850 emulator tools.

Qubits or bilevel quantum bits often describe quantum neural network models. In this article, a novel self-supervised shallow learning network model exploiting the sophisticated three-level qutrit-inspired quantum information system, referred to as quantum fully self-supervised neural network (QFS-Net), is presented for automated segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. The QFS-Net model comprises a trinity of a layered structure of qutrits interconnected through parametric Hadamard gates using an eight-connected second-order neighborhood-based topology. The nonlinear transformation of the qutrit states allows the underlying quantum neural network model to encode the quantum states, thereby enabling a faster self-organized counterpropagation of these states between the layers without supervision. The suggested QFS-Net model is tailored and extensively validated on the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) dataset collected from the Nature repository. The experimental results are also compared with state-of-the-art supervised (U-Net and URes-Net architectures) and the self-supervised QIS-Net model and its classical counterpart. Results shed promising segmented outcomes in detecting tumors in terms of dice similarity and accuracy with minimum human intervention and computational resources. The proposed QFS-Net is also investigated on natural gray-scale images from the Berkeley segmentation dataset and yields promising outcomes in segmentation, thereby demonstrating the robustness of the QFS-Net model. © 2012 IEEE.","Magnetic Resonance (MR) image segmentation; QIS-Net; quantum computing; qutrit; U-Net and URes-Net","Image segmentation; Machine learning; Magnetic resonance; Mathematical transformations; Medical imaging; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Qubits; Topology; Tumors; Biological neural networks; Computational modelling; Images segmentations; Magnetic resonance image segmentation; QIS-net; Quantum Computing; Quantum state; Qutrits; U-net and ures-Net; Neural network models; brain; brain tumor; diagnostic imaging; human; image processing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer","Bhattacharyya, S.; CHRIST (Deemed to be University), India; email: dr.siddhartha.bhattacharyya@ieee.org",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",2162237X,,,"33983887","English","IEEE Trans.

Moreover, PLF adequately captures the uncertainty whether that uncertainty is related to load data or the forecasting model. And there are not many PLF models, and those which exist are very complex or difficult to interpret. This paper proposes a novel neuroevolution algorithm for handling the uncertainty associated with load forecasting. In this paper, a new modified evolutionary algorithm is proposed which is used to find the optimal hyperparameters of 1D-Convolutional neural network (CNN). The probabilistic forecasts are produced by minimizing the mean scaled interval score loss function at 50%, 90% and 95% prediction intervals. The proposed neuroevolution algorithm is tested on a global energy forecasting competition (GEFCom-2014) load dataset, and two different experiments are conducted considering load only and one with load and temperature. Strong conclusions are drawn from these experiments. Also, the proposed model is compared with other benchmark models, and it has been shown that it outperforms the other models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Neuroevolution; Optimization; Probabilistic load forecasting","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Electric power plant loads; Forecasting; Deep learning; Load data; Load forecasting; Neuro evolutions; Optimisations; Power system operation and controls; Probabilistic load; Probabilistic load forecasting; Scheduling and dispatches; Uncertainty; Evolutionary algorithms","Catalão, J.P.S.; Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP) and INESC TECPortugal; email: catalao@fe.up.pt",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787796,,EPSRD,,"English","Electr Power Syst Res",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134294185

Some nodules or other pathologies present in the lungs are difficult to visualize on chest X-rays because they are obscured by overlying bone shadows. Segmentation of bone structures and suppressing them assist medical professionals in reliable diagnosis and organ morphometry. But segmentation of bone structures is challenging due to fuzzy boundaries of organs and inconsistent shape and size of organs due to health issues, age, and gender. The existing bone segmentation methods do not report their performance on abnormal chest X-rays, where it is even more critical to segment the bones. This work presents a robust encoder–decoder network for semantic segmentation of bone structures on normal as well as abnormal chest X-rays. The novelty here lies in combining techniques from two existing networks (Deeplabv3+ and U-net) to achieve robust and superior performance. The fully connected layers of the pre-trained ResNet50 network have been replaced by an Atrous spatial pyramid pooling block for improving the quality of the embedding in the encoder module. The decoder module includes four times upsampling blocks to connect both low-level and high-level features information enabling us to retain both the edges and detail information of the objects. At each level, the up-sampled decoder features are concatenated with the encoder features at a similar level and further fine-tuned to refine the segmentation output. We construct a diverse chest X-ray dataset with ground truth binary masks of anterior ribs, posterior ribs, and clavicle bone for experimentation. The dataset includes 100 samples of chest X-rays belonging to healthy and confirmed patients of lung diseases to maintain the diversity and test the robustness of our method. We test our method using multiple standard metrics and experimental results indicate an excellent performance on both normal and abnormal chest X-rays. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bone structures; Chest X-rays; Semantic segmentation","Biological organs; Decoding; Diagnosis; Medical imaging; Semantic Segmentation; Signal encoding; Statistical tests; Bone structure; Chest X-ray; Fuzzy boundary; Health issues; Medical imaging techniques; Medical professionals; Morphometry; Performance; Semantic segmentation; Shape and size; Semantics; adult; Article; bone structure; chronic obstructive lung disease; clavicle; controlled study; deep learning; deep neural network; diagnostic accuracy; embedding; female; human; image processing; image segmentation; interstitial lung disease; lung cancer; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; pleura effusion; radiodiagnosis; rib; sensitivity and specificity; thorax disease; thorax radiography; transfer of learning; image processing; lung disease; procedures; radiography; semantics; X ray; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung Diseases; Radiography; Semantics; X-Rays","Singh, A.; Bharti School of Telecommunication Technology and Management, India; email: Anushikha.Singh@dbst.iitd.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",13865056,,IJMIF,"35870303","English","Int.

The temperature change, overcharging and over-discharging, is playing critical roles in affecting battery life in a significant manner. In this paper, the deep learning-based method is applied for the prognostics of a single Li-ion battery. The proposed design uses a recurrent neural network variant, long–short-term memory. The model’s parameters are optimized through a genetic algorithm-based parameter selector. The method applies to a sequence of data values comprising of the voltage, the charge capacity, the current, and the temperature. The estimation of battery capacity is not only based on the current or defined state of battery, instead, it is generated on the complete data profile.

Battery thermal management system (BTMS) involves techniques to control the battery's thermal behavior by maintaining temperature and temperature uniformity within an optimal range. Air cooling BTMS is frequently used in EVs due to its design simplicity and cost-effectiveness. Only limited works have utilized passive convective heat transfer enhancement strategies for air-cooled BTMS, especially fin-based structures for cylindrical lithium-ion battery packs. Present work introduces a novel design by incorporating the interrupted fins into a conventionally air-cooled BTMS. The proposed design offers superior heat transfer efficiency as well as ease of manufacturing when compared to the existent herringbone fin design used in prior air-cooled BTMS literature. Results indicate that the average temperature of the cells and maximum temperature difference were reduced by 5.646 and 7.958 K, respectively, by incorporating an optimal uniform interrupted fin arrangement. The average temperature of the cells was reduced by 0.479 K when the interrupted fins were added to increase the area, compared to 0.088 K for an equivalent area enhancement in a conventional fin. The uniform interrupted fin improved the temperature uniformity by 5.05%, but the area enhanced conventional fin deteriorated it by 1.59%. The non-uniform interrupted fin arrangement, resulted in an improvement of 4.47%, over uniform interrupted fins, in the battery pack's temperature uniformity. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","air cooling; electric vehicle; fins; interrupted fins; Lithium-ion battery; numerical simulation","Battery Pack; Cooling systems; Cost effectiveness; Electric vehicles; Fins (heat exchange); Heat convection; Ions; Thermal management (electronics); Air cooling; Battery pack; Battery thermal managements; Heat transfer augmentation; Interrupted fin; Numerical simulation; Performance; Temperature uniformity; Thermal behaviours; Thermal management systems; Lithium-ion batteries","Garg, A.; Centre for Automotive Research and Tribology, India; email: akhil@iitd.ac.in",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",0363907X,,IJERD,,"English","Int.

Distributed energy resources employing inverter interfaces need to ride through them to abide by emerging grid codes. The balanced grid operation has been a well-researched topic. However, literature lacks a unified framework to model, analyze, and design controllers for unbalanced interfaces. This work develops a nonlinear time-domain state-space model of inverter interfaced to an unbalanced grid. It includes details of frame transformation, synchronization, inner current controller, and filter dynamics. Its linearization around the steady-state trajectory results in a linear time-periodic (LTP) system. The model is then transformed to the dynamic harmonic domain for ease of analysis, consideration of multiple frequency couplings, and controller design. Precise stability boundaries in parameter space are obtained to understand margins for safe operation intuitively. A stability augmentation using output feedback is presented for increasing these margins. Feedback gain is designed using the generalized Nyquist criterion.

SA is of paramount importance when it comes to accurate sensing of events for better visualization of the power system dynamics. Various events uniquely excite particular states of the power systems resulting in a maximum change in the entropy for certain power system components. A new conceptual framework utilizing structure preserving energy function (SPEF) for identifying the specific component of the energy function and correlating it with the appropriate event has been suggested. Cubature Kalman filter-unknown input based dynamic state estimation technique has been employed for the extraction of states and unknown inputs from the phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements for the derivation of the SPEF-based event indicators. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique, it has been validated on the IEEE 39-bus system and also on actual PMU data obtained from the Indian power grid.

One of the specific issue i.e. control loop interaction of vector-controlled VSC under high grid impedance leads to several instability mechanism ultimately resulting in unwanted tripping of the VSC unit. As a countermeasure, a unique nonlinear adaptive stabilizing control (NASC) technique has been proposed in this paper to enhance the dynamic stability of the VSC during such scenarios. A small-signal model is developed first to examine the instability mechanism of VSC connected to weak grids under abnormal operating conditions and varying set points of the power controller. The dominant modes are identified from the analysis and a stabilizing controller is developed based on adaptive dynamic surface control philosophy for enhancing its stability. The proposed controller has been proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded using Lyapunov analysis. Besides, the stabilizing mechanism of VSC is analyzed with the proposed controller by performing small-signal stability analysis of the entire system.

The proposed model employs complex pattern learning capabilities of recurrent neural networks and temporal pattern extraction of innovation state-space models. It is tested on GEFCom-14 and ISO-NE datasets, one with a single load and multiple loads. Different case studies are conducted to examine the involvement of temperature for load forecasting. It has been observed that in the case of multivariate loads, temperature variable doesn't make much difference in PLF, but in the case of univariate loads, forecasting results are four-times better.

Furthermore, zero voltage turn-on (ZVS) is achieved for dc side switches. Compared with SPSM, DCPSM maintains a constant peak current in the converter throughout the grid cycle of ac mains voltage.

But, the line to ground voltages will be shifted upward, as same as the amount of DC voltages imposed by the battery swapping station which is demanded by the distribution system operator.

The obtained results show the significant enhancement of the power flow capability such as up to 118.3% capacity improvement in the case of 400 V line.

This ALMS control algorithm has some new features: (1) it provides a fast rate of convergence, (2) harmonics mitigation ability, and (3) ease of implementation. The solar PV energy generating system includes a DC–DC boost converter, a voltage source converter (VSC), a ripple filter, a three-phase grid, and local non-linear loads. The VSC is controlled for feeding the active power from the solar array to the grid and three-phase non-linear loads. Moreover, VSC control is used to improve the grid current quality. A DC–DC boost converter is coupled between the photovoltaic array and the DC-link capacitor, which tracks the maximum SPVA power from the SPV array by using perturb & observe algorithm. Here, the main goals of SPVA generating system are to eradicate power quality problems caused by unbalanced and non-linear loads and to provide sinusoidal grid currents at solar PV array irradiance variation. Moreover, a comparison of ALMS control is made with other control algorithms. Performance of this ALMS control is studied at varying non-linear loads and under different environmental conditions on a developed prototype in the laboratory. The simulated results of the system are validated with test results.

To overcome this challenge, a unique hybrid technique has been proposed in this article for the anti-islanding protection of distributed generators (DGs). The algorithm requires the injection of an active oscillatory disturbance signal of very small magnitude through the current control loop along the direct axis of the synchronously rotating reference frame of the converter. Small signal stability analysis of the system is carried out to analyze the effect of such active signal injection having different frequencies. The anti-islanding protection algorithm first involves the superimposition of d-axis voltage. Thereafter, two novel indexes are proposed based on which the trip signal logic is developed for the protection scheme. The methodology has been found to detect an unintentional islanding scenario within 90 ms from the initiation instant.

Design variation in control scheme of off-board chargers in terms of power and voltage makes it difficult to enable ZVS operation of converters. To solve this problem, an active front-end converter fed by a three-phase supply is operated through a d-q vector for the first step of power conversion, based on synchronous reference frame (SRF) simple control scheme. Active front end converter regulates by pulse width modulated (PWM) rectifiers is widely applicable for ac-dc power conversion stage. Detailed circuit architecture for DC-DC stage, with hybrid FBLLC converter uses a control based on voltage gain profile to control voltage and current stress. The rectifier delivers regulated DC supply with reduced harmonics while maintaining current waveform of high quality to achieve near unity power factor. The deviation in DC-DC stage efficiency profile is due to wide variation of power process involve in operation. To fix this issue, PWM controlled boost mode and frequency modulated boost mode operation are considered. It offers economical, highly efficient, compact, reliable, and simple control. The battery terminal voltage of this EV charger varies from 240 V-560 V. This topology and controller are validated using MATLAB simulations. A 6.6 kW maximum power transfer prototype is developed to authenticate the operation with wide bandwidth of battery voltage and variable load conditions. © 2022 IEEE.","active rectifier; PEV charger; power quality; SRC-FBLLC converter; three phase VSC; vector control","Boost converter; Charging (batteries); Electric loads; Electric power factor; Electric rectifiers; Energy transfer; MATLAB; Pulse width modulation; Quality control; Rectifying circuits; Secondary batteries; Active front end converters; Active rectifiers; Control schemes; PEV charger; Simple++; SRC-FBLLC converter; Three phase; Three phase VSC; Three phasis; Vector control; Power quality",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9798350398069,,,"English","IEEE Ind.

Early diagnosis using computer-assisted systems is a crucial step to increase the survival rate. Using histopathological imaging is the only step for early detection. Many pathologists find it difficult processing histopathological images using existing conventional analysis algorithms like Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) since histopathological images have time-lapsed global labels. In this chapter, a deep learning method is proposed to detect global features by utilizing patch features extracted by the feature fusion method. Feature encoding is carried out at 15, 30, 45, and 60s image at acetic acid and original image. Each patch level information is obtained at encoding by transfer learning. This proposed transfer learning fusion method is trained and validated by HERLEV with 560 patient images. The proposed Deep Convolution Neural Network produces an accuracy of 0.974 compared to methods in service.

Transfer learning-based approach is adopted to facilitate the faster prediction in case of limited dataset availability.

This work focuses on the cooling power loss minimization in the chilled water pipe network along with the minimum cost of the water pipe and supply water pump. It forecast the peak cooling power requirement of a day for the different types of buildings by using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The network is trained with the previous record of the building's peak cooling power requirement pattern. The forecasted load decides the building to be a seller or buyer node on the basis of the cooling plant capacity installed at the location. An optimum water piping network layout between the seller and buyer node is obtained by following the Grey Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. As a result, a different case study has been done which shows the impact of load forecasting to decide the number and length of pipes in the water distribution network.

As a result, utilities witness fluctuating load profiles with higher peak and average loads. This adversely affects distribution network assets such as transformers, leading to lifetime deterioration and early replacement requirements before end of their rated operating life. Decentralized control of loads, RES and energy storage at user-end has the potential to effectively mitigate uncertainties arising in residential buildings. Accordingly, this paper aims to develop an optimal home energy management systems (HEMS) to coordinate optimal dispatch of multiple resources, through effective handling of real-time fluctuations in RES output and load, thus, ensuring deterministic load profiles at the distribution transformers. The proposed HEMS has been developed as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model which minimizes residential consumption of grid electricity while maximizing user-preferences through optimal dispatch and priority-based disaggregated load control. A mathematical formulation for appliance priority index has been developed to facilitate comfort-constraint HEMS. For quantification of impact-evaluation of proposed scheme on user satisfaction and grid-reliability, two performance indices have been developed. Results demonstrate effectiveness of proposed HEMS in mitigating uncertainties, while managing asset utilization to improve operational life and minimize losses. © 2022 IEEE.","Demand side management; home energy management system; loss reduction; transformer utilization","Decentralized control; Demand side management; Deterioration; Electric energy storage; Electric load dispatching; Energy management; Energy management systems; Housing; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Real time systems; Renewable energy resources; Storage management; Active distributions; Decentralised; Home energy management systems; Home energy managements; Load profiles; Loss reduction; Optimal dispatch; Renewable energy source; Transformer utilization; Uncertainty; Electric power distribution","Sharma, S.; University of Calgary, Canada",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665462020,,,"English","Natl.

In this work, a control method for improving bidirectional charging performance is proposed in which, hybrid modulation of bridgeless interleaved totem pole power factor correction (PFC) combining series resonant converter with reduced frequency-range control is used. For extraction of grid angle a frequency-fixed second order generalized integrator (FF-SOGI) based phase locked loop (PLL) is used. The controller is designed to lower Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI), switching and conduction losses. Symmetrical gating used in secondary side of series resonant converter at backend helps to reduce higher average current and uneven thermal stress on secondary side switches in place of asymmetrical gating. The control mode selection depends upon secondary side output voltage. The reduced switching frequency is achieved by tracing output voltage using two control methods i.e., phase shift control and variable frequency control. The control of the primary switches is achieved through variable- frequency control whereas secondary side switch rectifiers are controlled through phase shift control.

However, the underlying communication infrastucture makes the system highly susceptible to cyber attacks. These attacks in DC microgrids cause severe impact, that can be easily misinterpreted as faults, which can then maloperate the protection decision. Although various protection schemes have been established, a tailor-made scheme to distinguish faults from cyber attacks is needed to ensure reliability of supply. In this paper, we use a two dimensional plane with deviation of current (δI) and voltage (δV ) at the terminal of each converter to distinguish between cyber attacks and faults in DC microgrids. As this scheme is governed based on physics of secondary controller operation, it is simple to implement and scalable to any physical topology. The performance of the proposed scheme is tested with real time simulation in OPAL-RT environment with HYPERSIM software for different topologies including radial, ring and mesh networks. In addition, the scheme is also tested and verified for simultaneous cyber attack on multiple converters.

For buck mode region, the converter is operated with frequency modulation while for boost region, it is operated with PWM control. This sagacious selection of modes, provides very limited current stress for development of portable EV charger. The mode selection is based on secondary side referred voltage and real time sensed voltage of battery. This paper presents the design of portable EV charger with battery terminal voltage varying from 42 V-300 V. The front-end stage is designed with single phase interleaved totem pole converter and secondary stage is designed with hybrid FBLLC converter. The weak and strong grid compatibility of designed charger is made with the design of frequency fixed second order generalised integrator (FFSOGI) based synchronous reference frame (SRF) based phase locked loop (PLL). A 3.3 kW maximum power transfer capacity charger is designed and simulated to validate the effectiveness of the designed EV charger. © 2022 IEEE.","Frequency and PWM modulation; Hybrid FBLLC; Interleaved totem pole VSC; Power quality","Boost converter; Charging (batteries); Efficiency; Energy transfer; Frequency modulation; Poles; Secondary batteries; Frequency and PWM modulation; Hybrid FBLLC; Hybrid modulation; Interleaved totem pole VSC; Modulation techniques; Over charging; Over-complete; Power processing; Real-time detection; Terminal voltages; Pulse width modulation",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665493659,,,"English","IEEE Glob.

High voltage ripple at DC-link due to reduced capacitance, results in poor input power quality and high double-line frequency ripple at the output of secondary-stage. In state-of-art, input power quality in converters with low DC-link capacitance is enhanced by using a digital low-pass filter (LPF). However, employing LPF to sensed DC-link voltage results in non-optimum dynamic response and deteriorated stability margins. With the objective to improve input power quality and to enhance dynamic performance with low valued DC-link capacitance, a modified unit-template based model predictive control (MUT-MPC) is implemented for primary AC-DC converter. The current feed-forward for the unit-template is controlled by predictive voltage error through an optimization process of cost function. Furthermore, a DC-link feedforward (DFF) control is implemented for secondary DC-DC stage, which reduces the low-frequency current ripple at the load. The effectiveness of the presented controls are verified by simulation and experimental results. © 2022 IEEE.","DC-link Feedforward (DFF) Control; Model Predictive Control (MPC); Modified Unit Template; Power Quality; Two-stage AC-DC Converter","Capacitance; Cost functions; Electric lines; HVDC power transmission; Low pass filters; Power quality; Predictive control systems; Rectifying circuits; DC converter; Dc-link; DC-link capacitance; DC-link feedforward control; Input power; Model predictive control; Model-predictive control; Modified unit template; Single phasis; Two-stage AC-DC converter; Model predictive control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665493659,,,"English","IEEE Glob.

The rapid advancement of solar technology and the corresponding cost reduction have allowed it to incorporate solar photovoltaic (SPV) systems into maritime vessels. The intermittent nature of SPV necessitates using an energy storage system (ESS). ESS, such as a battery, is more effective as it caters to high energy density fluctuations. Local nonlinear loads, such as radars, and sonars, cause power quality to deteriorate. Because of this, an enhanced fractional least mean square (EFLMS) controller is utilized to enhance the power quality of the shipboard microgrid.

Fault diagnosis of IM is one of the primary issues that seeks to make sound maintenance decisions to preserve a system's integrity and safety while reducing unplanned downtime and lowering maintenance costs. Most fault diagnosis approaches for IMs are based on analyzing vibration signals captured at constant rotating conditions. Those vibration signal-based methods are less capable at under-speed varying conditions. This paper proposed a Passive Thermal Imaging (PTI) based fault diagnosis approach for IM at varying speed conditions to deal with these issues. Firstly, various thermal image frames are extracted from the captured thermal video from the healthy and faulty IM at varying speed conditions. Thereafter, Residual Network (ResNet) is used for extraction of features, followed by further classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) at various fault conditions. The findings demonstrate that the suggested technique outperforms traditional vibration-based methods in identifying various IM faults at varying speed conditions. © 2022 IEEE.","fault diagnosis; Induction motor; passive thermal imaging; SVM","Costs; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Induction motors; Infrared imaging; Maintenance; Speed; Vibration analysis; Faults detection; Faults diagnosis; Inductions motors; Maintenance cost; Passive thermal imaging; Prime-movers; Support vectors machine; Thermal-imaging; Varying speed conditions; Vibration signal; Support vector machines",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665480574,,,"English","IEEE Int.

This paper introduces a standalone electric system with a common 415V-AC bus powered by a photovoltaic (PV) system. Due to the irregular availability of RES, incorporating the energy storage system (ESS) is needed.

MDSOGI is a modified version of the damped-SOGI structure, where frequency is estimated by integrating a frequency locked-loop (FLL) algorithm that utilizes the quadrature shifted components of the DSOGI structure.

As charging infrastructure is the key determinant for the large-scale adoption of electric vehicles, state-of-the-art scheduling and control strategies need to be explored. The charging of electric vehicles in a conventional charging station even with the fast dc-dc chargers takes around 30 min, which results in congestion and large waiting queues at public charging stations. To account for this issue, a novel strategy of routing and scheduling mobile charging stations to charge electric vehicles without the constraints of time and space is discussed in detail. Furthermore, the traveling times of mobile charging stations in reality are stochastic in nature. We formulate the optimization problem to minimize the cost of charging and show that the problem formulated is a combination of a bin packing problem and a multicity traveling salesman problem; hence, it is NP-hard and cannot be solved in reasonable CPU time, unless P = NP. We, thus, present modified saving's heuristic and modified genetic algorithm metaheuristic to solve the optimization problem.

Thus, research is oriented toward a viable and universal solution to renewable energy based power generation. Though much progress is made in this frontier, there are still specific problems in the conventional control approach. Set-point controllers, an easy choice for control architecture, fail to satisfy the intermittent natured SPV source, compelling to look for a dynamic gain tuning technique to overcome stability margin issues. In this article, a graph signal processing least mean pth (GNLMP) adaptive current control method is introduced, which is computationally fast, robust, and improves the power quality (PQ) of the injected utility current. A microgrid, by definition, must possess the facility to work in an islanded mode to supply local commodities whenever there is a utility outage or utility faults and resynchronizes to the utility when the grid codes are in match according to the IEEE-519 std. Synchronization is demonstrated here using a more stable enhanced phase-locked loop (Ms-EPLL) technique, a modified version of EPLL. The PLL technique is more stable than EPLL by adding nonlinear term in each of phase and amplitude line. The GNLMP current control and Ms-EPLL synchronization technique are verified for acceptable steady-state and dynamic behavior via tests performed on an experimental setup. Seamless transfer synchronization and meeting PQ as the IEEE-519 std., i.e., total harmonic distortion <5%, are the significant outcome of this article. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Adaptive control; battery energy storage (BES); graph signal processing least mean pth (GNLMP); islanding detection; microgrid; more stable enhanced phase-locked loop (Ms-EPLL); power quality (PQ); renewable energy (RE); voltage source converter (VSC)","Climate change; Distributed power generation; Electric batteries; Electric current control; Locks (fasteners); Phase locked loops; Quality control; Renewable energy resources; Signal processing; Solar power generation; Synchronization; Adaptive Control; Battery energy storage; Graph signal processing least mean pth; Islanding detection; Microgrid; More stable enhanced phase-locked loop; Power quality; Renewable energies; Renewable energy; Signal-processing; Voltage source; Voltage source converter; Power quality","Chishti, F.; Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India; email: chishti2210@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00939994,,ITIAC,,"English","IEEE Trans Ind Appl",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139226185

In the era of machine learning, an intelligent model is required to learn non-linear interactions of the wind speed with less complexity and high efficiency. Gradient boosting machines (GBM) produce reliable predictions without much pre-processing and are natural in various forecasting competitions. In this paper, we compare three prevalent GB based ensemble methods for wind speed forecasting, which are Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting (LGB), and Categorical Gradient boosting (CatBoost) machine models. In XGBoost, regularisation of the objective function is done with its capability of handling missing values and sparsity, due to which this method shows high accuracy. In LGB, weights are assigned to the smaller and larger gradients in descending order, and then only larger gradients are considered, which makes it very fast in computation. In CatBoost, training data is selected by random permutation of the entire data-set, which makes it faster when compared with XGBoost.

IM failure is one of the most prevalent reasons for EV failure. This paper presents a fault diagnosis method for IM to enhance the efficiency, performance, and availability of EV and to reduce its maintenance costs. Firstly, current and vibration signatures were acquired at varying speed conditions from four IMs having different fault conditions. The acquired signatures were decomposed using Hilbert Transform (HT) and further converted into the time-frequency domain using Constant-Q Transform (CQT).

The PMSG is driven by a wind turbine. The basic structure of sliding mode observer (SMO) includes a discontinuous signum function and low pass filter, which introduces not only chattering but also delay in the estimated position. To deal with the issue of classical SMO, RAPO consisting of sigmoid function based continuous super twisting SMO (CSTSMO) followed by a multilayered fourth order generalized integrator (MFGI) is used for this purpose. The CSTSMO is robust and with continuous switching function, it provides results with less chattering. The MFGI filters out the lower order dominating harmonics and ensues the fundamental signals, which helps in calculating accurate position and speed of PMSG. This technique is implemented on a wind battery energy storage based microgrid, which is operable in off-grid as well as in grid interfaced mode. This microgrid is suitable for rural areas, which suffers from the grid unavailability. Seamless transition between the operating modes is included for avoiding transients in the system during de-synchronization or resynchronization of utility grid. Furthermore, the system is proficient to mitigate some of the power quality issues. The system model is built in MATLAB/Simulink software and simulated results are validated through hardware results. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Encoder-less speed control; microgrid; power quality; seamless transition; wind energy generation","Adaptive control systems; Bandpass filters; Harmonic analysis; Low pass filters; MATLAB; Permanent magnets; Power quality; Quality control; Signal encoding; Sliding mode control; Speed control; Wind power; Wind turbines; Encoder-less speed control; Microgrid; Observer; Permanent magnet synchronous generator; Power harmonic filters; Robust adaptive; Seamless transition; Wind energy generation; Wind power generation; Electric power generation","Pradhan, S.; Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India; email: subarni89@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00939994,,ITIAC,,"English","IEEE Trans Ind Appl",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129624602

As a result, using quantum-inspired meta-heuristics in Quantum-Inspired Self-supervised Neural Network models improves their hyper-parameters and inter-connection weights. The goal of this paper is to propose an improved version of a Quantum-Inspired Self-supervised Neural Network (QIS-Net) model for brain lesion segmentation. The proposed Optimized Quantum-Inspired Self-supervised Neural Network (Opti-QISNet) model is based on the QIS-Net architecture, and its operations are used to get the best segmentation results. A Quantum-Inspired Optimized Multi-Level Sigmoidal (Opti-QSig) activation is the optimized activation function used in the described model. Three quantum-inspired meta-heuristics improve the Opti-QSig activation function, with fitness evaluated using Otsu’s multi-level thresholding. Experiments were carried out using brain MR images from the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) in the Nature data repository.

This article demonstrates an inherent instability phenomenon in the synchronous reference frame phase locked-loop (SRF-PLL). The need for the small-signal model improvement and Floquet-stability-theory-based analysis is thereby demonstrated. Furthermore, decoupled double synchronous reference frame (DDSRF) PLL, which is a benchmark tool for unbalanced grid synchronization, is investigated for its behavior upon small disturbances. A precise sixth-order small-signal linear time-periodic model of DDSRF-PLL is obtained considering parameters of the input signal as well as of PLL. Floquet-theory-based stability and modal analysis are carried out to gain insights into dynamic properties of DDSRF-PLL. Impacts of distortions in grid voltage such as unbalance, harmonics, jumps in amplitude, phase, and frequency are analyzed for both performance and stability.

Coronavirus is a lung infection disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2). Because of its high transmission rate, it is crucial to detect cases as soon as possible to effectively control the spread of this pandemic and treat patients in the early stages. RT-PCR-based kits are the current standard kits used for COVID-19 diagnosis, but these tests take much time despite their high precision. A faster automated diagnostic tool is required for the effective screening of COVID-19. Methods: In this study, a new semi-supervised feature learning technique is proposed to screen COVID-19 patients using chest CT scans. The model proposed in this study uses a three-step architecture, consisting of a convolutional autoencoder based unsupervised feature extractor, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) based feature selector, and a Bagging Ensemble of support vector machines based binary classifier. The proposed architecture has been designed to provide precise and robust diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs.nonCOVID). A dataset of 1252 COVID-19 CT scan images, collected from 60 patients, has been used to train and evaluate the model. Results: The best performing classifier within 127 ms per image achieved an accuracy of 98.79%, the precision of 98.47%, area under curve of 0.998, and an F1 score of 98.85% on 497 test images. The proposed model outperforms the current state of the art COVID-19 diagnostic techniques in terms of speed and accuracy.

In this article, a unique control strategy is presented for the control of solar photovoltaic (PV) system interfaced to the grid utilizing an interweaved generalized integrator. A single-stage three-phase topology is considered. The primary purpose of control is to deliver the PV power to the grid even during various abnormal grid variations. During normal operation, the system delivers power at unity power factor. However, during variations in the grid voltage, the profile of the PCC voltage is maintained within prescribed limits by reactive power injection. Moreover, LVRT operation is undertaken during severe voltage sags. The utilization of the system is increased in the absence of PV generation during night, the VSC and dc link capacitor act as a distribution static compensator. Contrary to traditional control techniques, power quality of the system is not compromised.

This communication backbone in turn also exposes MGs to potential malicious cyber attacks. To study these vulnerabilities and impacts of various cyber attacks, testbeds play a crucial role in managing their complexity. This research work presents a detailed study of the development of a real-time co-simulation testbed for inverter-based MGs. It consists of a OP5700 real-time simulator, which is used to emulate both the physical and cyber layer of an AC MG in real time through HYPERSIM software; and SEL-3530 Real-Time Automation Controller (RTAC) hardware configured with ACSELERATOR RTAC SEL-5033 software. A human–machine interface (HMI) is used for local/remote monitoring and control. The creation and management of HMI is carried out in ACSELERATOR Diagram Builder SEL-5035 software. Furthermore, communication protocols such as Modbus, sampled measured values (SMVs), generic object-oriented substation event (GOOSE) and distributed network protocol 3 (DNP3) on an Ethernet-based interface were established, which map the interaction among the corresponding nodes of cyber-physical layers and also synchronizes data transmission between the systems. The testbed not only provides a real-time co-simulation environment for the validation of the control and protection algorithms but also extends to the verification of various detection and mitigation algorithms. Moreover, an attack scenario is also presented to demonstrate the ability of the testbed. Finally, challenges and future research directions are recognized and discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

The proposed CVC scheme coordinates multiple home energy management systems (HEMS) connected on a low-voltage radial distribution network through a sensitivity-based approach to minimize voltage deviations in multiple timescales owing to high photovoltaic (PV) penetrations and load variability. In order to mitigate the effects of uncertain PV output and load during actual system operation, a day-ahead two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model has been developed, which optimizes network operation in the longer timescale, for worst-case realization of uncertainties in shorter timescales. This is sequentially followed by fully distributed hour-ahead CVC which is decomposed into network optimization and energy management subproblems through alternating direction method of multipliers. In order to counteract the effects of real-time uncertainties, local adjustments are performed by redispatching HEMS at individual households to locally adapt to unforeseen variations, thereby minimizing real-time voltage deviations. Extensive simulations are performed on the modified Dutch LV network. Simulation results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed multilevel CVC approach to robustly handle uncertainties while ensuring reliable operation and maximum user-comfort. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Alternating direction method of multipliers; demand response; home energy management; sensitivity analysis; two-stage robust optimization; voltage control","Energy management; Housing; Optimization; Solar buildings; Voltage control; Alternating direction method of multipliers; Coordinated voltage control; Distributed voltages; Extensive simulations; Home energy management systems; Network optimization; Radial distribution networks; Voltage optimization; Energy management systems","Sharma, S.; Centre for Energy Studies, India; email: sharmasumedha.16@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00939994,,ITIAC,,"English","IEEE Trans Ind Appl",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105860466

Automated segmentation of the lungs is an important step to design a computer-aided diagnostic tool for examination of a CxR. Precise lung segmentation is considered extremely challenging because of variance in the shape of the lung caused by health issues, age, and gender. The proposed work investigates the use of an efficient deep convolutional neural network for accurate segmentation of lungs from CxR. We attempt an end to end DeepLabv3+ network which integrates DeepLab architecture, encoder-decoder, and dilated convolution for semantic lung segmentation with fast training and high accuracy. We experimented with the different pre-trained base networks: Resnet18 and Mobilenetv2, associated with the Deeplabv3+ model for performance analysis. The proposed approach does not require any pre-processing technique on chest x-ray images before being fed to a neural network. We construct a dataset of CxR images with corresponding lung mask of the Indian population that contain healthy and unhealthy CxRs of clinically confirmed patients of tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, pleural effusion, and lung cancer. The proposed method is tested on 688 images of our Indian CxR dataset including images with severe abnormal findings to validate its robustness. We also experimented on commonly used benchmark datasets such as Japanese Society of Radiological Technology; Montgomery County, and Shenzhen, China for state-of-the-art comparison.

An interleaved phase-shifted bridgeless converter is widely preferred for ac-dc bidirectional power conversion due to its reduced switching loss and a significant decrease in passive filter components. However, the converter commutation process during phase-reversal in the presence of grid distortion often adds complexity to achieve zero voltage switching. Estimation of grid frequency and closer zero-crossing detection (ZCD) at the point of common coupling during abnormal grid conditions are the key challenges for the successive operation of bridgeless converter topology. This article describes an adaptive grid-frequency identification technique with noise uncertainty to identify a closer phase-reversal occurrence for ZCD. The DSMC, in addition, offers flexibility toward parametric variation with a gain adaptive control. A modification in the phase-shift algorithm of dc-dc power converter is also explained with the inclusion of charging dynamics of battery operation.

In this paper, a Multi-level Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) algorithm is proposed to find the architecture and hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) simultaneously. This automated learning will reduce the overhead of human experts to find these parameters through manual analysis and experiments. The proposed solution uses multiple swarms at two levels. The initial swarm at level-1 optimizes architecture and multiple swarms at level-2 optimize hyperparameters. The proposed method has used sigmoid like inertia weight to adjust the exploration and exploitation property of particles and avoid the PSO algorithm to prematurely converge into a local optimum solution. In this paper, we have explored an approach to suggest the best well-conditioned CNN architecture and its hyperparameters using MPSO in a specified search space. The complexity and performance of MPSO-CNN will depend on the dimension of the search space. The experimental results on 5 benchmark datasets of MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Convex Sets, and MDRBI have demonstrated one more effective application of PSO in learning a deep neural architecture. © 2021","Convolution Neural Network; Evolutionary; Multiple swarms; Neural networksl; Particle Swarm Optimization","Benchmarking; Biomimetics; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Network architecture; Set theory; Automated learning; Benchmark datasets; Exploration and exploitation; Local optimum solution; Neural architectures; Optimization algorithms; Real-world problem; Stochastic optimization algorithm; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Singh, P.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: pratibhahbti2004@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",22106502,,,,"English","Swarm Evol.

The complexity of the problem escalates with incorporation of uncertain and intermittent renewable sources into the electrical network.Flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices are also becoming more commonplace in modern power system to mitigate growing demand and to relieve congestion from the network. This paper aims to solve the OPF where the generation cost is optimized with incorporation of stochastic wind power and several types of FACTS devices such as static VAR compensator, thyristor-controlled series compensator and thyristor-controlled phase shifter. Case studies with both fixed and uncertain load demands are performed. The stochastic wind energy and load demand are modeled using suitable probability density functions. Optimization objective considers cost of thermal generation, direct cost of scheduled wind power, penalty cost for underestimation and reserve cost for overestimation of the wind power. In addition, both locations and ratings of the FACTS devices are optimized to minimize total generation cost of the system. Success history-based adaptive differential evolution (SHADE), a powerful evolutionary algorithm, is adopted to perform the optimization task. The constraints of OPF problem are handled using superiority of feasible solutions (SF) method. The integration approach of SF method with several popular metaheuristic algorithms has been proposed in this work, and a detailed comparative analysis among various algorithms establishes SHADE algorithm to be the best performer. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Adaptive differential evolution; FACTS devices; Optimal power flow; Uncertain load demand; Wind power","Acoustic generators; Electric load flow; Electric network parameters; Evolutionary algorithms; Optimization; Probability density function; Static Var compensators; Stochastic systems; Thyristors; Wind power; Adaptive differential evolutions; Comparative analysis; Integration approach; Meta heuristic algorithm; Optimal placement and sizings; Optimization problems; Thyristor controlled phase shifters; Thyristor controlled series compensator; Flexible AC transmission systems","Biswas, P.P.; Advanced Digital Sciences CenterSingapore; email: partha.b@adsc-create.edu.sg",,"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",09410643,,,,"English","Neural Comput.

An early-stage detection of COVID-19 is crucial for the containment of the pandemic it has caused. In this study, a transfer learning–based COVID-19 screening technique is proposed. The motivation of this study is to design an automated system that can assist medical staff especially in areas where trained staff are outnumbered. The study investigates the potential of transfer learning–based models for automatically diagnosing diseases like COVID-19 to assist the medical force, especially in times of an outbreak. In the proposed work, a deep learning model, i.e., truncated VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group from Oxford) is implemented to screen COVID-19 CT scans. The VGG16 architecture is fine-tuned and used to extract features from CT scan images. Further principal component analysis (PCA) is used for feature selection. For the final classification, four different classifiers, namely deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), online sequential ELM, and bagging ensemble with support vector machine (SVM) are compared. The best performing classifier bagging ensemble with SVM within 385 ms achieved an accuracy of 95.7%, the precision of 95.8%, area under curve (AUC) of 0.958, and an F1 score of 95.3% on 208 test images. The results obtained on diverse datasets prove the superiority and robustness of the proposed work. A pre-processing technique has also been proposed for radiological data.

This paper introduces a qualitative study on the effects of thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC) on the distance protection strategies for PS and also suggest modifications in the conventional distance protection logic. Power Swing Blocking (PSB) is a complimentary feature integrated with the conventional distance relay to detect PS. However, the addition of TCSC along with its fast-acting control loop results in the PSB scheme to experience a reduction in the recorded time by the timer thus leading to failure in detecting the encroachment of the apparent impedance to be a PS and thus causes maloperation of the distance relay. An Empirical Wavelet Based technique has been proposed to rectify these maloperations in TCSC incorporated transmission lines to contribute to improve stability by preventing undesirable tripping. The case studies have been implemented on the WSCC 9 bus system with the detailed dynamic model of the TCSC. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the suggested technique in overcoming the shortcomings of the conventional distance relay strategy. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Distance relay; power swing (PS); power system faults; power system security; thyristors controlled series capacitor (TCSC)","Control systems; Electric fault currents; Flexible AC transmission systems; Apparent impedance; Distance protection; Flexible ac transmission system (FACTS); Impedance characteristics; Power swing blocking; Protection schemes; Qualitative assessments; Thyristor controlled series capacitor; Electric relays","Das, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: sayaridas1990@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",08858977,,ITPDE,,"English","IEEE Trans Power Delivery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100538822

However, it has tracking problems during varying irradiations as well as the nuisance of oscillations around the maximum power point (MPP). This work introduces a circle center-line concept based P&O (CCCP&O) algorithm for MPPT, where, the concept of circle and its center are combined with the PO algorithm. This algorithm tends to reduce the number of iterations taken to reach the MPP, which reduces settling time. Moreover, the problem of large oscillations around the MPP is eliminated by using the concept of flexible step size. The algorithm initializes with standard PO, but utilizes a approach of diameter equivalence of a circle as a procedure to reach next operating point on the power-voltage plot. Therefore, the iterations required to get to the MPP are reduced substantially. The MPP changes with change in solar irradiance, therefore, a concept of artificial envelope around the P-V curve is used to improve tracking of the algorithm during varying irradiances. The overall performance of the algorithm is demonstrated and compared in simulation using SIMULINK MATLAB as well as also shown experimentally in a developed hardware prototype. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Artificial envelope; circle center-line concept; P&O MPPT; solar PV array","Energy conversion; MATLAB; Maximum power point trackers; Hardware prototype; Maximum power point; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Number of iterations; Operating points; Solar irradiances; Solar photovoltaic energies; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar energy","Saxena, V.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: vardan.saxena97@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15498328,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

As compared to mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), VANETs are mainly different in terms of characteristics, and system architecture. Security in VANET has been an important issue as it effects the communication between both (V-2-V) vehicles-to-vehicle and (V-2-I) vehicle to infrastructure. In VANET, malicious attacks affect the security of the networks, and it is necessary to identify and prevent such security attacks. In VANET network, any node can function as a router for the others nodes, and a malicious node connected to the network may inject spoofed routing tables to the other nodes thereby affecting the operation of the network. To overcome this issue, a secure AODV routing protocol is developed for detection of black hole attack in this paper. The proposed method is a modified version of the original AODV routing protocol with improvements in the RREQ packet and RREP packet protocols. For added security, a cryptography function-based encryption and decryption is included to verify the source and destination nodes. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a NS-2.33 simulator using different network parameters like drop packets, end-to-end delay, and packet delivery ratio (PDR) and routing request overhead. Results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing AODV routing protocol under black hole attack and improves the network performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV); Black hole attack; Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET); Performance parameters; Routing protocol; Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET)","Binary alloys; Cryptography; Gravitation; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Mobile security; Routing algorithms; Routing protocols; Stars; Vehicle to infrastructure; Vehicles; Vehicular ad hoc networks; AODV routing protocol; Cryptography functions; Encryption and decryption; Intelligent transportation systems; Mobile adhoc network (MANETs); Packet delivery ratio; Safety and securities; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Network security","Veluvolu, K.C.; School of Electronics Engineering, South Korea; email: veluvolu@ee.knu.ac.kr",,"Elsevier B.V.",01419331,,MIMID,,"English","Microprocessors Microsyst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094145937

Nowadays, with the advent of artificial intelligence, deep neural networks are playing crucial role in data modeling and analysis. In this article, models of three different families of network architectures such as feed-forward neural network (FNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) are proposed for battery capacity estimation. Measurements from a set of two rechargeable Li-ion batteries are considered for the model performance evaluation. The battery capacity estimation by different models has been evaluated by considering the effect of certain parameters such as model complexity, sampling rate of battery measurable signals and type of battery measurable signals. With its ability to process time-series data efficiently by memorizing long-term dependencies, LSTM outperforms other model architectures in estimating battery capacity more accurately and flexibly with 4.69% and 19.16% decline in average test root mean square error (RMSE) as compared with FNN and CNN, respectively. Simpler architectures of LSTM and FNN are able to perform well as compared with CNN, which needs architecture with certain hidden layers to interpret the battery aging process. Moreover, investigations reveal that sparsely sampled battery signals help all the proposed models to learn the battery dynamics in a better way as compared to densely sampled battery signals which also entails for less complex model learning process. Further, among all battery measurable signals, battery temperature has relatively less weightage in estimating battery capacity. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","electric vehicles; energy efficiency; Li-ion battery; LSTM","Automotive batteries; Complex networks; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Feedforward neural networks; Learning systems; Lithium compounds; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Network architecture; Battery temperature; Capacity estimation; Electrochemical phenomena; Long-term dependencies; Model and analysis; Model architecture; Model performance evaluations; Root mean square errors; Lithium-ion batteries","Garg, A.; Centre for Automotive Research and Tribology, India; email: akhil@cart.iitd.ac.in",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",0363907X,,IJERD,,"English","Int.

In this paper we propose an online charging discharging decision sequence for electric vehicles in a commercial charging station to minimize the overall cost of charging the electric vehicles while satisfying the number of constraints. The control problem has been formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, which aims to reduce the cost of charging the electric vehicles, reducing the frequent change in charging rates, flattening the load profile subject to equality and inequality constrains of the chargers and the grid.

The paper employs Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to segregate transient events from oscillatory behavior that follows these events. The paper also proposes a novel indicator for the classification of transient events based on the most affected signals in due course of the event. Empirical Mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert spectral analysis (HSA) are utilized on the PMU signals severely affected by the event and further examine the oscillatory modes succeeding the real-Time events. Oscillatory modes deduced from the above adaptive transformations are further categorized into three frequency bands based on power system control applications, thus helping operators provide efficient control actions.

Conventional algorithms for current control in micro grid system suffers from stability margin issue. This algorithm filters the existing signal corrupted by non-Gaussian noise. The steady-state response becomes more stable due to its fast convergence and robust behaviour. Voltage control is generally preferred for islanded conditions to set voltage and frequency for connected local consumer loads. In reconnection with the utility grid, synchronization with the utility phase is necessary because the phase angle mismatch causes transient current spikes, which are detrimental to the lifespan of the power electronic interface. For the issue of synchronization, more-stable enhanced PLL (Ms-EPLL), having a better stability margin, is used and compared to conventional enhanced PLL. This system integrates double stage solar PV array with a battery associated directly at DC link. The focus of this work is mainly two-fold, i.e., grid-integrated control to improve power quality (PQ) and synchronization technique to reduce the current spikes that can damage the semiconductor switches in the power converters of the micro grid (MG) system.

For real-parameter problems, it takes two or more high-performing population members and blends them to create one or more new solutions. Many real-parameter recombination operators have been proposed in the literature. Each operator involves at least a parameter that controls the extent of exploration (diversity) of the generated offspring population. It has been observed that different recombination operators and specific parameters produce the best performance for different problems. This fact imposes the user to use different operator and parameter combinations for every new problem. While an automated algorithm configuration method can be applied to find the best combination, in this paper, we propose an Ensembled Crossover based Evolutionary Algorithm (EnXEA), which considers a number of recombination operators simultaneously. Their parameter values and applies them with a probability updated adaptively in proportion to their success in creating better offspring solutions. Results on single-objective and multi-objective, constrained, and unconstrained problems indicate that EnXEA's performance is close to the best individual recombination operation for each problem.

These systems on one hand are susceptible to grid/system faults, whereas on the other hand, ICT can easily be the potential target of the third-party adversaries. On top, the transient response of cyber-physical power electronics based power systems (PEPS) to the said critical disturbances is very fast, which becomes another challenge to distinguish them accurately within a short time frame. To address this challenge, this paper certifies cyber-physical anomalies using physics-informed empirical laws governed by mapping X-Y plane between locally measured frequency (f) and d-axis voltage (Vd) only, forming a decentralized approach. The anomaly characterization between physical and cyber faults is carried out by tracing the trajectory movement online in the aforementioned X-Y plane. Basically, the physics-informed laws determine the boundaries in this plane to segregate between grid faults and cyber attacks. This decentralized method is effective in classifying the anomalies only within 5 ms (with 20 samples/cycle in a 50 Hz system), which has been validated on modified CIGRE LV benchmark distribution network with real-time (RT) simulations in OPAL-RT environment with HYPERSIM software. © 2021 IEEE.","Cyber attacks; Cyberphysical systems; Decentralized anomaly characterization; Faults","Computer crime; Crime; Cyber attacks; Cyber Physical System; Electric power transmission networks; Network security; Power electronics; Transient analysis; Cyber physicals; Cyber-physical systems; Decentralised; Decentralized anomaly characterization; Fault; Grid systems; Information and Communication Technologies; Physical power; Power; Power-electronics; Embedded systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665436359,,,"English","IEEE Workshop Control Model.

This charger in AC-DC conversion stage has an inherent tendency to produce low frequency voltage ripple in both DC-link and split DC-link capacitor voltages. Therefore, bulky high valued electrolytic capacitors are adopted to absorb these low frequency capacitor ripples. Replacing these electrolytic capacitors with low valued film capacitors, results in poor input power quality. Therefore, this paper presents a control strategy based on modified unit-template control with reduced DC-link capacitance value to achieve improved input power quality without using any additional active/passive components. In modified unit-template control, the harmonics information of the grid current is feed-forwarded into the unit template to achieve unity power factor operation and reduced grid current THD. Furthermore, to reduce the influence of double frequency component on EV current/voltage, a DC-link feedforward control is implemented in DC-DC stage. Finally, the effectiveness of the solution presented in this paper, is verified by simulation and experimental results. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Capacitance; Charging (batteries); DC-DC converters; Electric drives; Electric machine control; Electric power system control; Electrolytic capacitors; Feedforward control; Power control; Power electronics; Quality control; Rectifying circuits; Ac/dc conversion; Dc-link; DC-link capacitance; Grid current; Input power; Low frequency voltage; Motor drive; Power quality control; Template control; Voltage source; Power quality",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728151359,,,"English","IEEE Energy Convers.

The task is challenging owing to shortage and ineffectiveness of clinical testing kits. However, the existing problems can be improved by employing computational intelligent techniques on radiological images like CT-Scans (Computed Tomography) of lungs. Extensive research has been reported using deep learning models to diagnose the severity of COVID-19 from CT images. This has undoubtedly minimized the manual involvement in abnormality identification but reported detection accuracy is limited. Methods: The present work proposes an expert model based on deep features and Parameter Free BAT (PF-BAT) optimized Fuzzy K-nearest neighbor (PF-FKNN) classifier to diagnose novel coronavirus. In this proposed model, features are extracted from the fully connected layer of transfer learned MobileNetv2 followed by FKNN training. The hyperparameters of FKNN are fine-tuned using PF-BAT. Results: The experimental results on the benchmark COVID CT scan data reveal that the proposed algorithm attains a validation accuracy of 99.38% which is better than the existing state-of-the-art methods proposed in past. Conclusion: The proposed model will help in timely and accurate identification of the coronavirus at the various phases. Such kind of rapid diagnosis will assist clinicians to manage the healthcare condition of patients well and will help in speedy recovery from the diseases. Clinical and Translational Impact Statement - The proposed automated system can provide accurate and fast detection of COVID-19 signature from lung radiographs. Also, the usage of lighter MobileNetv2 architecture makes it practical for deployment in real-time. © 2013 IEEE.","COVID-19; Deep features; Diagnosis; Parameter free BAT optimization","Deep learning; Diagnosis; Nearest neighbor search; Patient rehabilitation; Viruses; Automated diagnosis; Automatic systems; Computed tomography scan; Disease detection; Fuzzy k nearest neighbor (FKNN); Health-care system; Manual intervention; Medical professionals; Computerized tomography; adult; algorithm; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; entropy; human; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; methodology; mobilenetv2; nonhuman; parameter free bat; performance indicator; x-ray computed tomography; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; female; lung; male; procedures; Algorithms; COVID-19; Deep Learning; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Male; SARS-CoV-2; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Gandhi, T.K.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: tgandhi@ee.iitd.ac.in",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21682372,,,"34235005","English","IEEE J.

It is a daunting task for the researchers to find suitable infection patterns on lung CT images for automated diagnosis of COVID-19. A novel integrated semi-supervised shallow neural network framework comprising a Parallel Quantum-Inspired Self-supervised Network (PQIS-Net) for automatic segmentation of lung CT images followed by Fully Connected (FC) layers, is proposed in this article. The proposed PQIS-Net model is aimed at providing fully automated segmentation of lung CT slices without incorporating pre-trained convolutional neural network based models. A parallel trinity of layered structure of quantum bits are interconnected using an N -connected second order neighborhood-based topology in the suggested PQIS-Net architecture for segmentation of lung CT slices with wide variations of local intensities. A random patch-based classification on PQIS-Net segmented slices is incorporated at the classification layers of the suggested semi-supervised shallow neural network framework. Intensive experiments have been conducted using three publicly available data sets, one for purely segmentation task and the other two for classification (COVID-19 diagnosis). The experimental outcome on segmentation of CT slices using self-supervised PQIS-Net and the diagnosis efficiency (Accuracy, Precision and AUC) of the integrated semi-supervised shallow framework is found to be promising. The proposed model is also found to be superior than the best state-of-the-art techniques and pre-trained convolutional neural network-based models, specially in COVID-19 and Mycoplasma Pneumonia (MP) screening. © 2013 IEEE.","3D-UNet; COVID-19; Lung CT image segmentation; QIS-Net; ResNet50","Biological organs; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Computerized tomography; Convolution; Image segmentation; Multilayer neural networks; Respiratory system; Semi-supervised learning; Automated diagnosis; Automatic segmentations; Human respiratory system; Infection patterns; Layered Structures; NET architecture; Network frameworks; Supervised network; Convolutional neural networks","Bhattacharyya, S.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India; email: dr.siddhartha.bhattacharyya@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100858785

The proposed BEMS aims to optimally dispatch building components to counteract operational uncertainties encountered in real-time operation due to RES and electrical load. Owing to different response times of building components, BEMS has been time-decomposed into two timescales. In the longer timescale (hourly-ahead), fuel cell-based micro-combined cooling, heating and power unit, energy storage systems and thermal load control are dispatched, while in the shorter timescale (15-min ahead), battery energy storage is re-dispatched and electrical demand response is activated. Multi-timescale coordination is achieved through a bi-level optimization framework, where a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model optimizes system operation for realization of any level of uncertainty in the upper level. A recourse decision is computed by lower-level optimization during actual system operation.

An adversary injects false data in this system by compromising some of the idle sensor nodes (SNs) of the WPSN. Using the WPSN for transmitting supervision and control data, in the aforementioned setting, makes the CPS vulnerable to both error and false data injection (FDI). The existing techniques of launching stealthy FDI attack are not applicable to the aforementioned network due to the random nature of wireless channels, which is used for both transmitting control and false data. The objectives of the adversary and the CC to launch stealthy FDI attack and to detect the same, respectively, are found to be depending on the powers they use for transmitting data over wireless channels. The transmit powers of the CC, and the adversary that fulfill their respective objectives are derived by modeling their interaction as a Bayesian Stackelberg game. Based on their objectives, novel utility functions are defined for the CC and the adversary. Subsequently, the equilibrium of the proposed game is obtained by solving a non-convex bi-level quadratic-quadratic program.

(2) Pixels sharing the same appearance must have the same transmission value in a local neighborhood. Inspired by above assumptions, an image boundary constraint utilizing the median filter has been imposed on the RGB channel for the rough estimation of transmission-map in aerial images.

Recently, the lung infection due to SARS-CoV-2 has affected a larger human community globally, and due to its rapidity, the World-Health-Organisation (WHO) declared it as pandemic disease. The COVID-19 disease has adverse effects on the respiratory system, and the infection severity can be detected using a chosen imaging modality. In the proposed research work; the COVID-19 is detected using transfer learning from CT scan images decomposed to three-level using stationary wavelet. A three-phase detection model is proposed to improve the detection accuracy and the procedures are as follows; Phase1- data augmentation using stationary wavelets, Phase2- COVID-19 detection using pre-trained CNN model and Phase3- abnormality localization in CT scan images. This work has considered the well known pre-trained architectures, such as ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, and SqueezeNet for the experimental evaluation. In this work, 70% of images are considered to train the network and 30% images are considered to validate the network. The performance of the considered architectures is evaluated by computing the common performance measures. The result of the experimental evaluation confirms that the ResNet18 pre-trained transfer learning-based model offered better classification accuracy (training = 99.82%, validation = 97.32%, and testing = 99.4%) on the considered image dataset compared with the alternatives. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; CT scan; ResNet18; Transfer learning; Wavelets","Biological organs; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Diseases; Image enhancement; Network architecture; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Respiratory system; Statistical tests; Transfer learning; Automated detection; Classification accuracy; Detection accuracy; Experimental evaluation; Learning Based Models; Lung abnormalities; Performance measure; Stationary wavelet; Computerized tomography","Ahuja, S.; Electrical Engineering Department, India; email: Sakshi.Ahuja@ee.iitd.ac.in",,"Springer",0924669X,,APITE,,"English","Appl Intell",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089672303

Governments across the world are implementing schemes for rollout of electric vehicles however a well-established charging infrastructure is the foremost requirement. Apart from setting up the charging network, it is equally important to ensure its optimal operation. Battery swapping has emerged as a feasible solution for quick charging of vehicles and makes immense sense for light duty vehicles. However, the optimal placement of such stations ensuring ease of access is a critical problem given the space constraints in city areas. Battery swapping stations may have a dedicated charging station or can be catered by a network of charging stations distributed conveniently across the city. The present work formulates the problem of determining the best locations for swapping stations so as to reduce the cost of transporting batteries from a set of charging stations and to ensure ease of access to vehicles in a city that has a symmetrical plan. A mathematical optimization framework has been created to solve the problem of optimal siting of battery swapping stations in the described city layout. The results are encouraging and the methodology can be of interest to city mobility planners and can also be applied to areas where an asymmetrical electric vehicle arrangement exists. © 2020 IEEE.","Battery Swapping Station (BSS); Electric Vehicle; Optimal Placement; Optimization Techniques","Automotive batteries; Electric vehicles; Light weight vehicles; Optimization; Power electronics; Charging infrastructures; Electric vehicle batteries; Implementing scheme; Light duty vehicles; Mathematical optimizations; Optimal operation; Optimal placements; Space constraints; Fast charging (Batteries)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728156729,,,"English","IEEE Int.

So far, charging stations have been considered as the primary source for recharging EVs. However, a significant time is is taken at the charging station to recharge a single EV. This problem is addressed by Battery Swapping Stations (BSS) that allow for swapping a depleted battery (DB) with a charged battery (CB). As with charging stations, the participating entities remain to be the grid, the aggregator, service station(s) and the EV owner. However, a variation exists in their interaction. In this work, a scheduling management scheme is presented for an aggregator to maximize its profit while managing BSS in a densely populated area. Furthermore, this has been explored for a varying number of requests. Furthermore, a PV assist has also been considered for BSS, where the depleted batteries may be charged through the PV assist. In both cases, with and without penalty for unscheduled EVs, in the case of no PV assist and with PV assist, results indicated that maximum profit was observed in the case of PV assist. Furthermore, more batteries were found to be available for swapping in the case with PV assist. © 2020 IEEE.","Charging Cost; Charging scheduling; Collaborative Scheduling; Electric Vehicle; Unscheduled Penalty","Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Power electronics; Profitability; Scheduling; Battery swapping; Charging station; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Management scheme; Maximum profits; Primary sources; Vehicle penetration; Automotive batteries",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728156729,,,"English","IEEE Int.

This paper demonstrates an implicit wide range of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charger based upon a single-ended primary inductor converter (SEPIC) and PV connectivity for improvement of grid power quality in the presence of grid abnormality. The Level-I PEV charger is uniquely identified due to its suitability to adopt a wide range of battery voltage by incorporating a two-stage decoupled control action with a front-end multi-resonant control (MRC). The implemented parallel resonant controller successfully eliminates the low-frequency odd harmonics at a very poor grid condition and maintains the unity power factor (UPF) at the utility. In addition, the photo-voltaic (PV) connectivity improves the grid reliability by providing additional power to both utility and EV unit during peak hour charging demand. The controller is developed and verified in a MATLAB/SIMULINK platform for a 3.3 kW isolated EV charger. The control implementation and EV charging phenomenon with a multi-resonant controller are also verified with the Opal-RT hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulator in presence of grid disturbances. © 2020 IEEE.","PEV charger; Photo-voltaic (PV); Power quality improvement; Proportional resonant (PR) control","Controllers; Electric power transmission networks; Fast charging (Batteries); Image enhancement; Plug-in electric vehicles; Power electronics; Resonance; Secondary batteries; Vehicle-to-grid; Control implementation; Decoupled control; Parallel resonant; Plug in Electric Vehicle (PEV); Resonant controller; Resonant controls; Single ended primary inductor converter (SEPIC); Unity power factor (UPF); Electric power system control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728156729,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The basic structure of sliding mode observer (SMO) includes a discontinuous signum function and low pass filter, which introduces not only chattering but also delay in the estimated position. To deal with the issue of classical SMO, RAPO consisting of sigmoid function based continuous super twisting SMO (CSTSMO) followed by a multi-layered fourth order generalized integrator (MFGI) is used for this purpose. The CSTSMO is robust and with continuous switching function, it provides results with less chattering. The MFGI filters out the lower order dominating harmonics and determines the fundamental signal, which helps in calculating accurate position and speed of PMSG.

The inescapable practice of social media has produced remarkable volumes of social data. Social media gathers the data in both structured-unstructured and formal-informal ways as users are not concerned with the exact grammatical structure and spelling when interacting with each other by means of various social networking websites (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.). People are increasingly involved in and dependent on social media networks for data, news and opinions of other handlers on a variety of topics. The strong dependence on social media network sites contributes to enormous data generation characterized by three issues: scale, noise, and variety. Such problems also hinder social network data to be evaluated manually, resulting in the correct use of statistical analytical methods. Mining social media data can extract significant patterns that can be advantageous for consumers, users, and business. Pattern mining offers a wide variety of methods to detect valuable knowledge from huge datasets, such as patterns, trends, and rules. In this work, data was collected comprised of users' opinions and sentiments and then processed using a significant number of pattern mining methods. The results were then further analyzed to attain meaningful information. The aim of this paper is to deliver a summary and a set of strategies for utilizing the ubiquitous pattern mining approaches, and to recognize the challenges and future research guidelines of dealing out social media data. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","classification; clustering; feature extraction; feature selection; pattern mining; pre-processing; Social media","Classification (of information); Data mining; Social networking (online); Clusterings; Features extraction; Features selection; Grammatical structure; Pattern mining; Pre-processing; Social datum; Social media; Social media datum; Social media networks; Feature extraction","Chaki, J.; School of Information Technology and Engineering, India; email: jyotismita.c@gmail.com",,"World Scientific",02184885,,IJUSF,,"English","Int.

To maximize power extraction from solar PV (Photovoltaic) panel, a learning-based hill climbing (L-HC) algorithm is implemented for a grid integrated solar PV system. For the testing, a three-phase system configuration based on 2-stage topology, and the deployed load on a common connection point (CCP) are considered. The L-HC MPPT algorithm is the modified version of HC (Hill Climbing) algorithm, where issues like, oscillation in steady-state condition and, slow response during dynamic change condition are mitigated. The AM-MKF is an advanced version of KF (Kalman Filter), where for optimal estimation in KF, an AM-M (Adaptive Maximize-M) concept is integrated. The key objective of the novel control strategy is to extract maximum power from the solar panel and to meet the demand of the load. After satisfying the load demand, the rest power is transferred to the grid. However, in the nighttime, the system is used for reactive power support, which mode of operation is known as a DSTATCOM (Distribution Static Compensator). The capability of developed control strategies, is proven through testing on a prototype. During experimentation, different adverse grid conditions, unbalanced load situation and variable solar insolation are considered. In these situations, the satisfactory performances of control techniques prove the effectiveness of the developed control strategy. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Adaptive Maximize-M Kalman Filter; DSTATCOM; Grid-Tied System; Power Quality; Solar PV Generation","Kalman filters; Optimization; Passive filters; Static synchronous compensators; Control strategies; Control techniques; Mode of operations; Optimal control technique; Optimal estimations; Reactive power support; Steady-state condition; Three phase system; Electric power transmission networks","Kumar, N.; Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Singapore; email: nishant.kumar1729@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15498328,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

EV charging may be accommodated while benefiting one or more of the stakeholders, i.e., the grid, the aggregator (service provider), and/or the driver. This article presents a profit maximization multiaggregator scheduling scheme, which encapsulates the benefits of the consumer while maximizing the profits of the aggregator in noncollaborative and collaborative scheduling. The manuscript proposes novel fuzzy inference based EV driver response indicator (EVDRI) for gauging the response of the EV driver to a particular scheduling. The EVDRI is dependent on parameters of charging time and cost. Penalties for low satisfaction, along with penalties for any EVs that remain unscheduled are also included in the profit calculation. Furthermore, the potential impact of EV routing on aggregator profits and driver's satisfaction is also explored. Results indicate that the user response is positive (greater satisfaction) in case of collaborative scheduling and with optimum routing. The developed fuzzy EVDRI (F-EVDRI) provides good indication of the satisfaction level of the drivers. Impact of different parameters is also explored on the F-EVDRI wherein charging duration was found to be the parameter that impacts the EVDRI. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","charging cost; charging scheduling; Collaborative (CoS) scheduling; driver response indicators (DRI); electric vehicle (EV); unscheduled penalty","Electric vehicles; Fuzzy inference; Profitability; Scheduling; Charging managements; Collaborative scheduling; Optimum routing; Potential impacts; Profit maximization; Scheduling schemes; Service provider; Vehicle drivers; Charging time","Gupta, V.; Vishu Gupta and Rajesh Kumar Are with the Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: vishu.gupta0607@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00939994,,ITIAC,,"English","IEEE Trans Ind Appl",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096038734

Two hundred subjects were classified into normal and abnormal using volumetric Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) acquisition. The images are normalized to obtain 12 useful slices to be considered as the patient feature set for classification. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used for feature extraction and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for feature selection. Various classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), CART (Classification and Regression Tree) and Random forest are tested. Applying K-fold cross validation in each train-test ratios, we obtained ceiling level classification accuracy with coherent sensitivity and specificity using only linear SVM (negating the use of PCA).

This paper presents that how the potential of Air Handling Unit (AHU) of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system can be utilized as a virtual source of an ancillary service by regulating it in real time according to its thermal load. Internet of Things (IoT) enabled real time controller is proposed where the thermal comfort of occupants is used as feedback to control the AHU fans. The key challenge corresponding to the AHU is, nonlinear torque characteristics of fan with respect to required air flow rate at a thermal load on AHU. To address this problem an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System is used to model the nonlinear property of the AHU fan. In this system it has two-part integration, IoT based controller and ANFIS based model with thermal model of building. To evaluate the algorithm, first, the reserved ancillary potential is calculated based on weekly class schedule. Secondly, it has been controlled in real time as per the thermal comfort of occupants to maximize the potential of ancillary service through the HVAC system. To analyze the response of the algorithm for a building, this set-up is scaled up at the level of AHU network installed in the lecture hall complex of an educational building in Delhi. The proposed algorithm has been tested and analyzed on an experimental set-up, synchronized with the thermal-dynamic model of building in MATLAB. It shows that there is a potential of ancillary service up to 97 kW in non-scheduled period and for the scheduled period it can be increased by 20% to 59% of available reserve power. © 2020","Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System; Ancillary services; Internet of Things","Air conditioning; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Internet of things; School buildings; Thermal comfort; Thermal load; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Air handling units; Educational buildings; Experimental set up; Heating ventilation and air conditioning; Internet of Things (IOT); Nonlinear properties; Real time controllers; HVAC","Kumar Yadav, M.; Centre for Energy Studies, Hauz Khas, India; email: manish.kumar.yadav@ces.iitd.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089095118

Mobility-aware scheduling is implemented, where the EV arrival at charging stations is modeled using a survey conducted for the city of Jaipur, India, to evaluate the travel patterns. A new approach for modeling the willingness of the consumer has been presented that evaluates the willingness based on scheduling parameters, which include the charging cost, the charging duration, and the arrival/scheduling time of the vehicle. A penalty function has also been developed for the inclusion of the customer willingness into the profit equation. Results indicate superior performance of decentralized scheduling (DES) as compared with CES.

The load profile attributes namely utilization and availability factors are derived as a function of load type and temporal characteristics of responsive loads. The proposed integrated approach uses the concept of conventional random willingness factors coupled with load profile attributes to resolve the ambiguity around customer/load behavior. The response of the customer to load profile attributes and the willingness factor is formulated using three different models, namely, linear, exponential, and nonlinear models. Further, to consider the nondeterministic and indistinct behavior of the customer, a fuzzy inference system (FIS) is developed to create a relationship between the load profile attributes and willingness to DR participation cost. Further, an online FIS membership function parameter tuning mechanism is developed to improve the performance of DR aggregator as well as overall day ahead market. The proposed approach is simulated for a combined price based scheduling of the generation company and the DR aggregator with responsive loads spread over various load sectors such as industrial, commercial, residential, agricultural, and the municipal sector. The simulation results of the online intelligent-integrated framework are compared to conventional willingness model, nonfuzzy, and untuned FIS models with and without considering load profile and customer willingness factor.

This study presents an operational strategy for PVassisted charging stations (PVCSs) that allows the EV to be charged primarily by PV energy, followed by the EV station's battery storage (BS) and the grid. Multi-Aggregator collaborative scheduling is considered that includes a monetary penalty on the aggregator for any unscheduled EVs.

Profit results are compared in cases of minimum, average and maximum PV energy output. The results indicate that the inclusion of penalties due to unscheduled EVs resulted in lowered profits.

The participation strategies of generation company include various objectives incorporating economic (profit maximization), environmental (emission minimization), and social (maximum load satisfaction) aspects. The total objective under single, dual and multi-constrained approaches is formulated along with appropriate constraints for energy, spinning reserve, and non-spinning reserve offerings in various markets. In addition, the impact of renewable energy participation in energy market on scheduling decisions of generation company in different markets is also examined. The renewable energy independent power producers namely wind energy and solar photovoltaic energy generators are considered in this study. The sensitivity analysis is also carried out to examine the impact of reserve deployment probability on optimal offerings and generation company surplus in energy as well as ancillary service markets. To solve the proposed framework, binary fireworks algorithm is used, considering the binary natured commitment problem of generation company’s thermal units. The simulation results of proposed framework tested using thermal units, wind energy independent power producer, solar photovoltaic independent power producer are presented for base case and various scenarios involving single, dual and multi objectives.

The proposed approach consists of a two stage procedure where dual objective problem is modeled to achieve both responsive load agent (RLA) economic benefits as well as distribution system operator (DSO) preferences. The two stage coordinated scheduling of RLAs with DSO network operation preferences is carried out by demand response aggregation agent (DRAA) through incentives. The cloud based information exchange between different stakeholders provides the necessary communication at different stages of responsive load scheduling. The concept of private, shared and community clouds are incorporated into the cyber physical cloud based DAM framework proposed in this work. The first stage scheduling of responsive loads is carried out by RLAs with electricity payment minimization objective looking into the tariff structure. Whereas, the second stage scheduling is carried out by DRAA in which incentives are offered to RLAs for the deviation from personalized schedules of first stage. The customer characterization and behavior (risk averse, incentive preferences etc.) of scheduling the responsive loads is considered through incentive range based clusters. The proposed DRAA coordinated DR scheduling framework is simulated using IEEE 37 bus distribution test system with commercial, residential and industrial sectors. The impact of stage 1 and stage 2 scheduling of responsive loads is analyzed with respect to system performance indices such as total operational cost, load factor, total network losses etc. The sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the impact of weightage assignment to DSO and RLA objectives on system performance aspects. The proposed DRAA coordinated two stage framework has shown considerable improvement in techno-economic aspects of responsive load scheduling in distribution network that can be appended to real world applications at distribution level/retail markets. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Demand response aggregator agent (DRAA); Demand side management (DSM); Distribution system operator (DSO); DR customer behavior; Moth–Flame optimization algorithm (MFOA); Responsive load agent (RLA)","Cyber Physical System; Demand side management; Digital instruments; Electric utilities; Housing; Sensitivity analysis; Customer behavior; Demand response; Distribution systems; Optimization algorithms; Responsive load; Scheduling","Srikanth Reddy, K.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: srikanthreddy@ee.iitd.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",0167739X,,FGCSE,,"English","Future Gener Comput Syst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028565289

This paper portrays a detailed study on the modeling of different HF modes and proposes a supervised undervoltage load-shedding scheme to further reduce the likelihood of cascading events caused by HFs. The proposed methodology uses two different probabilistic models of HFs to assess HFs' impact on cascading events. The proposed methodology is validated through numerous case studies on the IEEE 57-bus network. It is also observed that inclusion of self-monitoring and control features in digital relays significantly reduces the risk of wide-area blackouts.

Short-term load forecasting models enable prediction of future power consumption, thereby encouraging shifting of loads and optimizing the use of stochastic power sources and stored energy. To make the electric grid system smart and sustainable, two-way communication between the utility and consumers must be set up and the working equipment must respond digitally to the quickly changing electric demand. The proposed work exploits the power of embedded systems to design a low-cost solution for interconnecting electrical and electronic devices, controlled by the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. This work primarily focuses on implementing standard regression and machine learning-based architectures for smart grid load analysis and forecasting. A state of the art ecosystem for a portable load forecasting device is proposed by means of low-cost, open-source hardware that is experimentally found to be functioning with a high degree of accuracy. Further, the performance of the classical and advanced machine learning models, emulated on the device, are analyzed on the basis of various parameters, including error percentage, execution time, CPU core temperatures, and resource utilization.

In the initial phase, brain images are classified into three categories namely, normal, Low-Grade Glioma (LGG) and High-Grade Glioma (HGG) based on the availability of tumor. The proposed methodology is examined on Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2019 challenge database. The tumor detection task is performed on VGG-19 transfer learning model. On the VGG-19 transfer learning model at epoch 6, training data yield 99.82% training accuracy, 96.32% validation accuracy and 99.30% testing accuracy. The obtained specificity is 100% and sensitivity is 97.81%, and Area Under Curve (AUC) is 0.99.

Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare systems is now emerging solution for modern e-healthcare system to provide high quality medical care. In this research work, we proposed a novel method which utilizes a modified vesselness measurement and a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to identify the oral cancer region structure in IoT based smart healthcare system. The robust vesselness filtering scheme handles noise while reserving small structures, while the CNN framework considerably improves classification accuracy by deblurring focused region of interest (ROI) through integrating with multi-dimensional information from feature vector selection step. The marked feature vector points are extracted from each connected component in the region and used as input for training the CNN. During classification, each connected part is individually analysed using the trained DCNN by considering the feature vector values that belong to its region. For a training of 1500 image dataset, an accuracy of 96.8% and sensitivity of 92% is obtained. Hence, the results of this work validate that the proposed algorithm is effective and accurate in terms of classification of oral cancer region in accurate decision making.

A crucial step in dehazing is the recovery of the global air-light vector. Traditional methods usually interpret the RGB value of the brightest region in haze images as the air-light. In this letter, a new prior called 'color constancy prior' has been proposed to improve the robustness of air-light estimation when varicolored illumination exists. The prior utilizes the statistical observation that distant scenery objects become the most haze-opaque due to the pixel escalation towards the higher intensity side.

Oral and neck cancer is one of the rampant forms of cancer and this cancer is mostly experienced by socio-economic backward population. The hyperspectral image analysis is emerging as a non-invasive method for classification of cancer. Due to dearth of modern digital tool for computer-aided classification and pre-detection of cancer cells, we have proposed a Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) and SVM classification fusion for learning and classifying the pre- and post-cancerous tissue and normal tissue from the hyperspectral imaging. The mixed pixel from background is projected for cancerous region detection. The result of a patient hypercube is presented for the validation of deep learning technique pixel-wise probability map of cancerous and normal healthy tissues on hyperspectral imaging. Moreover, we have obtained a classifier accuracy of 94.75% by classifier fusion by majority voting as compared to conventional classification using the deep learning method imaging technique in hyperspectral image.

A soft switching adaptive sliding mode observer (SSA-SMO) is used for wind energy conversion system (WECS) interfaced to the grid. The SSA-SMO is used as back electromotive force estimator of permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) during the estimation of rotor position and speed. Unlike the traditional SMO, this observer replaces the discontinuous signum function with hyperbolic tangent function for smooth operation and chattering reduction. With the knowledge of prevailing stable condition, the observer gains are tuned online. Moreover, precise estimation of rotor position and speed, is achieved with reduced steady state error. A soft switching higher order sliding mode controller (SS-HOSMC), is used for adapting the shaft speed according to the incident wind speed, which confirms the optimum wind energy production at variable wind speed. This SS-HOSMC is robust as well as contributes in chattering reduction. Field oriented control (FOC) is used for implementing machine side converter control, whereas a simple phase locked loop (PLL) less control is implemented for dealing with power quality issues and DC link voltage regulation, which is requisite need for power flow from wind generator to the grid.

The multi-leg bridgeless converter provides a higher utilization of input energy with a reduction in electromagnetic interference (EMI). The proposed configuration is more robust towards frequent parameter variation as the high-frequency converter leg reduces the requirement of large passive components. An adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) has been introduced for faster dynamical control during grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) with diverged distribution grid conditions. The ASMC provides a better dynamical response as the tracking error is confined within the pre-defined sliding surface during an abrupt change in adaptive gain variation. The proposed control action virtually eliminates the proportional-integral (PI) controller to address more nonlinearities during the EV charging operation. A MATLAB SIMULINK model is developed to study the various dynamical response of the converter and proposed control action. A hardware laboratory prototype is also designed for a 3.3 kW EV charger to validate the desired character with the improvement of the source-end power factor during active power exchange in the G2V mode of operation. © 2020 IEEE.","Adaptive sliding mode control; Bi-directional EV charging multi-leg interleaved converter","Control nonlinearities; Disturbance rejection; Electromagnetic pulse; Fast charging (Batteries); Frequency converters; Power converters; Power electronics; Sliding mode control; Two term control systems; Vehicle-to-grid; Vehicles; Virtual addresses; Adaptive sliding mode control; Bridgeless converters; Dynamical response; Grid to vehicle (G2V); High frequency converter; Matlab Simulink models; Proportional integral controllers; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Electric power transmission networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728142517,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Here, a novel LLMLF algorithm is developed for active component extraction from load current, and a novel LPO MPPT algorithm is developed for optimal MPPT operation. The proposed LPO is the improved form of perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm, where inherent problems of traditional P&O algorithm like steady-state oscillation, slow dynamic responses, and fixed step size issues are successfully mitigated. The prime objective of proposed LLMLF control is to fulfill the active power requirement of the loads from generated solar PV power, and excess power is fed to the grid. However, when generated PV power is less than the required load power, then LLMLF fulfills the load by taking extra required power from the grid. During this process, power quality is improved at the grid. The controller action provides reactive power compensation, power factor correction, harmonics filtering, and mitigation of other power quality issues. Moreover, when the solar irradiation is zero, then the dc link capacitor and voltage source converter act as distribution static compensator, which enhances the utilization factor of the system. The proposed techniques are modeled and their performances are verified experimentally on a developed prototype, in solar insolation variation condition, imbalance loading condition for linear/nonlinear loads, as well as in different grid disturbances such as over-voltage, under-voltage, phase imbalance, harmonics distortion in the grid voltage etc., where it has shown a very good performance. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","DSTATCOM; grid integrated; leaky least mean logarithmic fourth control; power quality; Solar PV array","Electric power transmission networks; Maximum power point trackers; Photovoltaic cells; Power control; Power quality; Quality control; Reactive power; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Static synchronous compensators; DSTATCOM; grid integrated; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Power factor corrections; Reactive power compensation; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar PV arrays; Voltage source converters; Electric power system control","Kumar, N.; Electrical Engineering, India; email: nishant.kumar1729@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",19493029,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

The proposed controller provides a stable operation during a wide variation in power demand from either side of the distribution grid or plug-in EV (PEV). The current controller plays a crucial role during bi-direction fast charging operation and the requirement of an adaptive dynamic controller is inevitable in achieving variable reference current perturbation. The proposed controller operation is guaranteed with faster convergence during variable reference tracking within a wide range of operation. The parameter variation including the unmodelled input current disturbance during the fast charging operation of the PEV is well addressed by the implementation of proposed dynamic gain adjustment technique. The gain adaptation by the controller is designed to provide a better transient performance by providing an additional sliding surface error minimization technique. The unity power factor operation is also ensured to improve the grid power quality during PEV charging operation from a single-phase distribution grid.

Such scenarios can be avoided by including dynamic constraints in the optimization problem in the form of voltage stability, small signal stability, transient stability, etc. Transient stability constrained optimal power flow (TSC-OPF) is proposed in this paper to compute dispatch for different generators economically. The proposed TSC-OPF reshuffle generation of machines by withdrawing dispatch from critical machines (threatening the system security) and economically distributing them among non-critical machines. This generation reshuffling is based on deviated normalized kinetic energy of individual machine from the mean value of normalized kinetic energy of all machines in the system at the instant of instability.

Most of the classification techniques use only dimension reduction and depends on reference method. In this research, we merged both spectral and spatial characteristics information's about classification of mixed pixel image was presented. First, we perform training in the standard cancerous image dataset. Then proposed a deep classification architecture framework based on the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based ResNet architecture of cancer region detection.

To verify the performance of designed ResNet based CNN network, we calculated the performance index like accuracy, training time and classification error for detecting region of interest calcification.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) in SG, is used for the effective monitoring and controlling of the electric- ity consumption by the end users and is considered as one of the core components of SG. However, AMI is susceptible to various types of cyber-attacks, as it consists of components which are vulnerable to various types of attacks in SG. Therefore physical layer security becomes the important aspect in SG. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we present Low Density parity check (LDPC) coding scheme for the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel to improve the security at physical layer used in AMI for bidirectional data transfer between meter and SG. Specifically, we designed the scheme for securing the wireless communication channel in AMI from the eavesdropping attack. The proposed scheme is efficient as it minimizes the Bit Error Rate (BER) at the legitimate receiver to lower values of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), thus making it difficult for an eavesdropper to listen and to modify the data transmission taking place bi- directionally. Moreover, it significantly reduces the usage of SNR, which leads to low power consumption. Numerical analysis shows that 25% and 41% improvements are observed in SNR using our proposed scheme as compared to the existing schemes i.e., hamming coded and uncoded data transmission. © 2019 IEEE.","AWGN wiretap channel; Bit Error Rate; LDPC codes; Physical Layer Security; Smart Grid; SNR","Advanced metering infrastructures; Bit error rate; Channel coding; Data transfer; Electric power transmission networks; Gaussian noise (electronic); Network security; Physical layer; Signal receivers; Smart power grids; White noise; Additive white Gaussian noise channel; LDPC codes; Low density parity check coding; Monitoring and controlling; Physical layer security; Smart grid; Wire-tap channels; Wireless communication channels; Signal to noise ratio",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728109602,,,"English","IEEE Globecom Workshops, GC Wkshps - Proc.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082300840

During FC extraction, GDLSR-based NN structure attenuates harmonic components, noise, dc offsets, bias, notches and distortions from the nonlinear current, which improves the power quality under normal as well as under abnormal grid conditions. This single-layer GDLSR-based NN structure has a very simple architecture, which decreases the computational burden and algorithm complexity. Therefore, it is easy in implementation.

The same is intended to minimize the limitations of price-based and incentive-based mechanisms. However, unlike the price-based or incentive-based DR schemes, the DR sellers in DRX do not have a clear motivation to formulate the bid offers. Similarly, the DR buyers' bid formulation should also include optimal benefit analysis. This paper formulates and analyzes the bid formulation for DR sellers and buyers considering respective operation objectives. The DR seller bid formulation is derived considering load behavior through utilization index and availability index obtained from load profile of respective loads. On the other hand, DR buyer bid formulation is derived from power exchange operation attributes/cost of generation. Therefore, the DR clearing ultimately affects the operational cost of operation which, in turn, is reflected in DR buying bid and DR clearing finally. This paper develops an iterative approach in which the continuous interactions between ISO/power exchange would finally converge to a stable operation. The load profile-based strategic bid formulation is modeled using mathematical as well as fuzzy inference system (FIS). In addition, an adaptive FIS has been devised to improve the performance of DR scheduling. The simulation results illustrate the impact of customer behavior, intelligent decision-making, and penetration level on the performance and convergence of power markets (DRX and power exchange). © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Customer baseline load; demand response; demand response exchange; energy markets; independent system operator; load profiling","Commerce; Decision making; Electric utilities; Fuzzy inference; Sales; Customer baseline loads; Demand response; Demand response exchanges; Energy markets; Independent system operators; Load profiling; Power markets","Konda, S.R.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, United Arab Emirates; email: srikanthkonda.eee@gmail.com",,"IEEE Computer Society",15513203,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

The OASC is an adaptive control alongside exhibiting robustness against uncertainties (structured and unstructured). The objective of peak wind power extraction is met through cascaded control, which includes an inner hysteresis current control and an outer speed control based on OASC. The proposed OASC includes a disturbance observer loop with backstepping control. Moreover, it incorporates a discontinuous projection law-based adaptive parameter estimation, thereby resulting in a sense of hybrid control implementation. The outer speed control loop provides the reference stator current to the inner loop retaining maximum power point tracking. For enhancement of system reliability, another renewable source (solar PV array) is integrated at the dc link. The connection between the hybrid system and the grid is established through an inverter incorporating the proposed MAF-based control. Herein, the effects of nonlinear balanced and unbalanced loads are addressed through the incorporation of vectorial approach for extracting fundamental positive sequence components from nonlinear load currents to realize harmonic-free fundamental reference currents for the grid.

The objective of the IEDs is to successfully transmit their messages within a specified time, whereas the jammer wants to obstruct IED's transmission. A novel utility function is designed for the players, that addresses the time-critical nature of communication. Due to the conflicting interest of the IEDs and the jammer, they model the interaction between them as a repeated Bayesian zero-sum game, which also addresses the repeated interaction among the IEDs and the jammer, and the unavailability of exact information about the jammer.

This very aim is achieved through PMSG speed control using an observer based nonlinear control (ONC) implemented on the wind turbine side converter (WSC), which gets its switching pulses from vector control. The PMSG output power regulation relies on its stator current control, which is attained through PMSG speed tracking. At different wind speed profiles, the PMSG tracks the reference speed decided through MPP tracking algorithm. The design of nonlinear control is based on predicting the response of the system over a horizon of finite time. As the nonlinear control alone is incapable of dealing with the effects of uncertainties, an observer design is included for this very purpose. Hence, the proposed ONC is equipped with the concepts of speed tracking in conjunction with disturbance observation and antiwindup compensation. For control implementation and performance verification, an estimation logic is employed for estimating the PMSG speed, which includes additional benefits like reduced weight, cost and complexity. The test system with the proposed ONC is simulated and results are discussed.

Dynamic stressed conditions often lead to cascading outages. Distance relays are quite vulnerable to maloperations during these stressed conditions. Under such circumstances, the apparent impedance seen by the relays might encroach into the third zone and can cause maloperations. Moreover, under such conditions, generators experiencing stable power swings might also move to an out of step condition in subsequent stages. The objective of this paper is to develop a technique that not only differentiates the stressed conditions from faulted ones but further identifies if the system is approaching into an out of step condition. It suggests a Decision Tree-based logic that prevents the third zone of distance relay from maloperating and assists the system engineer to initiate remedial action schemes or restrain any unintentional islanding. Simulations were performed for two systems: WSCC 9 bus system and IEEE 39 bus system using the Power Factory-DIgSILENT simulation software tool. The performance of the proposed scheme has been further validated using real-time simulation tool (Opal-RT 5600).

However, the sparseness of these networks is an inherent characteristic that is known to be a bottleneck. The main objective of this work was to provide an alternative solution for the intermittently connected FANET by considering the philosophy of the Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) approach. To realize the functionality of the DTN protocols in a three-dimensional (3D) space, a social FANET model is proposed. FANET nodes are supposed to have a sparse node density. Fundamentally, the proposed DTN assisted Flying Ad hoc Network exploits the DTN routing and mobility features. The new mobility modeling for 3D spaces was re-engineered and tested with well-known routing protocols to analyze the performance of the model based on node speed, density, buffer, latency, message overhead, and power consumption. The effectiveness of 3D mobility models has also been compared against the one of classical models.

To deal with the effect of intermittent nature of wind, this paper presents the design and implementation of a composite sliding mode controller (CSMC) for a battery energy storage (BES) supported solar photovoltaic (PV)-wind hybrid system in a remote location. This control technique comprises of a soft-switching sliding-mode observer (SS-SMO) and a nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller (NTSMC). The SS-SMO is used to observe the disturbances, whereas the NTSMC is used as a speed controller. The chattering problem caused by the conventional sliding mode controller is alleviated by replacing the conventional signum switching function with the smooth hyperbolic tangent function in disturbance observer loop. The fast and finite time convergence NTSMC based speed controller along with the SS-SMO based disturbance rejection unit, serves the benefits of CSMC. This technique exhibits robustness against model uncertainties and external disturbances.

This has added to the volatility of the grid supply. As a result, there is a necessity to provide better regulation resources to the grid in order to meet the reliability and security requirements of the grid power. This has paved way for using responsive loads as a resources due to several benefits which load characteristics offer in this regard. This work aims at developing an optimal load control strategy to regulate bus voltages through buildings which are an aggregation of flexible loads. A linearized sensitivity based regulation signal has been computed for obtaining voltage support from buildings. A suitable strategy has been developed to modify the building load and optimally dispatch the building energy storage systems (ESS) to cater to the grid voltage regulation requirement. The developed strategy has been tested with a building heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system which demonstrates the change in room temperature in accordance with the regulation signals. The control strategy has been tested on modified IEEE 4-bus test feeder.

Here three-phase single-stage topology of a grid-integrated PV system is used for feeding the nonlinear/linear load at the point of common coupling. A single layer neuron structure is used for active load component (ALC) extraction from distorted load current. During ALC extraction, PNKLMF-NN control very precisely attenuates harmonics components, noise, dc offset, bias, notches, and distortions from the nonlinear current, which improves the power quality under normal as well as under abnormal conditions. This single layer PNKLMF-NN control has a very simple architecture, which reduces the computational burden and complexity. Therefore, it is easy in implementation. Moreover, proposed L-HC is the improved form of hill climbing (HC) algorithm, where inherent problems of traditional HC algorithm, such as steady-state oscillation, slow dynamic responses, and fixed step size issues, are successfully mitigated. The prime objective of proposed PNKLMF-NN control is to meet the active power requirement of the loads from generated solar PV power and excess power fed into the grid. However, when generated PV power is less than the required load power, then PNKLMF-NN control meets the load by taking extra required power from the grid. During these processes, power quality is maintained at the grid. Moreover, when solar irradiation is zero, voltage source converter (VSC) acts as distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM), which enhances the utilization factor of the system. The proposed techniques are modeled and their performances are verified experimentally on a developed g prototype in adverse conditions, which test results have satisfied the objectives of the proposed system and the IEEE-519 standard. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Distribution static compensator (dstatcom); Grid-tied system; Power normalized kernel least mean fourth (pnklmf); Power quality; Solar photovoltaic (pv)","Distributed power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Extraction; Maximum power point trackers; Neural networks; Power quality; Quality control; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Static synchronous compensators; Distribution static compensator; Grid-tied system; Least mean fourth; Least mean fourth algorithms; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar photovoltaics; Voltage source converters; Electric power system control","Kumar, N.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: nishant.kumar1729@gmail.com",,"IEEE Computer Society",15513203,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Thus, rainfall prediction is highly desirable for livelihood and sustainability. In this study, northeast monsoon rainfall (NEMR) is predicted over the Indian peninsular region for the months of October, November, and December using a global sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly as a predictor by linear regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), and extreme learning machine (ELM) techniques. The predictions are made by LR, ANN, and ELM models for the period 1990–2016 using the training input (1871–1989) of different time series samples of global SST anomaly data collected from Hadley Centre SST data set (HadSST3). Principal component analysis was used for dimensionality reduction of the data sets, and its application substantially improved the predictive ability of the machine learning techniques. The performance of the PC-ELM technique with the ensemble method (ESM 8–9) training window is found to be more accurate than the LR and ANN techniques and provides minimal error scores as per the statistical analysis.

Interactions among proteins are complex and large. Proteins separations are challenging process in molecular biology. Computational tools help to simulate the analysis in order to reduce the training data into small testing data. Large proteins have been mapped using self-organizing maps (SOMs). Neural network based SOMs has a significant role in reducing the irregular shapes of proteins interactions. Iterative checking enables the organizations of all proteins. In next stage, particle swarm intelligence is applied to classify the proteins’ families. In the current work, secondary (Two dimensional) and tertiary proteins (Three dimensional) proteins have been grouped. Two dimensional proteins contain fewer hydro-carbons than three dimensional proteins. For faster analysis, the angles of the proteins are taken into account. The SOMs is compared with Bounding Box approach. In final, the experimental evolutions show that swarm intelligence achieved faster processing through enabling less memory consumptions and time. Since PSO combines proteins datasets in fuzzy values, the compactness or integration of similar proteins are strong. On the other hand, Bounding Box uses the Crisp value. Therefore, it needs more space to organize the whole data. Without SOMs, swarm intelligence also results are poor due to the excessive time consuming and required storage area. Moreover, for almost all classification and clustering tools, it is observed that the overall classification task becomes slow, time consuming, space consuming and also less sensitive because of noises, irrelevant data in input datasets. Thus, the proposed SOM based PSO approach achieved less time consuming with efficient classification into secondary and tertiary proteins. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Bounding box; Proteins; Self-organizing map; Swarm intelligence; Tertiary proteins","Classification (of information); Conformal mapping; Digital storage; Molecular biology; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Self organizing maps; Swarm intelligence; Bounding box; Classification and clustering; Classification tasks; Computational tools; Experimental evolution; Irregular shape; Self organizing maps(soms); Self-organizing mapping; Proteins","Ashour, A.S.; Department of Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering, Egypt; email: amirasashour@yahoo.com",,"Springer Verlag",18688071,,,,"English","Intl.

In the deregulated market, electricity is treated as an entity unlike in the traditional vertically integrated market model where it is treated as a service provided by the generation companies (GENCOs). The task of GENCO is to perform self-scheduling of available units so as to achieve maximum profit in restructured power sector. Therefore, the problem of profit based unit commitment (PBUC) in deregulated markets can be formulated as a commitment and generation allocation through self-scheduling procedure. The commitment schedule optimization, i.e whether the status of a thermal unit is to be changed to on or off state, is a binary problem. Thus, the PBUC problem requires binary optimization for commitment and real valued optimization for generation allocation. In this paper, three binary grey wolf optimizer (BGWO) models are presented to solve the profit based self-scheduling problem of GENCO. The BGWO models proposed in this paper differ with respect to the transformation function used to map real valued wolf position into a binary variable. The binary mapping of commitment status is carried out using sigmoid and tangent hyperbolic transfer functions. Also, in the sigmoidal transfer function, two binary transformation procedures, namely crossover and conventional sigmoidal transfer function, are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed models in improving the solution quality of PBUC problem is examined using two test systems, a 3 unit and a 10 unit test system. In addition, two cases of GENCO market participation with and without reserve market participation are simulated. In the test case with reserve market participation, two commonly used reserve payment models are examined. Simulation results are presented and compared to existing approaches that have been used to solve the PBUC problem. The simulation results and statistical analysis demonstrate the improved solution quality (profit or fitness value) of the PBUC problem and statistical significance of the BGWO models with respect to solution quality obtained as compared to other established meta-heuristic approaches. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Binary grey wolf optimizer (BGWO); Constrained optimization; Electricity market; Meta-heuristic optimization; Nature inspired optimization; Profit base unit commitment (PBUC)","Commerce; Constrained optimization; Deregulation; Electric industry; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Hyperbolic functions; Power markets; Problem solving; Profitability; Scheduling; Transfer functions; Grey Wolf Optimizer; Meta-heuristic optimizations; Power system operational planning; Profit based unit commitment; Profit Based Unit Commitment (PBUC); Statistical significance; Transformation functions; Unit-commitment; Electric power system planning","Reddy K, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: srikanthkonda.eee@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",22106502,,,,"English","Swarm Evol.

In their usage of the electrophysiological recordings, most of the proposals thus far have followed the conventional practise of employing all frequency bands following signal decomposition as input features for a classifier. Although seemingly powerful, this approach may prove counterproductive since some frequency bins may not carry relevant information about seizure episodes and may, instead, add noise to the classification process thus degrading performance. A key thesis of the work described here is that the selection of frequency subsets may enhance seizure classification rates. Additionally, the authors explore whether a conservative selection of frequency bins can reduce the amount of training data needed for achieving good classification performance. They have found compelling evidence that using spectral components with <25 Hz frequency in scalp electroencephalograms can yield state-of-the-art classification accuracy while reducing training data requirements to just a tenth of those employed by current approaches. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Synchronised voltage angle measurements procured from the installed phasor measurement units in the network have been used to devise an index for assessment of transient stability in the system. The behaviour of the trend of the acceleration at the instant of the critical clearing angle has been used in this study as the basis for differentiating between a stable and an unstable power swing. Upon detection of an unstable condition, the generator, which is most likely to be going out of step is detected, and appropriate control action is suggested for mitigating the predicted out of step condition. Moreover, the distance relay maloperations caused during a stable power swing can also be a reason for triggering cascading outages. Suitable remedial measures to avoid such maloperations of the distance relay have been proposed.

This phenomena of unwanted relay operation is termed as sympathetic tripping. For appropriate relay operation, issue of sympathetic tripping is required to be considered while addressing relay coordination problem. This paper proposes a phase fault protection scheme, which mitigates the issue of sympathetic tripping in the meshed network. The undesired relay operation in the network is restricted by imposing some additional constraints on the conventional relay coordination problem. The proposed nonlinear optimization problem is solved by using Shannon-Wiener differential evolution algorithm. Procured optimal relay settings will provide efficient protection against each phase fault without causing sympathetic tripping. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is examined on modified IEEE-8-bus system, IEEE-14-bus system, and IEEE-30-bus system.

These uncertainties arise due to nonlinearity, disturbances or unbalanced loads. A three-phase grid-integrated solar photovoltaic (PV) system incorporating a control technique based on a modified decorrelation normalized least mean square (DNLMS) algorithm, aiming to enhance its overall performance under adverse conditions, is presented in this work. The three-phase, grid-tied, single-stage solar PV system comprises a solar PV array with a suitable maximum power point tracking method, filters, loads, and a capacitor fed voltage source converter (VSC). The key objective of the solar PV integrated structure with an adaptive law based control algorithm is to attain a unity power factor (UPF) at the grid end ensuring harmonics mitigation from the grid currents. Moreover, this structure effectively transfers active power from the PV array to the local loads and the grid. These aforesaid objectives are achieved through providing controlled switching pulses to the insulated gate bipolar transistor based VSC using the modified DNLMS control algorithm with fast convergence rate. Harmonics-free, sinusoidal reference grid currents, are obtained by using the modified DNLMS algorithm.

Integration of renewable and clean energy resources either in the transmission or distribution systems require effective control strategy for system operation and stability. This work presents a robust control strategy for a Voltage Source Converter (VSC) interfacing an integrated system comprising of Photo-Voltaic (PV) array and a battery unit with grid. Such a system is associated with intermittent output power and uncertain demand of the PV and load units, respectively. In order to make the control strategy robust to the power exchange through the point of common coupling (PCC), a new control design of VSC is proposed and theoretically validated. Detailed Lyapunov synthesis has been done to design a control strategy so that the system experiences stable DC link voltage despite of external disturbances. Extensive simulation studies have been carried out to ensure robust tracking performance and system stability against disturbance seen at the PCC. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Electric fault currents; Energy resources; Power converters; Robust control; System stability; Voltage regulators; Back-stepping controls; Control strategies; Distribution systems; Extensive simulations; External disturbances; Integrated systems; Point of common coupling; Voltage source converters; Control system synthesis",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538661598,,,"English","Natl.

This information helps in reducing the search space to the PZ corresponding to the generator bus with highest GIM following a fault. This area is termed as a vulnerable protection zone (VPZ). Once the VPZ is identified, positive-sequence voltage magnitudes of each bus within the VPZ are monitored to locate the bus closest to the fault (BCF).

The IWEGS consists of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), two voltage sourced converters (VSCs) connected back to back, working as machine side VSC (MSVSC) and load side VSC (LSVSC). The MSVSC is responsible for controlling the generated wind power using vector control scheme that uses a speed control unit to regulate its torque. Because of the robustness of the SMOC, it is used to control the speed of the PMSG in the presence of uncertainties in modelling and disturbance that occurs due to variable wind speed. The convergence speed of SMOC, is improved by using a modified reaching law in order to reduce the torque ripple. The LSVSC uses a voltage control scheme that regulates the voltage at common coupling point. The wind exhibits an irregular behavior, thereby requiring a reserve power source for meeting the load demand. An integration of BES improves the system reliability by meeting the excess power required by the load. Moreover, the BES absorbs the surplus power when the demand is not enough. Hence, an uninterrupted power supply is maintained ensuring the overall system utilization. A prototype of PMSG based IWEGS is developed in the laboratory. The control techniques are tested under variable speeds and varying loading conditions. © 2018 IEEE","Isolated wind energy generating system; Permanent magnet synchronous generator; Sliding mode controller","Permanent magnets; Robust control; Sliding mode control; Speed; Uncertainty analysis; Vector control (Electric machinery); Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Battery energy storages (BES); Generating system; Permanent magnet synchronous generator; Permanent Magnet Synchronous generator (PMSG); Sliding mode controller; Uninterrupted power supply; Vector control scheme; Voltage sourced converters; Synchronous generators",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538645369,,,"English","IEEE Ind.

Contingencies such as generator outage, line outage, and line fault can induce stressed system condition. Under stressed conditions, protection logic should be more biased toward security. Phasor measurement unit information is used at the system protection centre to estimate the system state. A data-mining model known as random forest is utilized to accomplish the task of state assessment. Two different protection logics are used to make the final relaying decision. The first protection logic is the existing distance relay and the second protection logic is based on wide area information. Both the protection logics are connected though logic gates to make the final relaying decision. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated on the IEEE-39 bus New England system and 246-bus Indian Northern Regional Power Grid system.

The proposed performance indices are coupled to unit commitment procedure through intelligent scheduling methodology considering both economic and environmental concerns of the system. The proposed models can be readily integrated into the unit commitment algorithm using the test system data and fuel composition. The same provides a simple and near appropriate model to consider resource sensitivity as compared to detailed (or) dedicated modeling carried out in Aspen, APEA, promax etc. The impact of resource sensitivity and scheduling strategy has been illustrated using a 10 unit thermal generation test system with amine based post combustion carbon capture technology. The resource sensitivity of the model has been demonstrated using three different compositions of fuel/coal viz. sub-bituminous, bituminous and lignite coals.

Moreover, for maximum power point tracking (MPPT), a new 'normal harmonic search' (NHS) algorithm is used, and for voltage source converter (VSC) control, a novel 'power normalized kernel least mean square' (PNKLMS) algorithm is proposed. The PNKLMS algorithm is used for active load component extraction from the load current, even when the load current is characterized by linear or nonlinear behavior. Moreover, PNKLMS algorithm is used for reference grid current generation. The NHS algorithm is an improved version of the harmony search, which is inspired to the music composition technique and its searching ability is improved by using the normal probability distribution factor. Therefore, NHS reaches the global maximum power point very quickly and is suitable for online searching on hardware. Moreover, the extracted power is fed into the grid. For control of VSC, the proposed PNKLMS control technique is used, which maintains the power quality. The performances of NHS-based MPPT and PNKLMS-based control technique with reduced sensor approach are tested on a developed prototype. The satisfactory steady-state and dynamic performances of the NHS algorithm are demonstrated under variable irradiance and temperature during partial shaded conditions. Moreover, the performances of the PNKLMS algorithm, without using dc-link voltage sensor are demonstrated during overvoltage, undervoltage, harmonics distortion, and load nonlinearity condition, results of which have satisfied the objective of the proposed system and the IEEE-519 standard. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Maximum power point tracking (MPPT); normal harmonic search (NHS); partial shaded condition; power normalized kernel least mean square (PNKLMS); power quality; single phase grid; solar energy conversion","Bandpass filters; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; Harmonic analysis; Heuristic algorithms; Maximum power point trackers; Power quality; Probability distributions; Quality control; Solar cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Switches; Kernel; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Normal probability distributions; Partial Shaded Condition; PNKLMS; Single phase; Steady-state and dynamic performance; VSC (voltage source converter); Computer music","Kumar, N.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: nishant.kumar1729@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00939994,,ITIAC,,"English","IEEE Trans Ind Appl",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049663602

It has the capability to synchronize with the utility as well as with the diesel generator (DG) set. During healthy grid condition at high renewable power generation and when load demand is less, it feeds power to the grid while at low renewable generation power is taken from the grid. During outage and low renewable power generation, it synchronizes with the DG set to meet the load demand and forms a hybrid microgrid. In islanding, the voltage source converter (VSC) operates in a voltage control mode for realizing a renewable MG and operates in the current control mode for implementing a hybrid MG and switching to the grid-connected mode. An incremental conductance and perturb & observe approaches with a boost converter are implemented for the maximum power extraction of the renewables. A battery bank is connected at the dc link of VSC. The multifunctional MG synchronization and de-synchronization with ac mains/DG set are discussed in conjunction with variety of test results. In this topology, a single bidirectional converter is implemented and controlled using various control algorithms to manage MG power among generation, storage, and load units.

Techniques like perfusion used for analysis of tumors are time taking, therefore, there is increased focus towards automated computational techniques to segment and grade tumors using standard MR sequences like T1 and T2 weighted images. These are intensity based images and are not enough to grade tumors, thus, are not used in clinical practice. This work automates tumor segmentation without the use of templates and training sets, by using vertical symmetry comparison. Once the tumor is segmented, fuzzy c means clustering is used on T1 and T2 maps, that are generated by using three intensity based sequences namely T1, T2 and proton density (PD) fat saturated images, for tumor grading. The clustered sections are compared with cerebral blood volume (CBV) images that are obtained by perfusion parameters to find correlation. 15 patients, 5 each from 4th, 3rd and 2nd grade tumor categories, were tested. Some correlation is seen between T1, T2 map values of tumor region and CBV values showing that this area can be explored further for tumor grading. © 2018 IEEE.","fuzzy c means clustering; MRI; T1 weighted; tumor gradation","Brain mapping; Fuzzy systems; Grading; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Cerebral Blood Volume(CBV); Clinical practices; Computational technique; Fuzzy C means clustering; Non-invasive technology; T1-weighted; T2-weighted images; Tumor segmentation; Tumors",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538630457,,,"English","Int.

However, intermittent nature of wind energy makes resource scheduling aspect of system operator more complex. The emerging deregulation policies have added to the complexity of scheduling problem. Therefore, treating and scheduling of wind energy on deterministic basis would result in non-optimal energy dispatch and increased operation cost over scheduling horizon. This paper focuses on optimal scheduling methodology of wind energy in day ahead market (DAM) considering expected costs due to wind uncertainty in real time (RT) spot market under deregulated market structure. This paper introduces various possible costs, namely, spot market compensation cost, additional reserve cost and rescheduling cost applicable to deviation in scheduled power from DAM to spot market. The costs can be derived from front-end information of DAM, historical and statistical estimate of RT market conditions. The effectiveness of proposed methodology is examined using IEEE 30 bus system with thermal and wind energy generators. In addition, sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the effect of incentive margin on DAM scheduling.

The generation uncertainties and outages considered for conventional generation facility is expressed using geometric distribution to include temporal characteristics of generation outage rate. The problem is formulated as an operational cost minimization problem. The efficacy of the proposed dynamic balancing cost approach is verified using various levels of uncertainty.

A three-phase, double stage, grid tied solar photovoltaic based distributed generating (SPVDG) system fulfilling multiple objectives, is presented using an adaptive digital disturbance estimator (DDE) and a peak power tracking scheme. The adaptive DDE has the detection proficiency of all the harmonics and lumped disturbances resulting fundamental component estimation of the periodic signals such as grid voltages and load currents. This system deals with objectives such as reactive power compensation, load balancing, peak solar power extraction, operation at grid voltage sags and swells, estimation of harmonics, dc offsets, disturbances, etc. and their elimination. Moreover, this system ensures the active power flow from the SPVDG system to the local loads as well as the grid through a three-phase voltage source converter (VSC). An adaptive technique is used to adjust the dc-link voltage with respect to the grid voltage variation(s) that is advantageous in terms of losses in the VSC. A Lyapunov function candidate is considered to estimate the gains of the disturbance estimator confirming its parameter convergence. Considering the aforementioned objectives, SPVDG system with the proposed DDE-based control scheme, is simulated using Matlab/Simulink environment and then practically implemented using a prototype developed in the laboratory to confirm its performance under steady and dynamic conditions. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Digital disturbance estimator (DDE); maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique; power quality; second order generalized integrator (SOGI); solar photovoltaic based distributed generating (SPVDG) system; synchronization; total harmonics distortion (THD); voltage source converter (VSC)","Distributed power generation; Electric frequency control; Electric load flow; Harmonic analysis; Lyapunov functions; Power quality; Reactive power; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Synchronization; Disturbance estimator; Secondorder generalized integrator (SOGI); SPVDG System; Total harmonics distortions; Voltage Source Converter (VSC); Electric power transmission networks","Pradhan, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: subarni89@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00939994,,ITIAC,,"English","IEEE Trans Ind Appl",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047639787

Among the various scientific approaches, statistical, empirical, and numerical modeling are popular and widely used in the recent time for monsoon forecast, whereas for some reason soft computing has not yet gained any such attention, which although is a potential approach and may be able to solve this problem. Thus, it is highly desirable to examine the performance of existing soft computing techniques and based on the outcomes accordingly make improvements and/or design and develop new ones for the issue in question. With this motivation, in this study we examine the performance of single layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN) in ISMR forecast and for the first time apply random vector functional link network (RVFL) and regularized online sequential network − RVFL (ROS-RVFL) for the forecast purpose and subsequently examine their relative performance with respect to SLFN. Seasonal forecast of ISMR is made a year in advance using the previous year's data. Six sets of forecasts are made, by varying the length of the past data (training period), ranging from 5 to 10 years. It is found that ROS-RVFL is more accurate and computationally more efficient than SLFN and RVFL. Secondly, irrespective of the techniques, when we consider the last 8 years of past data for the training purpose the result is found to be relatively more accurate, and the ensemble mean of forecast with 8 and 9 years of training period gives the best result among all the trials. Based on statistical and detail analyses finally it is concluded that ROS-RVFL with ensemble mean of 8–9 years training period is a promising approach for ISMR forecast. © 2017","Artificial neural network; Indian summer monsoon rainfall; Monsoon prediction; Random vector functional link; Single layer feed-forward neural network","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Soft computing; Functional links; Functional-link network; Indian summer monsoon rainfall; Relative performance; Scientific community; Seasonal forecasts; Single layer feed-forward neural networks; Softcomputing techniques; Rain","Dash, Y.; Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, India; email: yajnasenidash@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",15684946,,,,"English","Appl.

The proposed scheme uses the Koopman mode technique on fault current data obtained from phasor measurement units for WABP and FLI. The main advantage of the proposed scheme is that it is based on spatiotemporal information system (STIS). As we know that in real-world applications, often time and space exist together, and hence, dealing with spatial aspect without considering temporal aspect is of limited use. Similarly, the introduction of series compensation in a power transmission network is common nowadays due to many technical benefits. The FLI in a power network with series-compensation is more complicated due to complex transients produced by series capacitor and the metal-oxide varistor. The proposed scheme is developed using STIS for WABP and FLI under stressed conditions including power swing and load encroachment. The New England 39 bus system is used as the test system, which is developed on Dig-Silent power factory commercial software (PF4C) platform for evaluating the performance of the proposed technique.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel three stage algorithm for visibility recovery in UW images by considering both sensor blur and noise. In the first stage, blind deconvolution is used for the estimation of an unknown point spread function (PSF). In the second stage, a new prior called weighted median channel prior (WMCP) is used for the estimation of scene depth and background light. In the third stage, a color balancing (CB) module is adopted to minimize the effect of non-uniform color cast.

However, the performance of the fuzzy system is dependent on the structure of membership function and rule base. Thus, an adaptive way of membership function tuning has been adopted in this paper. The tuning of the parameters has been performed using various heuristic approaches to observe the performance of tuned fuzzy system for DRX application compared to traditional non- fuzzy and un-tuned models. The simulation experiments carried out with different load types in different seasons demonstrate the improvement in DRX welfare for adaptively tuned fuzzy system to the traditional and un-tuned models. The adaptive tuning presented in this paper can be used by individual DR seller to calculate the participation bids. © 2018 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Demand Response (DR); Demand response exchange (DRX); Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO); Heuristic optimization; Pool Based Clearing","Artificial intelligence; Fuzzy systems; Heuristic methods; Lakes; Membership functions; Optimization; Power electronics; Sales; Tuning; Demand response; Demand response exchanges; Heuristic optimization; Optimizers; Pool-based; Fuzzy inference",,,"IEEE Computer Society",21603162,9781538649961,,,"English","India Int.

The proposed EV charging system is able to exchange active and reactive power demand by either side of the bidirectional charger. The primary EV battery operates in a bidirectional charging mode through a dual active bridge converter with a phase shifting operation whereas the auxiliary battery operates in a unidirectional mode to provide power to the EV auxiliary units. This improved topology of dual battery charging system operates independently to maintain necessary amount of battery voltage without affecting the transformer efficiency. The active and reactive power demand is met by the high capacity EV primary battery, whereas the auxiliary battery is intended only for unidirectional controlled power flow. In this paper the EV charging topology is investigated with a front end decoupled power control and a secondary battery sliding mode control (SMC) for bi-directional power flow operation. The mathematical model of the proposed converter is discussed through state space averaging technique to analyse the converter dynamics with variable demand during bi-directional power flow operation.

The proposed NAF is the improved form of classical adaptive vectorial filter (AVF), where inherent problems of AVF technique, like unable to handle the phase imbalance and phase shift issues, are successfully mitigated. For performance evaluation of NAF based control technique, a single-stage topology of three-phase grid integrated solar PV system is taken, where the loads are connected at the PCC (Point of Common Coupling). The prime objective of proposed NAF based control technique is to meet the active power requirement of loads from generated solar PV power, and after fulfill the load demand, the excess power is supplied to the grid. However, when generated PV power is not sufficient for the load then the NAF based control fulfills the load demand by taking extra required power from the grid. During this process, the power quality of the grid power is improved. The controller action provides, power factor correction, harmonics filtering and mitigation of other power quality issues. Moreover, when the solar irradiation is zero, then the voltage source converter acts as a distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM), which enhances the utilization factor of the system.

For a general AC-OPF model, decomposition of MS into its constituents is a challenge. Therefore, this paper proposes a solution for decomposing MS into its constituents, i.e., network losses, congestion, and reactive support services, by deriving analytical expressions for each of the components. An optimization problem, named pseudo-IV-OPF, is set up around the existing AC-OPF solution to derive expressions. The central idea involved in current and voltage OPF, that the current flow at sending end is exactly equal and opposite at receiving end, is exploited to derive the elements of MS by using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of optimality. It is important to note that a converged OPF solution, obtained from the standard AC-OPF model used by the utility, is an input to the proposed model.

Several research works highlight the benefits of aggregator-based scheduling, where all aggregators operate in similar conditions with the same amount of purchased energy. However, there are unscheduled EVs left due to unavailability of sufficient energy and/or charging slots. This paper presents a multiaggregator-based charge scheduling scheme that incorporates collaborative charging and realistic situations with variable energy purchase (VEP) and cancelation charges. VEP reflects a practical situation where the aggregator purchases energy based on average scheduling requests per day. Similarly, customers are penalized for not arriving at the scheduled slot. The charge scheduling problem is addressed from the aggregator point of view, wherein the total profit and the number of scheduled EVs are maximized. With VEP, a greater number of EVs were scheduled through collaboration and overall profits were observed to be higher than with equal energy purchased. The implementation of cancelation charges on the customer further resulted in an increase in the profits. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Cancelation events; collaborative electric vehicle (EV) charge scheduling; electric vehicle; multiaggregator","Electric vehicles; Job shop scheduling; Nickel; Optimization; Profitability; Sales; Cancellation Events; Charging station; Collaboration; Collaborative EV Charge Scheduling (CEVCS); Informatics; Multi-aggregator; Stakeholders; Scheduling","Gupta, V.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: vishu.gupta0607@gmail.com",,"IEEE Computer Society",15513203,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

In order to preserve the security of the system, it is desirable that if any fault occurs during power swing while the relay is blocked, the system operator should be able to deblock the relay. It is not an issue with unsymmetrical faults. However, owing to its symmetrical nature sometimes during power swing when a symmetrical fault occurs the relay remains blocked. With an aim to detect a symmetrical fault during power swing, this paper proposes a technique based on Hilbert transform that monitors three-phase active power on the transmission line. The technique was implemented and verified on WSCC 9 bus system built on DIg SILENT Power Factory. The results justify immunity of the technique towards the location of the fault and fault inception time.

The existing methods rely on settings being proposed by the operators, which in turn are calculated from exhaustive offline simulation studies. Apart from being cumbersome, these methods are not adaptable to the changes in the power system. As such, the requirement of an algorithm to identify power swings based on local measurements and without settings cannot be emphasized enough. This paper examines the effectiveness of one such method to detect power swings based on continuous impedance measurements, and identifies the cases where the same is found to be lacking. Necessary modifications are suggested to make the algorithm overcome the identified shortcomings. The benefit of this method is that it employs a very simplistic approach in analyzing the locus of the impedance trajectory to identify power swings and the suggested improvements do not require any additional functional blocks to improve its effectiveness. The effectiveness of the suggested approach is validated on Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) 9-bus system. The results show improved performance in terms of power swing identification over wide range of swing frequency. © 2018 IEEE.","Distance relay; Power Swing Detection; Setting free algorithm","Electric power systems; Distance relay; Functional block; Impedance measurement; Local measurement; Off-line simulations; Power swing blocking; Power swings; Power system blackout; Electric relays",,"Urooj S.Mukhopadhyay S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538611388,,,"English","IEEMA Eng.

The relation between load criticality and flexibility in terms of utilization and availability factors has been established and incorporated into the DR seller/customer bids in DRX through dynamic costing.

Most of the existing work on residential demand response programs focused on utility-consumer interaction in a coordinating game model via two-way communication to achieve minimization of total cost and peak to average ratio. The prior work has considered the problem of energy consumption scheduling for multiple users but fails to address the optimally fair environment for scheduling. This paper proposes a consumer preference based demand response model formulated in a game-theoretic framework. The proposed model have a key feature that no consumer can acquire profit by deviating from the prescribed strategies or chronological order. The optimal game scheduling for minimizing the energy costs is achieved by using correlated equilibrium represented as Nash Equilibrium of energy consumption scheduling game. The simulation results clearly demonstrate the minimization of peak to average ratio up to 31.4% on an average for each day. The cost benefit of 261.6$ in a day is reaped by total users in the system which is highest among all days. The proof of existence of Nash Equilibrium is authenticated in the appendix. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Automatic load control; Day ahead scheduling; Demand response programs; Game theory; Nash equilibrium","Computation theory; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Electric load management; Energy utilization; Housing; Scheduling; Automatic load controls; Correlated equilibria; Day-ahead scheduling; Demand response programs; Nash equilibria; Peak to average ratios; Residential consumers; Two way communications; Game theory","Pal, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: palshalini95@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",01420615,,IEPSD,,"English","Int J Electr Power Energy Syst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034589443

The proposed model of DR bids takes into account, the load attributes such as utilization and availability factors. The criticality and willingness of the DR load/customer are embedded into seller market bids through utilization and availability factor, respectively. Various cost models have been developed to emulate the possible customer behavior in DR cost modeling. However, modeling of indistinct and uncertain nature of customer behavior is a complex issue in real-time consideration. Therefore, this paper also presents a fuzzy inference system (FIS) for considering the customer load profile attributes in DR bids. In addition, parameter tuning of fuzzy membership functions is also carried out in this paper using heuristic optimization techniques to improve the performance of FIS in DRX clearing. The proposed methodology with load profile attributes is simulated considering various load types across different load sectors.

The smarter the power grid gets, the more vulnerable it becomes to cyber-attacks. Various detection methods of cyber-attacks have been proposed in the literature in recent past. However, to completely alleviate the possibility of cyber-threats, the compromised meters must be identified and secured. In this study, the authors are presenting an artificial intelligence (AI)-based identification method to correctly single out the malicious meters. The proposed AI-based method successfully identifies the compromised meters by anticipating the correct measurements in the event of the cyber-attack. New York Independent System Operator load data is mapped with the IEEE 14-bus system to validate the proposed method. The efficiency of the proposed method is compared for artificial neural network and extreme learning machine-based AI techniques.

Additionally, the binary coded variants of basic as well as MMFOA namely binary coded modified moth flame optimization algorithms (BMMFOA) are developed for solving unit commitment (UC) problem. The moth-flame algorithm is a nature inspired heuristic search approach that mimics the traverse navigational properties of moths around artificial lights tricked for natural moon light. Unlike many other swarm based approaches, the position update in MFOA is a one-to-one procedure between a moth and corresponding flame. In the basic MFOA, to improve exploitation characteristics of moths, the flame number is reduced as a function of iteration count. The last flame with worst fitness is then duplicated to serve as position update reference for left over (excess) moths. The four additional variants proposed in this paper includes different flame selection procedures based on balance between exploitation and exploration aspects of search process. The proposed BMMFOA variants are tested on unit commitment problem of power system operational scheduling. The binary mapping of continuous/real valued moth, flame locations for solving UC problem is carried out using modified sigmoidal transformation. The efficacy of the proposed BMMFOA against basic MFOA and other approaches for various test systems is analysed in terms of solution quality, execution time and convergence characteristics.

The grey wolf optimizer belongs to the class of bio-inspired heuristic optimization approaches and mimics the hierarchical and hunting principles of grey wolves. The binarization of GWO is owing to the UC problem characteristic binary/discrete search space. The binary string representation of BGWO is analogous to the commitment and de-committed status of thermal units constrained by minimum up/down times. Two models of Binary Grey Wolf Optimizer are presented to solve UC problem.

These techniques present a tough competition to traditional numerical methods which suffer from convexity and continuity assumptions and which normally employ a gradient based search that is sensitive to the initial solution. While initial BI techniques suffered from limitations such as premature convergence and dependence on control parameters, eventually, these issues were specifically addressed by improved variants and many novel BI methods. The population based computing methods are particularly attractive for solving multi-objective (MO) problems due to their capability of producing a large number of Pareto-optimal solutions in one run. In this paper, an integrated ranking index (IRI) composed of TOPSIS and fuzzy-min concept is proposed as a performance metrics to aggregate the different objectives. The performance of eight handpicked recent BI techniques is compared for the solution of wind integrated multi-objective optimal power dispatch (MOOD) problem for simultaneous minimization of fuel cost and emission.

The temporally coupled customer behavior can be better represented using the load profile attributes, when compared to the traditional approach with random willingness assignment. The proposed cost models for energy and reserve offerings consider the effect of load type, load pattern consumption, and availability/flexibility patterns of each type of load with time of use constraints. The load curtailment (LC) cost model accounts for criticality and willingness of the responsive loads via utilization factor and availability factors, respectively. The proposed cost models present a realistic picture of LC cost by eliminating the random willingness factor of the existing LC cost models. Thereafter, various cases of market participation with different reserve payment policies are formulated for combined participation of GENCO and DRACO. In addition, the sensitivity of participation decision of various entities to the seasonal load variation is examined for summer and winter loading profiles. The proposed cost models and scheduling framework is simulated using GENCO with ten thermal units and DRACO with various load types, profiles distributed across different load sectors comprising of commercial, residential, industrial, municipal, and agricultural loads. The combined participation resulted in improved market surplus with reduced GENCO surplus. Also, the energy and reserve market surplus dependence on seasonal load patterns is observed across different test cases and payment policies. © 2017 IEEE.","Demand response aggregation company (draco); Generation company (genco); Load curtailment (lc); Load profiling; Price-based market scheduling; Responsive loads","Costs; Graphical user interfaces; Scheduling; Demand response; Generation companies; Load curtailment; Load profiling; Price-based; Responsive load; Commerce","Konda, S.R.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: srikanthkonda.eee@gmail.com",,"IEEE Computer Society",15513203,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Pre-fault operating conditions and synchronised phasor measurements at all generator buses are used to accomplish this task. Initially, the proposed scheme divides the whole power system under study into different protection zones corresponding to generator bus (es). Furthermore, a new index termed as 'gain in momentum' (GIM) at each generator bus is used to identify the expected tripped region (ETR). This information helps in reducing the search space. Once the ETR is identified, online measured power flow of line connected to generator of ETR having maximum GIM is compared with the estimated post-outage power flow of the same line. The post-outage power flow is obtained using pre-outage line flow and line outage distribution factor. The aforementioned power flow comparison helps in identifying the tripped transmission line. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated on the IEEE-39 bus New England system and 246-bus North India Grid using the Power System Simulation for Engineering software. The test results indicate that the proposed scheme is highly effective in identifying the tripped line of a transmission system. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Computer software; Electric equipment protection; Electric lines; Electric load flow; Electric power system protection; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Power transmission; Engineering software; Line outage distribution factors; On-line detection; Operating condition; Power system simulations; Power transmission systems; Synchronised phasor measurements; Transmission systems; Outages","Jena, M.K.; Electrical Engineering Department, India; email: kumarmanas87@yahoo.com",,"Institution of Engineering and Technology",17518687,,,,"English","IET Gener.

False data injection attack (FDIA) is one such severe threat, if wisely constructed, can cause flawed estimation of power system states, thereby, leading to uneconomical and unsecured operation of power system.

In this paper, a new Gravitational Search (GS) based algorithm is presented for achieving optimal coordination of directional overcurrent relays. The proposed algorithm utilizes user defined characteristic for inverse time overcurrent relays than the predefined standard curves. The user defined relay characteristic deals with constants that control the shape of the characteristics as variable adjustable values which are optimally chosen along with TDS and Plug Setting Multiplier (PSM).

The navigation mechanism is modelled as a spirally converging approach of moth towards flame.

Moreover, it is based on a single sensor, which is applicable for the PV array-fed battery charging. The working principle of Self-Estimated HC (SEHC) algorithm is based on three consecutive operating points on the power-current characteristic. By using perpendicular line analogy (PLA), these points decide direction, and an optimised operating position for next iteration, which is responsible for quick maximum power point tracking as well as improved dynamic performance. Moreover, in every new iteration, the step size is reduced by 90% from the previous step size, which provides an oscillation-free steady-state performance. Owing to a single sensor, the computational burden, as well as calculation complexity of the SEHC algorithm is less, so it can be simply implemented on a cheaper microcontroller. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated by MATLAB simulation as well as tested on the experimental prototype.

To investigate the same, a multi-objective function, including both economic as well as environmental interests is formulated. Pertaining to the inclusion of renewable energy technologies (RETs), constraints and penetration bounds are introduced. In addition, to examine the tradeoff criteria in preservation of environmental and economic interests, pareto sets are obtained and also, a simple optimality condition for selection of near optimal solution from the obtained pareto set is proposed. Further, various scheduling alternatives/scenarios and cases are proposed to analyze the scheduling scenarios against operation strategies of different markets. Simulation results are presented and discussed in detail. Observations of the pareto sets revealed that, RET schedules in pareto dominant solutions are affected by scheduling scenario. The intervention of RET affected the optimal tradeoff between economic and environmental interests. Therefore, optimal scheduling pertaining to particular scenario affects the energy schedule of both conventional, RET and thereby affecting resultant profit and emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Independent system operator (ISO); Pareto optimality; Profit based resource scheduling; Renewable energy technologies (RETs); Solar photovoltaic (SPV); Wind energy generator (WEG)","Deregulation; Pareto principle; Power markets; Scheduling; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Wind power; Independent system operator; Independent system operators; Pareto-optimality; Profit based resource scheduling; Renewable energy technologies; Renewable energy technology; Resource-scheduling; Solar photovoltaic; Solar photovoltaics; Wind energy generator; Wind energy generators; Profitability; electricity generation; electricity industry; energy market; photovoltaic system; profitability; renewable resource; solar power; sustainability; wind power","Srikanth Reddy, K.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: srikanthreddy@ee.iitd.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

With recent incorporation of information technology and advanced metering infrastructure, the futuristic grid is more prone to cyber-threats. The false data injection (FDI) attack is one of the most thoroughly researched cyber-attacks. Intelligently crafted, it can cause false estimation of states, which further seriously affects the entire power system operation. In this paper, we propose joint-transformation-based scheme to detect FDI attacks in real time. The proposed method is built on the dynamics of measurement variations. Kullback-Leibler distance is used to find out the difference between probability distributions obtained from measurement variations. The proposed method is tested using IEEE 14 bus system considering attack on different state variables.

The first level comprises of DRP scheduling with the objective of minimizing the electricity bill payments. The second stage includes a rescheduling strategy aided by DSO scheduling preferences constrained by the economic preferences of consumers set up in the first level of the scheduling strategy. There are two strategies for the second level: namely, static residential demand response (S-RDR), and dynamic residential demand response (D-RDR), which differ by the time sequence of operation and interactions between DRPA and DRPs. In S-RDR, the interactions between the two are limited to single event-acknowledge policy wherein all the DRPs act to schedule their responsive loads in a day ahead fashion. However, in D-RDR, multiple/continuous iterations take place between DRPA and DRPs with the consideration of optimal performance with respect to real-time market prices.

Thus differentiating fault from stressed conditions and making the protection scheme intelligent enough to stop the relay maloperations has become very important. There are a few computational intelligent techniques proposed in the literature for preventing relay maloperations. However with the increase in size and complexity of the power systems there have been situations during which there is change in network topology or system parameters. An online intelligent technique: online sequential extreme learning machine (OSELM) has been suggested in this paper which under such real time situations successfully furnishes accurate results. This online computational intelligence technique based on synchronized wide area measurements has been implemented to develop a classifier that differentiates fault from power swing and voltage instability. Potential of this online tool in preventing relay maloperations has been validated by comparing it with other offline intelligent techniques during real time scenario. © 2017 IEEE.","Distance Relay Maloperation; OSELM; Power Swing; Voltage instability","Electric power systems; Electric relays; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Wide area networks; Computational intelligence techniques; Computational intelligent techniques; Distance relay; Intelligent techniques; Online sequential extreme learning machine; OSELM; Power swings; Voltage instability; Electric power system protection",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509040001,,,"English","Int.

This paper presents methods for intelligent control of traffic lights for traffic management and resolving road congestion incidents. The increasing volume of traffic, along with ineffective management of road capacity, has contributed towards increasing number of congestion events on road networks. The congestion events may be managed through control of the sequence in which traffic lights turn green, along with modifying the time for which the lights are green for each phase. In this paper, optimal traffic light sequence is obtained for a single intersection (node) using the Hopfield Neural Network (HNN). The optimal green time (gi) for the traffic lights is obtained using Genetic Algorithm (GA) for a 4 phase road network. It was observed that the HNN provides the optimal sequence of green lights in an average of 16 iterations. GA provides a value of gi that would maximise the traffic flow. Results of optimal gi are presented for various cycle times. It is found that the flow rate increases with the increase in green times (gi). © 2017 IEEE.","Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) Genetic Algorithm (GA); Smart City; Traffic management","Genetic algorithms; Highway administration; Highway planning; Hopfield neural networks; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Smart city; Traffic control; Transportation; Urban growth; Congestion events; Congestion management; Hopfield neural networks (HNN); Intelligent traffics; Optimal green time; Resource management; Single intersections; Traffic management; Traffic congestion",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509062553,,,"English","TENSYMP - IEEE Int.

Therefore, if these atmospheric parameters fluctuate rapidly, then the maximum power point (MPP) of the P-V curve of PV array also fluctuates very rapidly. This rapid fluctuation of the MPP may be in accordance with the uniform shading of the PV panel or may be in accordance to the partially shaded due to the clouds, tall building, trees, and raindrops. However, in both cases, the MPP tracking (MPPT) is not only a nonlinear problem, this becomes a highly nonlinear problem, which solution is time bounded. Because the highly fluctuating atmospheric conditions change the P-V characteristic after every small time duration. This paper introduces a hybrid of 'Jaya' and 'differential evolution (DE)' (JayaDE) technique for MPPT in the highly fluctuating atmospheric conditions. This JayaDE algorithm is tested on MATLAB simulator and is verified on a developed hardware of the solar PV system, which consists of a single peak and many multiple peaks in the voltage-power curve. Moreover, the tracking ability is compared with the recent state of the art methods. The satisfactory steady-state and dynamic performances of this new hybrid technique under variable irradiance and temperature levels show the superiority over the state-of-the-art control methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Differential evolution (DE); fluctuating atmospheric conditions; Jaya optimization; maximum power point tracking (MPPT); partial shading; solar photovoltaic (PV)","Evolutionary algorithms; Maximum power point trackers; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Tall buildings; Atmospheric conditions; Differential Evolution; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Partial shading; Solar photovoltaics; Optimization","Kumar, N.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: nishant.kumar1729@gmail.com",,"IEEE Computer Society",15513203,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

However, owing to the non-linearity of the system, the process becomes iterative and cumbersome. In order to address this issue, a new technique for fault location on transmission lines using only voltage measurements obtained from Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) and the network bus admittance matrix has been reported in this paper. It is based on the fundamental law of electrical networks. It delineates a single step method to find out the faulted line and the exact location of fault. The decision is based on change in injected current at various buses following the line fault. The method has been tested on IEEE 14 bus and New England 39 bus system. Applicability of the proposed algorithm is independent of fault type, location of fault and fault resistance. This method not only proves to be accurate but also furnishes quick results with reduced computational burden.

With the integration of information technology and advanced metering infrastructure, the power grid has become smart. The smart meters have allowed the system operators to continuously monitor the power system in real time and take necessary action to avoid system failures. Malicious actor, with access to the smart meters can modify sensor measurements to disrupt the operation of power system. To make the power system resilient to such cyber-attacks, it is important to study all possible outcomes of cyber-intrusions. In this paper, we present an attack on security constrained optimum power flow. We show with the help of case studies how an attacker, by injecting false data in load measurement sensors, can force system operator to change the dispatch and hence make the power system N-1 in-compliant. The attack is modeled as a bi-level optimization problem, aiming to find the minimum set of sensors required to launch the attack. From the system operator's perspective, critical lines and critical generators vulnerable to false data injection (FDI) attack are identified.

The commonly used empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has limitations such as sensitivity to noise and sampling rate. However, VMD is an entirely non-recursive algorithm, where the modes are extracted concurrently. These modes help in extracting dynamic patterns of different power system disturbances. The performance of the proposed scheme is extensively validated on the IEEE-39 bus New England test system. The modes generated and the frequency deviation contours of the disturbances including generation loss, fault and line outage are assessed using VMD and the results provide improved performance in terms of decomposition quality compared with the existing EMD technique. Furthermore, a data-mining model known as decision tree is used to classify different power system disturbances based on intrinsic mode functions generated through VMD. The suggested method shows improved decomposition quality and classification accuracy.

The EHN is an energy constrained node and is thereby, assumed to have a power splitter at its receiver to decode information and harvest energy simultaneously from the received RF signal. The EHN behaves maliciously and decodes ST's messages when it is granted with a permission to (only) harvest energy from the received RF signal, thereby reducing the secrecy capacity of the ST-SR link. Since both ST and EHN are selfish with conflicting interests, we model the interaction between them as a Stackelberg game (SG). Further, we analyze the behavior of the nodes in a non-cooperative game (NCG) theoretic framework and prove the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy. Simulation results show that the SG framework performs better than the NCG framework, in terms of the achievable secrecy capacity of the ST-SR link. Thereby the proposed SG model is applied to the considered CRN with multiple STs and a unique equilibrium is found. In case the STs possess limited channel state information (CSI), we model the competition among the STs as a Bayesian game and found its equilibrium solution, known as Bayesian NE (BNE).

The PMUs provide the positive-sequence phasor information of the voltage and current signals at each and every bus of a system to a phasor data concentrator (PDC).

Here, for quick and efficient tracking, a novel hybrid 'Cauchy and Gaussian sine cosine optimization' (CGSCO) algorithm is proposed for MPPT, which is based on only a single current sensor. The main objective of the CGSCO algorithm is, maximum extraction of the power from SPV panel and efficiently charging the battery through maximizing the charging current of the battery. Due to the single sensor, the cost of the charging scheme is very low, as well as the algorithm complexity and computational burden are very less, so it can be easily implemented on the low-cost microcontroller. In this paper, a single current sensor-based battery charging scheme by CGSCO algorithm is tested on MATLAB simulator and verified on a developed hardware of the SPV system. The panel condition, with and without shaded as well as dynamic environmental condition (variable temperature and insolation), is considered during simulation as well as on hardware implementation. Moreover, the tracking ability is compared with the most recent state of the art techniques (Grey wolf optimization and Lagrange interpolation particle swarm optimization (LIPSO)) as well as compared with 'CGSCO with the conventional dual (voltage and current) sensor-based MPPT scheme.'

Furthermore, constraints pertaining to penetration and curtailments of RETs are restructured. Additionally, an appropriate objective function for profit incurred by conventional resource IPPs through reserve market participation as a function of renewable energy curtailment is also proposed.

The availability of the milling system is influenced by poor controls and faults occurring inside the mills. There is a need for automated systems, which can provide early information about the condition of the mill and help operators to take informed decisions. In this paper, a model-based residual evaluation approach, which is capable of online fault detection and diagnosis of major faults occurring in the milling system, is proposed. A dynamic mathematical model of mill, which can authentically replicate the mill behavior under different conditions, is selected for residual generation. Fuzzy logic is employed for residual evaluation to determine the type and magnitude of the fault, while Bayesian network is used for troubleshooting the root cause. The proposed technique is validated using historical data of coal mills obtained from an actual coal-fired power plant in India. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The results indicate that the proposed approach has potential to provide useful information regarding the condition of the mills and can help operators to take appropriate control action timely.

Moreover, the tracking ability is compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The satisfactory steady-state and dynamic performances of the new hybrid technique under variable irradiance and temperature levels show the superiority over the state-of-the-art control methods. © 2017 IEEE.","Differential evolution; MPPT; partial shading; solar PV; whale optimization","Evolutionary algorithms; MATLAB; Maximum power point trackers; Photovoltaic effects; Solar power generation; Differential Evolution; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Partial shading; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar PVs; State-of-the-art methods; Steady state oscillation; Steady-state and dynamic performance; Optimization",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",19493029,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

In this paper, we present a new methodology for EEG-based automated diagnosis of epilepsy. Our method involves detection of key points at multiple scales in EEG signals using a pyramid of difference of Gaussian filtered signals. Local binary patterns (LBPs) are computed at these key points and the histogram of these patterns are considered as the feature set, which is fed to the support vector machine (SVM) for the classification of EEG signals. The proposed methodology has been investigated for the four well-known classification problems namely, 1) normal and epileptic seizure, 2) epileptic seizure and seizure free, 3) normal, epileptic seizure, and seizure free, and 4) epileptic seizure and nonseizure EEG signals using publically available university of Bonn EEG database. Our experimental results in terms of classification accuracies have been compared with existing methods for the classification of the aforementioned problems. Further, performance evaluation on another EEG dataset shows that our approach is effective for classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. The proposed methodology based on the LBP computed at key points is simple and easy to implement for real-time epileptic seizure detection. © 2013 IEEE.","Computer-assisted diagnosis; epilepsy; local binary pattern (LBP); support vector machine (SVM) classifier","Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Electroencephalography; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurophysiology; Support vector machines; Automated diagnosis; Classification accuracy; Computer assisted diagnosis; Electroencephalogram signals; epilepsy; Epileptic seizure detection; Epileptic seizures; Local binary patterns; Biomedical signal processing; accuracy; Article; computer assisted diagnosis; electrocardiography; electroencephalography; electromyography; epilepsy; epileptic focus; histogram; mathematical phenomena; mental performance; predictive value; seizure; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; computer assisted diagnosis; electroencephalography; epilepsy; factual database; human; procedures; signal processing; Databases, Factual; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Humans; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Support Vector Machine",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21682194,,ITIBF,"27416609","English","IEEE J.

The principal advantage of Koopman operator is that it is based on spatiotemporal information system (STIS).

The wide area back-up protection scheme is developed using STIS for fault identification and classification including wide variations in operating conditions of the power network.

Being able to track the location of a Wi-Fi or Radio Frequency Identification device could improve the quality of services in various sectors, including security, warehouse, logistic management, and healthcare. As compared with outdoor environment, positioning systems face a greater challenge in indoor environment because wireless signal is significantly influenced by building layout and surrounding objects, for which a location fingerprinting approach is needed. Moreover, the signal strength of a wireless device may also change over time, which is known as temporal variation, and therefore a reliable location estimation system must have the ability to learn and adapt with temporal changes. However, if the learning process is highly complex and requires long processing time, deploying the system into a larger scale would not be feasible. In recent years, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has surfaced as a viable alternative that challenged the norm of iterative and progressive learning. ELM has also been considered as a solution for indoor location fingerprinting. However, there has not been a comprehensive review on how the ELM-based approaches are linked with existing location fingerprinting techniques. Here we discuss some major location fingerprinting techniques, which are nearest-neighbor, LANDMARC, and LEMT, and formulate a new framework for systematically translating the techniques into ELM-based methods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","ELM; Location fingerprinting; Signal strength; Temporal variation","Building signal systems; Iterative methods; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Location; Radio; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Extreme learning machine; Location estimation; Location finger printings; Logistic management; Progressive learning; Radio frequency identification devices; Signal strengths; Temporal variation; Mobile computing","Dwiyasa, F.; School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Singapore; email: felis001@e.ntu.edu.sg",,"Springer New York LLC",09236082,,MUSPE,,"English","Multidimens Syst Signal Proc",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963636167

AsMDs are scattered over a large geographical area, they need help of relaying nodes or data concentrators (DCs) to forward their data to the PO. However, the DC nodes are third party devices and are not reliable. In this work, we consider the DC to be an energy harvesting node and is assumed to have a power splitter at its receiver to decode information and harvest energy simultaneously from the MD transmission using simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technique. However, the DC tends to eavesdrop on the received data, thus reducing the secrecy capacity of MD-PO links. Since both MDs and the DC are selfish with conflicting interests, we model the interaction between them as a non-cooperative Stackelberg game. The objective of the MDs is to maximize the secrecy capacity of their links to the PO, whereas the DC aims at maximizing the information it can decode from the received MDs' signal. The existence of a unique equilibrium point is proved through mathematical analysis. Further, a distributed algorithm is proposed, following which the players will attain the equilibrium of the game as predicted by analytical results. Simulation results validate the analytical results and demonstrate that the proposed framework improves the secrecy capacity of the considered network significantly. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Decoding; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Energy harvesting; Energy transfer; Forward scattering; Analytical results; Data concentrators; Equilibrium point; Geographical area; Information and power transfers; Mathematical analysis; Measurement device; Stackelberg Games; Smart power grids",,"Papadias C.B.Jamalipour A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509015252,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The PLC is an emerging field of communication for the home area network of smart grid. Because power lines were not initially designed for communication purposes, they offer a difficult communication environment in the form of impulsive noise and multiplicative noise, in addition to the background noise. This elucidates the need for evaluating the performance of PLC systems by taking into account all these factors. The performance of a PLC system under the influence of Rayleigh distributed channel gain, background noise (with nonuniform phase), and impulsive noise is comprehensively studied in this paper. We evaluate closed-form expressions of the average bit error rate and outage probability for different cases depending on the presence or absence of impulsive noise and channel gain. We provide a further insight into the system by obtaining the diversity of the PLC system. Simulation results closely match with our analysis, thereby establishing the validity of the derived expressions.

This 'WPSCO' technique is used for quick and oscillation-free tracking of the global best peak position in a very less number of steps, which is necessary to work in real-time atmospheric conditions. The unique advantage of this algorithm for MPPT problem in PS condition is as it is free from common and generalised problem of the other evolutionary techniques such as longer convergence duration, a large number of search particles, steady-state oscillation, unnecessary computational burden etc., which create power loss and oscillations in output. This hybrid algorithm is tested on different types of PV characteristics of the PS solar PV array by using MATLAB simulator and verified on a developed hardware of the solar PV system. Moreover, the tracking ability is compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The satisfactory steadystate and dynamic performances of the WPSCO algorithm under variable irradiance and temperature levels show the superiority over the state-of-the-art control methods. © 2016 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Condition monitoring; Maximum power point trackers; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Wind turbines; Atmospheric conditions; Evolutionary techniques; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Solar photovoltaic system; State-of-the-art methods; Steady state oscillation; Steady-state and dynamic performance; Steady-state condition; Solar power generation","Kumar, N.; Electrical Department, India; email: nishant.kumar1729@gmail.com",,"Institution of Engineering and Technology",17521416,,,,"English","IET.

The mutually exclusive scheduling objectives of demand response provider (DRP) and distribution network operator (DNO) are optimally compromised by DRA through incentive-based participation strategies of DRPs. Thus, the proposed methodology is a two-stage optimisation process in which the prioritised schedules (to minimise total electricity charges/cost) of DRP obtained through first-stage optimisation are rescheduled by DRA in the second-stage optimisation considering the system/DNO benefits. The proposed methodology considers the behaviour (risk averse nature, incentive favourable nature etc.) through DRPs registration in various participation strategies. The effectiveness of proposed methodology on techno-economic aspects/attributes is examined using IEEE 34 bus distribution system for different operating conditions. The sensitivity analysis include the effect of load schedules due to change in strategy election by DRPs, change in performance attributes with respect to the penetration levels of responsive loads. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of DRA-coordinated load scheduling over base case with no responsive loads as well as prioritised schedules of responsive loads by DRPs. The optimal compromise between the objectives of DRPs and DNO is observed in terms of system wide benefits and electricity charges/cost of DRPs.

The scheduling problem is formulated as cost minimisation/benefit maximisation of distribution resources. The scheduling operation of distributed resources is evaluated for various perspectives such as customer driven, micro grid operator (MGO) driven and MGO driven with utility constraints. The MGO driven scheduling operation considers the distribution network loss minimisation in addition to economic benefits of distributed resources. The loss estimation of distributed network/microgrid is performed using forward-backward sweep algorithm, considering the ill-natured radial network. Thereafter, the optimisation is performed using modified gradient-based search method, considering the linear nature of the problem. The simulation results are presented and discussed for the three scheduling scenarios proposed under operation window constraints. The customer drivenscheduling of distributed resources resulted in highest profit among all the scheduling alternatives. On the other hand, the MGO driven scheduling horizon resulted in lower line loss cost component at a compromise of distribution resource benefit. The utility constrained MGO driven scheduling objective attained a compromise solution in terms of loss component and customer benefit. Thus, it is identified as best practice for overall welfare maximisation of microgrid/distribution network. © 2016 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Energy management; Sales; Customer benefits; Distributed networks; Distributed resources; Forward/ backward sweep; Gradient-based search; Scheduling operations; Scheduling problem; Strategic energy management; Scheduling","Konda, S.R.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: srikanthreddy@ee.iitd.ac.in",,"Institution of Engineering and Technology",17518687,,,,"English","IET Gener.

The wind power is generated using the permanent magnet brushless DC generator (PMBLDCG) and the MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) is executed with P&O (Perturb & Observe) approach to extract the maximum power from the wind generation. This power is fed to the AC load using a voltage source inverter (VSI) through the battery bank (BSS) at DC link. The control algorithm operates in standalone mode and grid connected mode. It can switch in islanded and grid connected modes seamlessly according to the wind conditions. In standalone mode, this wind power is fed to the load through a VSI, during low wind conditions, the battery discharges itself to fulfill the load demand. After that, the grid is connected to give power to the load during low wind conditions, and for this, control algorithm operates in grid connected mode. Therefore, the control algorithm switches from voltage control to current control mode to provide smooth synchronization and vise versa at de-synchronization.

Although noteworthy developments have been made in WT algorithms, most of the seizure detection works have been confined to using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). In this present effort, comparisons are made between DWT, wavelet packet transform and dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) for detection of epileptiform patterns in electroencephalography. For the study, combinations of energy, root-mean-square values and standard deviations are used as extracted feature inputs to the general regression neural network classifier. The paper describes unique methodology of using minimal training during K-folds cross-validation to highlight the robustness of the expert model. Classification rates, statistical parameters and computation timings are finally calculated and one-way analysis of variance is applied to validate the results. The results demonstrate statistically significant and ceiling level of classification performances (>98%) using DT-CWT extracted coefficients.

Consequently, there is a need to appropriately incorporate this risk in the wind energy scheduling paradigm. In the present work, the intermittency associated risk has been modelled as part of a cost optimization problem for the ISO in real time. A model to minimize the risk has also been proposed using various cost models that use dynamic risk aversion costs and reflect the market and system operating conditions. The two dynamic penalty cost/risk models included are, rescheduling cost and contractual compensation cost for wind energy deviation. The results obtained are compared with those from the deterministic model. The proposed approach is simulated on the IEEE 30 bus system and the findings from the proposed approach for wind energy scheduling lead to a low operational cost to the ISO in the real time market considered in the study. Among other observations, the consideration of uncertainty in Day-Ahead market leads to increase in cost savings of ISO with increase in wind uncertainty, but a corresponding reduction in the scheduled wind energy in the same market.","Day ahead market; Independent system operator; Market clearing price; Real time market; Spot market price; Wind energy","Cost accounting; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; Power markets; Scheduling; Smart power grids; Cost-allocation; Day ahead market; Independent system operators; Market Clearing Price; Market price; Penalty cost; Real- time; Real-time market; Spot market; Spot market price; Wind power","Srikanth Reddy, K.; Electrical Engineering, India; email: srikanthkonda.eee@gmail.com",,"International Journal of Renewable Energy Research",13090127,,,,"English","Int.

The conventional fossil fuel power plants pollutes environment by emitting some toxic gases. Hence, conventional minimum cost operation cannot be the only basis for generation dispatch, however emission minimisation can also be considered. The objective of reactive power optimisation problem can be seen as the minimisation of real power loss over the transmission lines. Large integrated power systems are being operated under heavily stressed conditions, which imposes the threat to voltage stability. The objectives economic dispatch, emission dispatch, loss minimisation and voltage stability are to be met for efficient operation and control. The simulation results of all 4 objectives, considering one objective at a time are conflicting and non-commensurable. Therefore, an efficient control scheme which meets all the specified objectives is required. Initially each objective is optimised independently using particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and then all the four objectives are optimised simultaneously using fuzzified PSO. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on IEEE 30 and IEEE 57 bus test systems.

The suggested QPBDSONN architecture mimics the classical parallel bidirectional self-organizing neural network architecture by embedding quantum computation which invokes the fundamental concepts and principles of quantum mechanics. The QPBDSONN architecture comprises three quantum bidirectional self-organizing neural networks (QBDSONNs) in the input layer to process three distinct color components (red, green, blue) separately used in the color noisy images. The principle of the operation of this QPBDSONN architecture is posed as a cluster of three parallel QBDSONNs after isolation of these three distinct basic color components from the pure noisy color images in the initial phase. Afterward, the basic color components obtained from the input noisy color images are fed simultaneously thorough three parallel different basic color component QBDSONNs for subsequent processing. Each of the three constituent QBDSONNs in the proposed network architecture comprises input, hidden or intermediate, and output layers of neurons. Each neuron of these three layers is intraconnected by means of an eight-connected neighborhood topology designated as qubits. The current parallel network architecture does not rely on a quantum back-propagation algorithm to adjust interconnection weights (described by rotation gates). Instead it uses qubit layers of neurons between the hidden layer and the output layer in a counterpropagation sense. Finally, quantum measurement is done with the aim of diminishing superposition of qubits in the output layer followed by a fusion operation to merge processed color image components in the sink layer and produce the true color output image.The superiority of the proposed QPBDSONN architecture is established by its application on synthetic and real-life wrench pure color images with different degrees of uniform noise and Gaussian noise by comparison with the classical parallel bidirectional self-organizing neural network, a supervised autoassociative Hopfield network, and a nonlinear technique named the median filter with adaptive Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT). The QPBDSONN architecture outperforms its classical counterpart and the threefold parallel Hopfield network as far as timing efficiency is concerned and it also restores the shapes of extracted images with greater accuracy than with the median filter with adaptive discrete wavelet transformations. Finally, the statistical significance of the proposed QPBDSONN architecture is determined by a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In the problem formulation, transformer tap settings and reactive power compensating devices settings are also considered as control variables. OPF is a complicated optimisation problem, hence there is a need to solve this problem with an accurate algorithm. In the proposed CATLBO algorithm, the class is divided into different sections, and allot different teacher to every section depending on the performance of that particular section. This sectioning of the class makes the proposed technique more robust and less prone to trapping in local optima. The OPF solution is obtained by considering generator fuel cost, transmission loss and voltage stability index as objective functions.

The diagnostic accuracy can be limited by incompetence of the operating personnel, which can be supplemented by machine learning algorithms for classification of physiology and pathology. This paper uses effective information feature extraction, principal component analysis (PCA) for feature reduction and support vector machine (SVM) for classification of multi-sequence MR images of 7 patients. All axial slices of the brain are classified into normal and abnormal images. Various methods for feature extraction were tested among which effective information yielded the highest accuracy of 80.8 in a set of 677 images used for training and testing. The sensitivity and specificity were 80 and 81.06, respectively. Different grid sizes were tested, and the highest accuracy was reported for 2 × 2 which indicates that the feature extraction must be taken over a small grid to ensure detection of minor variation from normal. The image sequences tested considered in the study are T1 weighted, T2 weighted, Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and post contrast T1 weighted. T2 weighted images were best classified with the maximum accuracy of 95.97. This method proved to be effective to classify the images of all four sequences with accuracy ranging from 92-96. The method was also tested with out of sample data and the accuracy obtained was 72.4. The novelty of this work lies in the classification of multi-sequential images using all the different slices of the patient which includes the top of the skull as well as the mandible. The slices differ significantly as the spread of the tumor varies with each slice. The slices are taken at 5mm gap and the tumor can have a thickness less or more than the slice gap considered for the scan. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

In carbon markets, the overall generation from conventional/fossil-fueled thermal plants is constrained over the total cost which is the sum of generation, capture cost/emission avoidance cost. Therefore, in this paper, generalized/uniform performance indices affecting the UC schedule are derived. Also, a commitment/scheduling methodology based on capture and fuel cost is devised rather than the existing penalty cost methodology as in the modernized markets everything was dealt in monetary value. Furthermore, the impact of type of resource used, i.e., coal rank is also considered to evaluate the sensitivity of scheduling decisions and financial influence of carbon capture technology. Along with performance indices, correction factors are also proposed to justify the effect of resource/coal rank in the process of optimal generation allocation. The effect of correction factors and type of coal is observed to be predominant at lower capture efficiencies compared to higher capture efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed method over the penalty method is reflected in reduced generation cost and emission avoidance cost when compared to the penalty-based methodology. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","Binary fireworks algorithm (BFWA); capture efficiency; carbon capture and storage (CCS); performance index (PI); resource scheduling; unit commitment (UC)","Coal deposits; Commerce; Constrained optimization; Costs; Efficiency; Optimal systems; Scheduling; Capture efficiency; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Fireworks algorithms; Performance indices; Resource-scheduling; Unit Commitment; Carbon capture",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",08858950,,ITPSE,,"English","IEEE Trans Power Syst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008689561

However, due to the shared nature of these networks, they are susceptible to jamming attacks which results in delay in transmitting these packets. In this work, we consider a wireless network consisting of an intelligent electronic device (IED) that transmits delay sensitive messages in a power substation in the presence of a jammer, which can jam multiple channels simultaneously. The objective of the IED is to successfully transmit its messages within a specified time, whereas the jammer wants to obstruct IED's transmission.

The analysis involving Log-Normal fading is very complicated; hence, we use the gamma approximation to Log- Normal distribution for our analysis. The additive noise in PLC channel follows Bernoulli-Gaussian distribution. We derive probability density function of end-To-end signal-To-noise ratio of the considered system.

Five objectives, cost, various emissions and power loss, are simultaneously optimized. The optimal schedules of thermal, hydro and wind power (WP) units are determined for continuously varying load subject to a large number of practical operational constraints. The effect of reserve and penalty coefficients and WP uncertainty is also investigated for the multi-objective (MO) problem. The newly proposed ALO algorithm has unique features like random walk, roulette wheel, and boundary shrinking. These operations provide a judicious balance between exploration and exploitation, and create a powerful optimization technique for complex real-world problems. Finding the best compromise solution (BCS) is a tedious task when multiple objectives are involved. A composite ranking index (CRI) is proposed as a performance metrics for MO problems. The CRI helps the decision maker in ranking the large number of Pareto-optimal solutions. The developed model is tested on three standard systems, having a mix of hydro, thermal and wind generators. The performance is found to be superior to published results and comparable with established algorithms like artificial bee colony (ABC) and differential evolution (DE). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive boundary shrinking; Ant lion optimization (ALO); Composite ranking index (CRI); Multi-objective hydro-thermal-wind scheduling (MOHTWS); Random walk mechanism; Wind reserve and penalty coefficients","Decision making; Evolutionary algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Random processes; Scheduling; Shrinkage; Wind power; Ant lion optimization (ALO); Composite ranking; Penalty coefficient; Random Walk; Thermal winds; Optimization; activity coefficient; adaptive management; algorithm; boundary condition; hydroelectric power plant; hydrothermal activity; index method; optimization; ranking; uncertainty analysis; wind power; Apoidea; Myrmeleontidae","Pandit, M.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: manjaree_p@hotmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

The ALO algorithm mimics the unique, 6-step hunting activity of ant lions in nature which is modelled by (i) constructing ant lion traps using roulette wheel, (ii) creating random walk of ants, (iii) entrapment of ants in pits, (iv) adaptive shrinking of traps for sliding ant towards ant lion, (v) catching ants and rebuilding the pits, and (vi) applying elitism. The random walk mechanism and roulette wheel operation for building traps provide the ALO with a high exploration capability. The shrinking of trap boundaries and elitism operations increase exploitation efficiency of the ALO, making it a very powerful search technique for complex domains. The wind integrated HTPGS is a non linear, non convex and highly complex optimization problem due to composite operational constraints associated with hydro, thermal and wind units. To demonstrate the applicability of the ALO algorithm for real-world problems, it is tested on four standard test systems. The obtained simulation results are compared with results of other algorithms reported in most recent literature.

The proposed QPBDSONN replicates the Parallel Bi-directional Self-Organizing Neural Network (PBDSONN) architecture and exploits by the power of quantum computation. To process three distinct basic color components (Red, Green and Blue) of noisy color image, QPBDSONN uses trinity of Quantum Bi-directional Self-organizing Neural Network (QBDSONN) architecture at the source layer in parallel mode. Each constituent QBDSONN comprises input, intermediate or hidden and output layers interconnected by 8-connected neighborhood topology based layer of neurons represented by qubits. Each constituent QBDSONN updates weighted interconnections in the form of quantum states through counter-propagation between hidden and output layer to obviate quantum back propagation. Rotation gates are introduced to represent weighted inter-links and values of activation. Finally, a quantum measurement operation is performed at the output layer of each constituent QBDSONN followed by fusion operation at the sink layer of QPBDSONN to concatenate the processed color image components resulting in the true output.

Automated seizure detection system can help health professionals in correctly diagnosing epilepsy. Design of automated seizure detection algorithms often requires using multiple features which increases the computational time of the system. In this work, we have proposed a method to detect ictal patterns in EEG by selecting optimum number of features without compromising the overall accuracy of the system. In this paper, EEG signals were decomposed using wavelet packet transform and energy features were extracted. Then the most correlated features were fed into the k-Nearest Neighbor classifier.

Electroencephalography plays an imperative role for diagnosis of epileptic seizures. But since, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are contaminated with artifacts, detection of epileptic activities is a difficult task even for an experienced neurophysiologist. Therefore, development of an automatic epileptic seizure detection system is essential to improve epilepsy diagnosis. Present research proposes a novel method for analyzing EEG signals using its sections to extract features. The developed scheme involved computation of statistical features which were then passed into the least-squares support vector machine classifier with non-linear kernel. The performance of the classifier was tested with ten folds for cross-validation. The developed scheme showed mean accuracy of 97.19 % with 0.065 s computation time.

Therefore, augmentation of such responsive loads with unit commitment process can be effective in resource scheduling of smart grid. This paper attempts to develop a binary fireworks algorithm application solve unit commitment problem along with demand response and wind energy.

With the addition of micro-grids and renewable energy resources, and increasing automation in decision-making enabled by sensors, the grid has become very complex. Research in the area of smart grids shows that the grid is vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In particular, recent studies reveals how false data injection could lead to variety of problems in the smart grid operation. A well-crafted attack can pass the bad data detection systems during state estimation and affect the operation and control of the power grid. In this paper, we build on prior efforts in this space to describe how false data injection attacks can be alleviated using conventional techniques by protecting certain critical sensors in the power system.

Achieving the optimized and coordinated relay setting for such a network, is a significant problem for protection engineers. Optimization model of relay coordination problem is highly non-linear, which consists of optimization of two decisive variables namely plug setting (PS) and time multiplier setting (TMS). In this paper, this optimization problem has been solved by using meta-heuristic technique based differential evolution (DE) algorithm, where the objective function of the optimization problem is considered as the minimization of summation of operating times of all primary relays with added penalty against applied mandatory constraints. The algorithm has been implemented on two systems, IEEE 8-bus system and IEEE 15-bus system. The obtained results of all the system are compared with the other two algorithms available in the literature.

In the power transmission network, the distance relays are sensitive to certain system event such as power swings, which drive the apparent impedance trajectories into the protection zones of the distance relay (zone-3) causing mal-operation of the distance relay, leading to subsequent blackouts. Further, three-phase balanced symmetrical fault detection during power swing is one of the serious concerns for the distance relay operation. This paper proposed a new adaptive protection scheme method based on data-mining models such as DT (decision tree) and RF (random forests) for providing supervisory control to the operation of the conventional distance relays. The proposed scheme is able to distinguish power swings and faults during power swing including fault zone identification for series compensated power transmission network during stress condition like power swing. The proposed scheme has been validated on a 39-bus New England system which is developed on Dig-Silent power factory commercial software (PF4C) platform and the performance indicate that the proposed scheme can reliably enhance the distance relay operation during power swing. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Data-mining model; Decision tree (DT); Phasor measurement unit (PMU); Power swing; Random forests (RF)","Decision trees; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric relays; Fault detection; Phasor measurement units; Power transmission; Units of measurement; Adaptive protection schemes; Apparent impedance; Commercial software; Data mining models; Fault zone identification; Power swings; Random forests; Supervisory control; Data mining","Dubey, R.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India; email: rahul.dubey2011@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",01420615,,IEPSD,,"English","Int J Electr Power Energy Syst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960395874

The robots on the team make independent decisions, coordinate, and cooperate with each other to determine the next positions from their current position in the world map using proposed hybrid IPSO-DV. The proposed scheme adjusts the velocity of the robots by incorporating a vector differential operator inherited from Differential Evolution (DE) in IPSO.

Its diagnosis is usually performed using electroencephalography technique. Since, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are highly susceptible to artifacts, epilepsy diagnosis is often challenging task. In addition, locating the origin of seizure patterns is even more tedious due to the non-linear nature of EEG signals. Therefore, automated seizure detection systems are highly important to overcome the said challenges. In this study, we have designed a procedure which integrates the seizure detection and localization process with ceiling level of efficiency. Here, we evaluated the energy and standard features using 'coiflets' wavelet packets. Then, the feature matrix was reduced by applying fast correlation based filter. Application of 5-Nearest Neighbour classifier resulted in mean accuracy of 99.3515±0.2518 % taking only 0.152±0.0344 seconds for execution.

The wind power generated by permanent magnet brushless dc generator, and the maximum power is captured by a maximum power point technique using a boost converter with an incremental conductance approach. This power is supplied to the consumer loads and surplus power is stored into battery system (BS). BS is attached at dc link of VSC, which provides load leveling during less or no wind conditions. With such combination of energy resources, a reduced rating, diesel engine-driven squirrel cage induction generator feeds loads, and VSC at point of common coupling (PCC) supports the system when the wind generation is unable to meet out the load demand. Back-propagation feed-forward control algorithm is used for VF control of VSC. This controller provides harmonics elimination, load leveling, and reactive power compensation, and also regulates the voltage at PCC. This microgrid is modeled in MATLAB Sim power tools, and simulation results are produced to verify the appropriate working of both the converters and the overall system.

These problems have motivated the development of various automated seizure detection systems that can aid neurophysiologists in accurate diagnosis of epilepsy. The present study is focused on the development of a robust automated system for classification against low levels of supervised training. EEG data from two different repositories are considered for analysis and validation of the proposed system. The signals are decomposed into time-frequency sub-bands till sixth level using dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). All details and last approximation coefficients are used to calculate features viz. energy, standard deviation, root-mean-square, Shannon entropy, mean values and maximum peaks. These feature sets are passed through a general regression neural network (GRNN) for classification with K-fold cross-validation scheme under varying train-to-test ratios. The current model yields ceiling level classification performance (accuracy, sensitivity & specificity) in all combinations of datasets (ictal vs non-ictal) in less than 0.028 s.

QBDSONN exploits the power of quantum computation. It is composed of three second order neighborhood topology based inter-connected layers of neurons (represented by qubits) arranged as input, intermediate and output layers. In the suggested network architecture, the inter-connection weights and activation values are represented by rotation gates. A self-supervised learning algorithm, suggested in this proposed architecture, relies on the steepest descent algorithm. The quantum neurons enjoy full-connectivity in each layer of the network architecture. The image pixels in terms of qubits are self-organized in between the intermediate or hidden and output layers of the QBDSONN architecture using counter-propagation of the quantum states to obviate time consuming quantum back propagation algorithm. In the final phase, quantum measurement is carried out at the output layer to eliminate superposition of the quantum states of the outputs. In order to establish the result, the proposed QBDSONN architecture is applied on an artificial synthetic and on a real life spanner image with different degrees of uniform and Gaussian noises. Experimental results show that QBDSONN outperforms both its classical counterpart and the supervised auto-associative Hopfield network as far as extraction time is concerned and it retains the shapes of the extracted images with great precision. Experiments are also carried out using a linear method named local statistics (Wiener filter) and a nonlinear technique named median filter with adaptive discrete wavelet transformations (DWT) for binary object extraction to show the dominance of the proposed QBDSONN with respect to the quality of extracted images. Finally, a statistical significance of the proposed QBDSONN is reported by applying 2 sample one sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test with the existing methods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","BDSONN; Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; Object extraction; QBDSONN; Quantum computing","Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Discrete wavelet transforms; Extraction; Feature extraction; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image processing; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Median filters; Network layers; Neural networks; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; BDSONN; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; Object extraction; QBDSONN; Quantum Computing; Network architecture","Bhattacharyya, S.; Department of Information Technology, Canal South Road, India; email: dr.siddhartha.bhattacharyya@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",15684946,,,,"English","Appl.

Solar energy is the best potential candidate to drive the global energy demand as well as to curb the pollution levels in earth. The photo voltaic and solar thermal systems are the widely developed present technologies to extract the solar energy for the use of mankind. The photo voltaic systems are widely employed around the world due to its capability of converting the available solar energy into the electrical energy which is the most flexible energy available currently on earth. But the commercial adoption of photo voltaic systems on a wide scale is still dented by the limitation of their lower efficiencies. Hence the methods for improvement in efficiency is on focus to improve the economics of these systems.

A simple, data driven, non parametric technique i.e. k-NN regression is used for the prediction. The prediction of mill variables is helpful for improving controls and optimizing the mill operation. The proposed approach is applied for 5 minute ahead prediction and validated using the actual data obtained from a coal fired power plant in Gujarat, India. © 2016 IEEE.","auto-correlation; coal mill; k-nearest neighbors; non parametric regression; prediction; time series","Coal; Coal fired boilers; Coal fueled furnaces; Computer circuits; Fire tube boilers; Forecasting; Milling (machining); Nearest neighbor search; Pulverized fuel; Reconfigurable hardware; Regression analysis; Time series; Coal mills; Coal-fired power plant; K-nearest neighbors; Milling systems; Non-parametric regression; Non-parametric techniques; Related variables; Time series prediction; Fossil fuel power plants",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509012770,,,"English","Proc.

Efficiency improvement of photovoltaic (PV) cell through every possible method is in focus to improve the energy economics of solar PV technology. Concentrated solar PV systems are one of the contenders for high efficiency solar PV systems. However, along with power enhancement, other parameters like open circuit voltage, short circuit current and fill factor of the solar cells that are used in the module are subjected to variation with concentrated solar PV systems. For an inverter, along with power input, the maximum voltage and current inputs are equally important for effective operation. The variation of these parameters in non-linear fashion makes mathematical modelling difficult and complex. Therefore, in the present experiment, variations in voltage, current, fill factor and module temperatures are examined using V-Trough concentrating system. From the experimental results, the actual voltage dependence on temperature and intensity is found to be more compared to the theoretical estimation. Interesting variation of photovoltaic current of concentrated module has been observed during evening times.

Now, the challenge that is being faced by electricity markets in accommodating available wind power is with the inheritant uncertainty associated with wind generation. In this paper, such uncertainty is handled by assessing the risk of independent system operator (ISO)/ transmission system operator (TSO). The risk of scheduling uncertain wind energy is modeled as balancing cost for ISO in real time market as a function of expected real time energy bids of conventional/thermal generators. The proposed approach is simulated on IEEE 30 bus system and results are compared with deterministic scheduling approach. The effectiveness of proposed approach for wind energy scheduling in day ahead (DA) market is reflected in reduced cost for system operator. It is also observed that, cost savings for ISO increased with an increase in wind uncertainty. However, the cost effectiveness of wind scheduling has reduced the scheduled wind energy in DA market. Therefore, percentage of savings increases with uncertainty margin in the forecasted wind energy at a cost of reduction in scheduled wind energy in DA market. © 2016 IEEE.","balancing costs; Day ahead market; deregulated market; independent system operator (ISO); resource scheduling; transmission system operator (TSO); Wind energy scheduling","Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Costs; Deregulation; Electric power transmission; Electric utilities; Energy resources; Renewable energy resources; Risk assessment; Scheduling; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Day ahead market; Deregulated markets; Independent system operators; Resource-scheduling; Transmission system operators; Power markets",,"Saxena S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467379182,,,"English","IEEE Stud.

This elucidates the need for evaluating the performance of PLC systems by taking into account all these factors. In this paper, we study the performance of a PLC system in the presence of Rayleigh channel gain under the combined effects of Nakagami-m distributed background noise with nonuniformly distributed phase and Middleton class A distributed impulsive noise. We evaluate closed-form expressions of the analytical average bit error rate for different cases depending on the presence or absence of impulsive noise and channel gain.

The places where the renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydro etc. are in abundance can be used to generate electricity by developing microgrid (MG) such as wind- hydro MG. A synchronous reluctance generator (SyRG) is used as a constant speed hydro turbine and a permanent magnet brushless DC generator (PMBLDC) as a variable speed wind turbine. The wind power is converted into electricity and converted into DC power using three phase diode bridge with a boost converter, a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) based perturb and observe (P&O) technique is applied. This power is fed to a battery bank and the consumer loads. The battery bank is attached at DC bus of VSI (Voltage Source Inverter). The SyRG is directly feeding to the AC loads and VSI is connected at the PCC (Point Of Common Coupling). This VSI is also used for the power quality improvements through harmonic suppression of nonlinear loads, voltage regulation during contingencies like load unbalance, reactive power compensation according to the system requirement etc. at PCC. It is capable of providing power balance with various changes. For the appropriate functioning of VSI, a reweighted zero attractor least mean square (RZALMS) control algorithm is applied to generate PWM switching pulses.

The proposed technique eliminates the sympathetic/nuisance tripping in an interconnected distribution system. Nuisance trippings are eliminated by incorporating the additional selectivity constraints in conventional over current relay coordination problem. Whenever the fault is cleared only from one end of the line in bidirectional fault feed lines, transient network configuration comes into existence. Transient network configuration causes the redistribution of fault in the distribution system and leads to further nuisance tripping of relays. This problem in this paper is solved by minimising the operating time gap between primary relays located at near end and far end of a faulty line to the best minimum possible value. The differential search algorithm is applied for optimization of highly non-linear over current relay coordination problem in this paper. The result presented in this paper shows that the proposed over current relay coordination technique is immune against the sympathetic/nuisance tripping and operating time difference between primary relays at near end and far end is also minimised within acceptable time margin successfully. © 2016 by De Gruyter 2016.","differential search algorithm; distribution system; relay coordination; sympathetic trippings; transient network configuration","Algorithms; Learning algorithms; Optimization; Distribution systems; Relay coordination; Search Algorithms; sympathetic trippings; Transient network; Electric power system protection","Singh, M.; Power System Division, India; email: manoharsingh@cpri.in",,"Walter de Gruyter GmbH",21945756,,,,"English","Int.

The proposed approach embedded the social essence of IPSO with motion mechanism of IGSA. The proposed hybridization IPSO–IGSA maintain the efficient balance between exploration and exploitation because of adopting co-evolutionary techniques to update the IGSA acceleration and particle positions with IPSO velocity simultaneously. The objective of the algorithm is to minimize the maximum path length that corresponds to minimize the arrival time of all robots to their respective destination in the environment. The robot on the team make independent decisions, coordinate, and cooperate with each other to determine the next positions from their current position in the world map using proposed hybrid IPSO–IGSA. Finally the analytical and experimental results of the multi-robot path planning were compared to those obtained by IPSO–IGSA, IPSO, IGSA in a similar environment.

Thus, effective scheduling of both resources holds the key to sustainable practice. This paper presents a scheduling scenario-based approach in the smart grid. Problem formulation with dual objective function including both emissions and cost is developed for conventional unit commitment with EV and RET deployment.

Introduction of DGs into distribution system cause changes in the fault current levels & directions, thus results in inaccurate operation of the existing protection system. Fault currents in the system also varies significantly following the transition of grid-connected and islanded operational modes of microgrid. Procuring a coordinated protection system which operates accurately in DGs integrated scenario is still a challenging aspect for the planners. In this paper, protection system has been proposed which is suitable for both grid-connected and islanded operational modes of microgrid.

This study presents an analytical approach for finding the possible impacts of shunt connected flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices such as static synchronous compensator/static volt-ampere reactive (VAR) compensator (SVC) integrated with off-shore wind farm (WF) on distance relay characteristics. Analytical results are presented and verified on simulation platform compares under reach phenomena in presence of both FACTS devices and it is found that under reach is more severe for SVC connected system. Moreover, presence of SVC changes the line characteristic presented to relay even for bolted faults. It is also seen that type of coupling transformer has a considerable effect on apparent impedance. Furthermore, the reach setting of the relay is significantly affected as the relay end voltage and power fluctuates continuously (due to non-linear relationship with speed) when off-shore WFs are connected to power transmission systems. Thus, adaptive tripping characteristics for high resistance line-to-ground fault with shunt-FACTS devices considering appropriate operating conditions is a demanding concern and the same has been addressed in the proposed research work. © 2016.

The EHN is assumed to have a power splitter (PS) at the receiver to decode information and harvest energy simultaneously from the SBS transmission, thus reducing the secrecy capacity of SBS. Since both the SBS and the malicious EHN are selfish with conflicting interests, we model the interaction between them as a non-cooperative Stackelberg game. The objective of the SBS is to maximize the secrecy rate and minimize its interference at the PR, whereas the EHN aims at maximizing both the energy it can harvest and the information it can decode from the received SBS signal. The existence of a unique equilibrium point is proved through mathematical analysis. Further, a distributed algorithm is proposed, following which the players will attain the equilibrium of the game as predicted by analytical results.

Fractals are created around a random initial solution by employing a suitable stochastic technique. The generated particles then explore the search space in an efficient manner using diffusion property of random fractal. For overall fitness evaluation of the multiple Pareto optimal solutions TOPSIS (technique for order preference similar to an ideal solution) is employed. To validate the performance of the proposed method on practical constrained optimization problems analysis has been carried out on standard 10 and 13 generating unit systems. Results of stochastic fractal search algorithm with weighted sum method (SFSA_WS) are compared with SFSA with TOPSIS (SFSA_TOP) method.

High price volatilities, price spikes caused by a number of factors such as weather uncertainty, fluctuating fuel prices, transmission bottlenecks, etc., make the task of accurate price forecasting a formidable challenge for the market participants. A number of models have been proposed by researchers; however, achieving high accuracy is always not possible. In some specific applications such as self-scheduling by demand side participants, certain price thresholds are more useful than accurate price forecasts. In this paper, we have investigated the application of a novel neural network-based technique called extreme learning machine for the problem of classification of future electricity prices with respect to certain price thresholds. Different models corresponding to different lead times are developed and tested with data corresponding to Ontario and PJM markets. It is observed that classification with ELM is fast, less sensitive to user defined parameters and easily implementable. © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.","Classification; Deregulation; Electricity price; Extreme learning machine; Neural networks","Classification (of information); Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Neural networks; Deregulated power markets; Electricity prices; Extreme learning machine; Forecasting electricity; Market participants; Novel neural network; Price forecasting; User-defined parameters; Learning systems","Shrivastava, N.A.; Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Hauz Khas, India; email: anandnitin26@gmail.com",,"Springer-Verlag London Ltd",09410643,,,,"English","Neural Comput.

The performance of a PLC system is significantly affected by the additive and multiplicative power line noises; the additive noises are of two types, namely background noise and impulsive noise. Whereas, the multiplicative PLC noise leads to fading in the received signal strength. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a PLC system over log-normal fading channel under Nakagami-m distributed additive background noise assuming binary phase shift keying modulation scheme. The analysis involving log-normal fading is very complicated. Hence we use a novel gamma approximation to log-normal distribution for our analysis. We evaluate the probability density function of the decision variable. A closed-form expression of the analytical average bit error rate of the considered system is derived. We also compute the diversity order of the considered PLC system. The validity of the derived analytical expressions is closely verified by the simulation results. © 2015 IEEE.","Background noise; bit error rate; log-normal fading; Nakagami-m distribution; power line communications","Additive noise; Binary phase shift keying; Electric power measurement; Fading (radio); Fading channels; Impulse noise; Normal distribution; Optical communication; Phase shift; Phase shift keying; Phase shifters; Probability density function; Radio communication; Background noise; Binary phase-shift keying modulations; Log-normal distribution; Log-normal fading; Nakagami-m distribution; Power line communications; Power line communications (PLC); Received signal strength; Bit error rate",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467367820,,,"English","IEEE Int Symp Person Indoor Mobile Radio Commun PIMRC",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958050676

Rather than a simple approach of optimizing micro grid operation to minimize line loss in the micro grid, this paper deals with multi objective optimization to minimize line loss, operational cost and maximize the value of stored energy of URFC and EV simultaneously. Apart from URFC, two operation strategies are proposed for EV enabling V2G operation to reduce overall system cost of operation. To address the complexity, non-linearity and multi dimensionality of the objective function, particle swarm optimization-a heuristic approach based solution methodology along with forward and back sweep algorithm based load flow solution technique is developed. Combined with particle swarm optimization (PSO), forward and backward sweep algorithm resolves the complexity and multi dimensionality of the load flow analysis and optimizes the operational cost of micro grid. The simulation results are presented and discussed which are promising with regard to reduction in line loss as well as cost of operation.

Due to its unpredictable nature, integration of wind power into the conventional power grid is a very challenging task having dynamic characteristics. Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with wind availability, additional spinning reserve needs to be scheduled in order to maintain security and supply reliability. Multi-period multi-objective optimal dispatch (MPMOOD) is presented for wind integrated power system with reserve constraints. The complex relationship between wind power availability, spinning reserve allocation and their impact on economic/environmental cost are analysed using an elaborate model. A new multi-objective Series PSO-DE (SPSO-DE) hybrid algorithm is proposed where the two paradigms, differential evolution (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) share domain information and maintain a synergistic cooperation to overcome their individual weaknesses. For multi-objective (MO) problems, the selection operation in SPSO-DE is replaced by a 5-class time-varying fuzzy selection mechanism (TVFSM) to avoid saturation and to increase Pareto diversity. To promote convergence towards the central part of the Pareto front and to quickly isolate the boundary solutions, Guassian membership function is employed. Elitism is applied to preserve good solutions and momentum operation is used to stop premature convergence. The proposed method expedites the search for the best solution, i.e. the solution which satisfies all the objectives of the MO problems. To test the performance and computational efficiency, the proposed method is applied on two standard test power systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a solution of dynamic multi objective optimal dispatch (DMOOD) for wind-thermal system using a hybrid flower pollination algorithm (HFPA). Simultaneous minimization of cost, emission and losses is carried out with complex constraints like valve point loadings, ramp limits, prohibited zones and spinning reserve. The cost of wind power uncertainty is also included in the cost function by using a probability density function model. The proposed HFPA improves the exploration and exploitation potential of the flower population which is conducting the search. In the HFPA the flower pollination algorithm (FPA) and differential evolution (DE) algorithm are integrated to preserve good solutions and to stop premature convergence. A 5-class, 3-step time varying fuzzy selection mechanism (TVFSM) is integrated with HFPA for solving multi-objective problems. The TVFSM finds a fuzzy selection index (FSI) by aggregating different conflicting objectives. The FSI is adopted as the merit criterion while updating the population. Guassian membership function is applied to compute FSI in such a manner that extreme solutions are filtered out and trade off solutions on the central portion of the Pareto-front are obtained. The HFPA-TVFSM approach effectively searches the best compromise solution (BCS) which satisfies all the three objectives maximally.

Present study showcased an expert system design for automated classification of ictal activities in electroencephalogram signals. The development used 'coiflets' wavelet packets for decomposition of signals to extract energy, standard deviation and Shannon entropy as features. Followed by support vector machine classifier with feds of various feature sets combinations. In the presented scheme, standard deviation feature set proved to be the best input features. It showed mean classification accuracy = 99.46 %, sensitivity = 99.40 % and specificity = 99.48 % with computation time = 5.60e-04 s.

It is essential to quantify uncertainties associated with wind power generation forecasts for their efficient application in optimal management of wind farms and integration into power systems. Prediction intervals (PIs) are well known statistical tools which are used to quantify the uncertainty related to forecasts by estimating the ranges of the future target variables. This paper investigates the application of a novel support vector machine based methodology to directly estimate the lower and upper bounds of the PIs without expensive computational burden and inaccurate assumptions about the distribution of the data. The efficiency of the method for uncertainty quantification is examined using monthly data from a wind farm in Australia. PIs for short term application are generated with a confidence level of 90%. Experimental results confirm the ability of the method in constructing reliable PIs without resorting to complex computational methods. © 2015 IEEE.","Prediction interval; support vector machine; uncertainty; wind power","Complex networks; Electric power generation; Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Statistical mechanics; Support vector machines; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Computational burden; Lower and upper bounds; Market participants; Optimal management; Power generation forecasts; Prediction interval; uncertainty; Uncertainty quantifications; Weather forecasting",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479919604; 9781479919604; 9781479919604; 9781479919604,85OFA,,"English","Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951133044

It is composed of three second order neighborhood topology based interconnected layers of neurons (represented by qubits) known as input, intermediate and output layers. Moreover, it does not use any quantum back-propagation algorithm for the adjustment of its interconnection weights. Instead, it resorts to a counter-propagation of quantum states of the intermediate layer and the output layer. In the proposed architecture, the inter-connection weights and activation values are represented by rotation gates. The quantum neurons of each network layer follow a cellular network pattern and are fully intra-connected to each other. QBDSONN self-organizes the quantized input image information by means of the counter-propagating fashion of the quantum network states of the intermediate and output layers of the architecture. A quantum measurement at the output layer collapses superposition of quantum states of the processed information thereby yielding the desired outputs once the network attains stability. Applications of QBDSONN are demonstrated on the denoising of a synthetic and real life spanner image with different degrees of uniform noise and Gaussian noise. Comparative results indicate that QBDSONN outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of time and also it retains the shapes of the denoised images with great precision. © 2015 IEEE.","Bi-directional self-organizing neural network; Binary object extraction; Quantum bidirectional self-organizing neural network; Quantum Computing","Backpropagation; Binary images; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image denoising; Network architecture; Network layers; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Binary objects; Classical counterpart; Interconnection weight; Neighborhood topology; Processed information; Proposed architectures; Quantum Computing; Self-organizing neural network; Neural networks",,"Mauri J.L.Thampi S.M.Wozniak M.Marques O.Krishnaswamy D.Sahni S.Callegari C.Takagi H.Bojkovic Z.S.Vinod M.Prasad N.R.Alcaraz Calero J.M.Rodrigues J.Rodrigues J.Que X.Meghanathan N.Sandhu R.Au E.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479987917,,,"English","Int.

Amongst different levels of information fusion, very few approaches exist in literature exploring score level fusion. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive weight and exponent based function mapping the matching scores from different biometric sources into a single amalgamated matching score to be used by a classifier for further decision making. Differential Evolution (DE) has been employed to adjust these tunable parameters with the objective being the minimization of the overlapping area of the frequency distributions of genuine and imposter scores in the fused score space, which are estimated by Gaussian kernel density method to achieve higher level of accuracy. Experimental results show that, the proposed method outperforms the conventional score-level fusion rules (sum, product, tanh, exponential) when tested on two databases of 4 modalities (fingerprint, iris, left ear and right ear) of 200 and 516 users and thus confirms the effectiveness of score level fusion.

It is an emerging field of communication for the home area network of smart grid. The presence of the additive and multiplicative power line noises significantly affects the performance of PLC systems. There are two types of additive noises in PLC systems, namely background noise and impulsive noise. The multiplicative PLC noise results in fading in the received signal strength. The Rician fading model has been experimentally found to be applicable to the PLC systems and has been widely used in conventional and current literature on PLC. In this paper, we provide the performance analysis of a PLC system over Rician fading channel under Nakagami-m distributed additive background noise assuming binary phase shift keying modulation scheme. We derive the probability density function of the decision variable and the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A closed-form expression of the outage probability of the considered system is obtained.

The constraints imposed from the operation point of view are the limits on generator real power and reactive power outputs, bus voltages and power flow in the transmission lines. The proposed work also includes the effect of having non-smooth cost characteristics of the thermal generators which arises because of the valve point loading effect.

The situation is complicated by the fact that the variation of groundwater level is highly nonlinear in nature because of interdependencies and uncertainties in the hydro-geological process. Models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have proved to be effective in modeling virtually any nonlinear function with a greater degree of accuracy. In recent times, combining several techniques to form a hybrid tool to improve the accuracy of prediction has become a common practice for various applications. This integrated method increases the efficiency of the model by combining the unique features of the constituent models to capture different patterns in the data. In the present study, an attempt is made to predict monthly groundwater level fluctuations using integrated wavelet and support vector machine modeling. The discrete wavelet transform with two coefficients (db2 wavelet) is adopted for decomposing the input data into wavelet series. These series are further used as input variables in different combinations for Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to forecast groundwater level fluctuations. The monthly data of precipitation, maximum temperature, mean temperature and groundwater depth for the period 2001-2012 are used as the input variables. The proposed Wavelet-Support Vector Regression (WA-SVR) model is applied to predict the groundwater level variations for three observation wells in the city of Visakhapatnam, India. The performance of the WA-SVR model is compared with SVR, ANN and also with the traditional Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. Results indicate that WA-SVR model gives better accuracy in predicting groundwater levels in the study area when compared to other models. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Groundwater level; Predicting; Support vector regression; Wavelet transform","Discrete wavelet transforms; Forecasting; Groundwater; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Auto regressive integrated moving average models; Groundwater level fluctuation; Groundwater level variation; Maximum temperature; Predicting; Support vector machine models; Support vector regression (SVR); Water resources management; Groundwater resources; ground water; accuracy; article; artificial neural network; environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; groundwater level; hydrology; India; intermethod comparison; mathematical model; meteorology; precipitation; prediction; priority journal; process development; regression analysis; reliability; support vector machine; validation process; water temperature; wavelet analysis; wavelet support vector regression model","Suryanarayana, C.; Department of Civil Engineering, Gayatri Vidya Parishad College of Engineering, Visakhapatnam, A.P., India; email: snarayana108@gmail.com",,"Elsevier",09252312,,NRCGE,,"English","Neurocomputing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906935363

In existing over current relay coordination algorithms, it is observed that operating time gaps between primaries over current relays at near end and far end of faulted line are quite enough. This time gaps may redistribute the fault currents in the power networks which leads to cascading type of over current relay miscoordination in a properly coordinated power network. In this paper, the over current relay coordination problem formulation is modified in such a way to minimize the operating time gap between the primary over current relays at near and far ends with in a desired time margin such that the chance of redistribution of fault currents in the distribution network is eliminated.

Generating relay tripping characteristics is one of the challenging issues for transmission line distance relays as the present day transmission systems is subjected to a more stressed environment with respect to power system operation. Moreover, inclusion of FACTS devices such as UPFC in the transmission system seriously impacts the performance of the distance relays as the apparent impedance changes. Furthermore, the reach setting of the relay is significantly affected as the relay end voltage fluctuates continuously when off-shore wind-farms are connected to power transmission systems. Thus, generating tripping characteristics for appropriate operating conditions is a demanding concern and the same has been addressed in the proposed research work. Extensive testing is carried out in generating relay tripping characteristics with possible variations under the operating conditions of UPFC and wind-farm and it is observed that the characteristics are significantly affected for different operating conditions.

As a consequence, forecasting problems are becoming more and more challenging and ridden with uncertainty. Such uncertainties are generally quantified by statistical tools such as prediction intervals (Pis). Pis quantify the uncertainty related to forecasts by estimating the ranges of the targeted quantities. Pis generated by traditional neural network based approaches are limited by high computational burden and impractical assumptions about the distribution of the data. A novel technique for constructing high quality Pis using support vector machines (SVMs) is being proposed in this paper. The proposed technique directly estimates the upper and lower bounds of the PI in a short time and without any assumptions about the data distribution. The SVM parameters are tuned using particle swarm optimization technique by minimization of a modified Pi-based objective function. Electricity price and demand data of the Ontario electricity market is used to validate the performance of the proposed technique. Several case studies for different months indicate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of high quality PI generation and shorter computational times. © 2014 IEEE.","Deregulation; Particle swarm optimization; Prediction interval; Support vector machines; Uncertainty","Costs; Crude oil price; Deregulation; Forecasting; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Statistical mechanics; Uncertainty analysis; Forecasting problems; Network-based approach; Ontario electricity markets; Particle swarm optimization technique; Prediction interval; Support vector machine (SVMs); Uncertainty; Upper and lower bounds; Support vector machines","Shrivastava, N.A.; Department of Electrical Engineering, India",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479914845,85OFA,,"English","Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908469351

In this study, a novel method based on coupling the Firefly Algorithm (FFA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) has been proposed to forecast the malaria incidences. The performance of SVM models depends upon the appropriate choice of SVM parameters. In this study FFA has been employed for determining the parameters of SVM. The proposed SVM-FFA model has been adopted in predicting the malarial incidences in Jodhpur and Bikaner area where the malaria transmission is unstable. Monthly averages of rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and malarial incidences have been considered as input variables. Time series of monthly notifications of malaria cases has been obtained from primary health centers and from other local health facilities for a period of January 1998 to December 2002 in the region of Bikaner and from January 1998 to December 2000 in Jodhpur region. Further, the rainfall, relative humidity and temperature data have been obtained from meteorological records. The performance of the proposed SVM-FFA model has been compared with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Auto-Regressive Moving Average method and also with Support Vector Machine. The results indicate that the proposed SVM-FFA model provides more accurate forecasts compared to the other traditional techniques. Further, it has been recommended to carry out additional strides to explore the utility and efficacy of SVM-FFA model.

This paper discusses the application of informative differential evolution algorithm with self adaptive re-clustering technique for selection of TDS and PSM for optimal coordination of directional overcurrent relays. Both continuous as well as discrete version of informative differential evolution algorithm are used for optimization of relay setting. Proper combination of backup relays for each primary relay are identified by using LINKNET graph theory approach. Coordination of directional overcurrent is developed for 9 bus and IEEE 30 bus distribution systems. The aim of problem is to minimize the total operating time of primary relays and eliminate the miscoordination among the primary and backup relay pairs. Discrete types of settings for electromechanical types of relay are also discussed in this paper. Moreover, the relay coordination problem is modified for providing optimal coordination time interval between 0.2 and 0.8. s among all primary and backup relays pairs.

The quality of the image acquired depends greatly on the type of image acquisition systems. Sometimes these systems fail to give the good results and we need to process the image to get the desired information. In this paper we will discuss the Multi-focus images and their fusion. A multi-focus image is the result of the inability of the acquisition system to acquire the image up to the desired field of depth. So here we are trying to find a best solution for fusion of multi-focus images considering the simplicity of algorithm with respect to different quantitative measures. In our previous work we have worked on the multimodality image fusion with image database of CT and MRI machines to combine complementary information from two images. Now in current work we are trying to extend the application of the proposed method to Multi-focus images.

Wind AC power generated by permanent magnet brushless DC generator (PMBLDC) is rectified into DC power, and maximum power is captured using maximum power point technique (MPPT) using a boost converter with incremental conductance (INC) approach. This power is stored into battery system (BS) and surplus is supplied to the consumer loads. BS is attached at DC link of VSC which provides load leveling during less or no wind conditions. Diesel engine driven squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG) is feeding loads and VSC at point of common coupling (PCC) to support the system when wind generation is unable to meet out load demand. Back propagation feed forward (BPFF) control scheme is used for VF control of VSC. This controller provides harmonics elimination, load leveling and reactive power compensation and also regulates the voltage at PCC.

This paper presents a new evolutionary optimisation algorithm to solve the optimal reactive power dispatch problem with operational constraints using the improved seeker optimisation algorithm (ISOA). In this paper, we improvise the step length determination strategy in the conventional seeker optimisation method by considering an optimistically contracting step length calculation. The feasibility of the proposed approach was tested on IEEE 30-bus system with three different single objectives like minimise the total real power loss, improve the load bus voltage profile and improve the voltage stability index. Simulation result obtained reveals the robustness and ability of the proposed methodology over other existing techniques recently reported in the literature. An innovative statistical analysis based on central tendency measures and dispersion measures were carried out on the three different single objectives.

A nonlinear method viz., Extreme learning machine (ELM) has been employed on general circulation model (GCM) products to make the multi-model ensemble (MME) based estimation of NEM rainfall (NEMR). The ELM is basically is an improved learning algorithm for the single feed-forward neural network (SLFN) architecture. The 27 year (1982-2008) lead-1 (using initial conditions of September for forecasting the mean rainfall of OND) hindcast runs (1982-2008) from seven GCM has been used to make MME. The improvement of the proposed method with respect to other regular MME (simple arithmetic mean of GCMs (EM) and singular value decomposition based multiple linear regressions based MME) has been assessed through several skill metrics like Spread distribution, multiplicative bias, prediction errors, the yield of prediction, Pearson's and Kendal's correlation coefficient and Wilmort's index of agreement. The efficiency of ELM estimated rainfall is established by all the stated skill scores. The performance of ELM in extreme NEMR years, out of which 4 years are characterized by deficit rainfall and 5 years are identified as excess, is also examined. It is found that the ELM could expeditiously capture these extremes reasonably well as compared to the other MME approaches. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Artificial neural network; Extreme learning machine; General circulation models; Multi-model ensemble; Northeast monsoon rainfall","algorithm; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; ensemble forecasting; error analysis; general circulation model; hindcasting; monsoon; performance assessment; rainfall; India","Acharya, N.; Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, 110016, India; email: nachiketaacharya@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",09307575,,,,"English","Clim.

Since the problem is nondeterministic polynomial hard and combinatorial with huge solution space, metaheuristic techniques, despite being computationally expensive, have been used. The proposed approach combines the strengths of a gradient technique and a metaheuristic technique. In the first phase, the primal-dual interior point method (PDIPM) treats the discrete variables as continuous. These are then discretized using PDIPM-based sensitivities. These two solutions provide heuristic bounds on controls which are used in the second phase by a metaheuristic algorithm. The bounds aid in limiting the number of controls' combinations. Results for two systems have been obtained which ascertain the potential of the proposed approach over the conventional metaheuristic technique. These also indicate approximately 30-35 times increase in speed with the proposed algorithm compared to the conventional one. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Discrete controls; distribution system; interior point method (IPM); sensitivity; volt/var optimization","Optimization; Discrete Control; Distribution systems; Interior point methods; sensitivity; Volt/var optimizations; Local area networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",08858977,,ITPDE,,"English","IEEE Trans Power Delivery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905119157

Incipient fault detection has received reasonable attention in recent years. In this paper, a method based on complex wavelets is proposed for incipient fault detection and condition monitoring. A complex wavelet-support vector machine (SVM) classifier-based method is developed which takes into account four conditions: healthy, turn fault (TF) under balanced supply conditions, voltage imbalance, and interturn fault with voltage imbalance, both occurring at the same time. The performance metrics show the ability of the technique to identify the fault at an early stage and it also provides additional information regarding which of the four conditions is prevailing at a given time. Voltage imbalance and turn fault are often confused. Both affect the performance of the machine and the unbalanced voltage condition considerably reduces the winding insulation life due to overheating. This necessitates the precise identification of the supply condition along with the fault diagnosis. A comparison of the proposed method with standard discrete wavelet transform (DWT) shows its effectiveness in providing reliable information under variable supply-frequency conditions. The proposed technique is also tested in presence of high resistance connections (HRCs), which shows its isolating capability. © 2014 IEEE.","condition monitoring; Discrete wavelet transforms; fault diagnosis; support vector machines; voltage imbalance","Condition monitoring; Discrete wavelet transforms; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Analytical wavelets; Incipient fault detection; Induction machines; Performance metrics; Supply conditions; Unbalanced voltage condition; Voltage imbalance; Winding insulation; Support vector machines",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00939994,,ITIAC,,"English","IEEE Trans Ind Appl",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901314288

The main challenge in such methods is the computational complexity due to the huge size of the network, and in pruning a large number of parameters. In this paper, a nearly shift insensitive complex wavelet-based probabilistic neural network (PNN) model, which has only a single parameter to be optimized, is proposed for interturn fault detection. The algorithm constitutes two parts and runs in an iterative way. In the first part, the PNN structure determination has been discussed, which finds out the optimum size of the network using an orthogonal least squares regression algorithm, thereby reducing its size. In the second part, a Bayesian classifier fusion has been recommended as an effective solution for deciding the machine condition. The testing accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values are highest for the product rule-based fusion scheme, which is obtained under load, supply, and frequency variations. The point of overfitting of PNN is determined, which reduces the size, without compromising the performance.

SVMs are proved to be a good tool for forecasting the nonlinear time series. But the performance of the SVM depends solely upon the appropriate choice of parameters. Hence, particle swarm optimization technique is employed in tuning SVM parameters. The proposed SVM-PSO model is used in forecasting the streamflow values of Swan River near Bigfork and St. Regis River near Clark Fork of Montana, United States. Further SVM model with various input structures is constructed, and the best structure is determined using various statistical performances. Later, the performance of the SVM model is compared with the autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) and artificial neural networks (ANN's).

The economic load dispatch (ELD) is a complex optimisation problem due to non-linear, non-convex type fuel cost characteristics of the fossil fuel operated thermal generators.

Co-ordinated preventive and corrective rescheduling actions attempt to make the system correctively secure with respect to these detrimental contingencies. This is an iterative process and is also computationally onerous. This paper attempts to reduce this burden in a twofold manner: firstly, by developing an OPF index based method for quick identification of infeasible post-contingencies and secondly, by reducing these indices for identified infeasible contingencies in a preventive rescheduling manner. Hence, a non-iterative Primal-Dual Interior Point Method (PDIPM) based OPF approach, requiring only one common pre-contingency Hessian factorization in all the critical contingencies, is proposed for fast identification of infeasible outages. The preventive OPF thus performed is also efficient as indices for identified infeasible contingencies are used as constraints and full OPF solutions for all critical post-contingencies are completely avoided.

Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in general exists in every game with a finite set of actions. Correlated equilibrium is a new solution concept in game theory that is more general than Nash Equilibrium and can be formulated with more accuracy on solutions. In this paper a Correlated Equilibrium based control has been extended to an Islanded Microgrid structure which depicts that scenario in smart-grids when it is isolated from the main power supply during power scarcity. The game theory based control has been shown to perform exceedingly well for the islanded scenario considering multi-agent structure. The individual agents are segregated by a superagent as potential buyers and sellers.A novel problem formulation is proposed and a Constrained variant of a newly proposed Differential Evolution Algorithm, ADE-LbX has been used for solving the non linear optimization problem. The final outcome has shown that the overall utility or satisfaction of agents is maximized extensively after energy trading besides maintaining trade advantage for each agent. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.",,"Correlated equilibria; Differential evolution algorithms; Individual agent; Islanded microgrid; Non-linear optimization problems; Problem formulation; Reliable power supply; Solution concepts; Commerce; Electric power distribution; Mathematical models; Smart power grids; Game theory","Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering Department, India",,,03029743,9783319037554,,,"English","Lect.

These changes in the network would lead to operational inconsistency of directional overcurrent relays. To overcome this problem, a set of new coordination constraints corresponding to each network topology needs to be formulated. Directional Overcurrent Relays (ODCRs) problem can be formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem and also in addition to nonlinearity, the optimization problem encounter a large number of coordination constraints. This paper presents a modified Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to handle such type of Optimal Directional Overcurrent Relays problem. Modified DE computes the optimal time dial setting and pickup current setting in terms of discrete values which collectively minimize the total operating time of the relays. To verify the performance of the proposed method, similar evolutionary computation methods such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA) approaches are also implemented using the same database. The proposed method has been verified on 8-bus test system. The results indicate that the proposed method can obtain better results than the method compared in terms of total operating time and convergence performance for both fixed and changed network topologies. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.","Differential Evolution Algorithm; Directional overcurrent relays; Pickup current settings; Relay coordination; Time dial settings; Time multiplier settings","Differential evolution algorithms; Directional over-current relays; Pickup current settings (Ip); Relay coordination; Time Dial Settings; Time Multiplier Settings; Electric relays; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Overcurrent protection; Pickups; Electric network topology","Electrical Instrumentation and Control Engineering, , Bhubaneswar, India",,,03029743,9783319037554,,,"English","Lect.

The modeling of loads as voltage dependent is implemented so as to analyze the effect on load served maximization and voltage stability enhancement index. The former tries to serve the maximum loads and the later maintains the flat profile of the voltages to avoid the voltage collapse on overloading and fault situations.

Barring a few cases, the deregulated structure is doing quite well in most of the countries. However a persistent issue that plagues the involved parties such as producers, traders, retailers etc., is the uncertainty that prevails in the system. Due to a number of known, unknown factors, the electricity prices exhibit fluctuating characteristics which is difficult to control as well as predict. Several forecasting techniques have been developed and successfully implemented for existing markets around the world with comparable performance. However, the uncertainty aspect of the point forecasts has not been analyzed significantly.

Presently, artificial intelligence techniques are applied for optimal co-ordination of directional overcurrent relays. This paper discusses the application of Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm for optimal coordination of DOCR relays in a looped power system. Combination of primary and backup relay is chosen by using Far vector of LINKNET structure, to avoid mis-coordination of relays.

To address this limitation, authors present a memetic algorithm (MA) named as aBBOmDE, which is a new variant of BBO. In aBBOmDE, the performance of BBO is accelerated with the help of a modified mutation and clear duplicate operators. Then modified DE (mDE) is embedded as a neighborhood search operator to improve the fitness from a predefined threshold. mDE is used with mutation operator DE/best/1/bin to explore the search near the best solution. The length of local search is a choice that balances between the search capability and the computational cost. In aBBOmDE, migration mechanism is kept same as that of BBO in order to maintain its exploitation ability. Modified operators are utilized to enhance the exploration ability while a neighborhood search operator further enhances the search capability of the algorithm. This combination significantly improves the convergence characteristics of the original algorithm. Extensive experiments have been carried out on forty benchmark functions to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results have been compared with original BBO, DE, CMAES, other MA and DE/BBO, a hybrid version of DE and BBO. aBBOmDE is also applied to compute patch dimensions of rectangular microstrip patch antennas (MSAs) with various substrate thicknesses so as to be used a CAD formula for antenna design. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Biogeography-based optimization (BBO); Convergence; Evolutionary optimization; Memetic algorithm (MA); Neighborhood search; Rectangular microstrip patch antennas (MSAs)","Biogeographybased optimizations (BBO); Convergence; Evolutionary optimizations; Memetic algorithms; Neighborhood search; Rectangular microstrip patch; Microstrip antennas; Optimization; Heuristic algorithms","Lohokare, M.R.; National Institute of Technical Teachers' Training and Research Chandigarh, , Chandigarh 160019, India; email: mohanlohokare@gmail.com",,,15684946,,,,"English","Appl.

However, the information of streamflow presents a challenging situation; the streamflow forecasting involves a rather complex nonlinear data pattern. In the recent years, the support vector machine has been used widely to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. This study investigates the accuracy of the hybrid SVM-QPSO model (support vector machine-quantum behaved particle swarm optimization) in predicting monthly streamflows. The proposed SVM-QPSO model is employed in forecasting the streamflow values of Vijayawada station and Polavaram station of Andhra Pradesh in India. The SVM model with various input structures is constructed and the best structure is determined using normalized mean square error (NMSE) and correlation coefficient (R). Further quantum behaved particle swarm optimization function is adapted in this study to determine the optimal values of SVM parameters by minimizing NMSE. Later, the performance of the SVM-QPSO model is compared thoroughly with the popular forecasting models. The results indicate that SVM-QPSO is a far better technique for predicting monthly streamflows as it provides a high degree of accuracy and reliability. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Forecasting; QPSO; Streamflow; SVM; Time series","Andhra Pradesh; Correlation coefficient; Forecasting models; High degree of accuracy; Non-linear regression; Nonlinear data; Normalized mean square error; Optimal values; QPSO; Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization; Streamflow forecasting; Support vector; SVM; SVM model; Forecasting; Image retrieval; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Stream flow; Time series; Water resources; Support vector machines; accuracy; algorithm; article; calculation; case study; correlation coefficient; forecasting; intermethod comparison; mathematical computing; mathematical model; Monte Carlo method; priority journal; process development; process optimization; quantum theory; simulation; support vector machine","Ch, S.; Department of Civil Engineering, , Hauzkhas, New Delhi, India; email: sudheer108@gmail.com",,,09252312,,NRCGE,,"English","Neurocomputing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868623982

In this study metaheuristic hybrid algorithm has been used to obtain Paretos for in-situ bioremediation of groundwater. Further, the performance of Paretos obtained with varying population size has been evaluated. The results indicate that too small or too large population size does not give well spaced Paretos. Only the population size in specific range shows better performance in the present study for groundwater remediation. The cost analysis of in-situ bioremediation based on the Paretos obtained from proposed hybrid algorithm shows that percentage increase in cost increases as the clean up standard of groundwater increases.

For deployment of sensor nodes some of the key objectives that need to be satisfied are coverage of the area to be monitored, net energy consumed by the WSN, lifetime of the network, and connectivity and number of deployed sensors. In this article the sensor node deployment task has been formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization (MO) problem where the aim is to find a deployed sensor node arrangement to maximize the area of coverage, minimize the net energy consumption, maximize the network lifetime, and minimize the number of deployed sensor nodes while maintaining connectivity between each sensor node and the sink node for proper data transmission. We assume a tree structure between the deployed nodes and the sink node for data transmission. Our method employs a recently developed and very competitive multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) known as MOEA/D-DE that uses a decomposition approach for converting the problem of approximation of the Pareto fronts (PF) into a number of single-objective optimization problems. This algorithm employs differential evolution (DE), one of the most powerful real parameter optimizers in current use, as its search method. The original MOEA/D has been modified by introducing a new fuzzy dominance based decomposition technique. The algorithm introduces a fuzzy Pareto dominance concept to compare two solutions and uses the scalar decomposition method only when one of the solutions fails to dominate the other in terms of a fuzzy dominance level. We have compared the performance of the resulting algorithm, called MOEA/DFD, with the original MOEA/D-DE and another very popular MOEA called Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). The best trade-off solutions from MOEA/DFD based node deployment scheme have also been compared with a few single-objective node deployment schemes based on the original DE, an adaptive DE-variant (JADE), original particle swarm optimization (PSO), and a state-of-the art variant of PSO (Comprehensive Learning PSO). In all the test instances, MOEA/DFD performs better than all other algorithms. Also the proposed multi-objective formulation of the problem adds more flexibility to the decision maker for choosing the necessary threshold of the objectives to be satisfied. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The penetration of DG influences the PQ levels in the distribution networks. Islanding disturbances are separated out from the PQ disturbances based on the selection of suitable threshold value, at the initial stage of classification process. Further, the power quality disturbances are automatically classified into distinct classes based on feature extraction using S-transform followed by training of two classifiers, namely, modular probabilistic neural network (MPNN) and support vector machines (SVMs). Five different types of disturbances are considered for the classification problem. The study reveals that S-transform (ST) in association with MPNN and SVM can effectively detect and classify islanding and PQ disturbances. The proposed methodology uses features instead of real data set and thereby reduces the data size to classify disturbance signal without losing its original property. The accuracy and reliability of proposed classifier is also tested on signals contaminated with noise and PQ disturbances caused due to wind speed variation on an experimental prototype set-up. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The GEP algorithms as evolutionary algorithms for pattern classification have recently received attention for classification problems because they can perform global searches. The proposed methodology applies the GEP for the first time in transient security assessment and classification problems of power systems. The proposed algorithm is examined using different IEEE standard test systems. Power system three phase short circuit contingency has been used to test the proposed algorithm. The algorithm checks the static security status of the power system then classifies the transient security of the power system as secure or not secure. Performance of the algorithm is compared with other neural network based classification algorithms to show its superiority for transient security classification. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Classification algorithm; Gene expression programming; Global search; IEEE standards; Power system transients; Security assessment; Security classification; Static security; Three-phase short circuits; Artificial intelligence; Evolutionary algorithms","Abdelaziz, A.Y.; Department of Electrical Power and Machines, , Cairo, Egypt",,,03029743,9783642353796,,,"English","Lect.

Face recognition has evolved as an important application of biometrics and has been a topic of interest for several machine learning and computer vision communities. However, most of the attempts on face based personal authentication rely on decision threshold for accept or reject of the claimed identity. This paper investigates supervised learning techniques for face verification. The presented approach deals with computation of 5th level Haar wavelet coefficients of image used as feature for training of the classifiers like SVM, fuzzy SVM and KNN. The extracted biometric features are matched to compute genuine and impostor matching scores. The error rates FAR and FRR are then calculated using cross validation of the test set.

Therefore, detection and classification of single-turn fault (TF) are becoming important in the presence of voltage imbalances, under various loading conditions. Substantial studies are conducted on the interturn fault detection, but a comprehensive method for classifying the faults at different operating points of the machine, under varying supply conditions, is still a challenge. This is a critical problem in industries since the induction motors form the major workhorses. The artificial-intelligence-based techniques are advanced methods in fault monitoring. This, when combined with optimization techniques, is expected to give improved and accurate results with minimum false alarms. In this paper, a technique is developed, based on recent developments in the wavelet-based analysis, particularly in the complex wavelet domain. The support vector machines are adopted for comparing the classification accuracy obtained using complex-wavelet-and standard discrete-wavelet-based methods. The receiver operating characteristic curves indicate that the fault detection, down to single turn, is feasible using a single current sensor. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Complex wavelets; fault detection; feature extraction; induction machines; supply imbalance; support vector machine (SVM)","Classification accuracy; Complex wavelet domain; Complex wavelets; Comprehensive method; Critical problems; Current sensors; False alarms; Fault monitoring; Induction machines; Inter-turn fault; Inter-turn short circuit; Loading condition; Operating points; Optimization techniques; Receiver operating characteristic curves; supply imbalance; Voltage imbalance; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Induction motors; Wavelet analysis; Support vector machines","Seshadrinath, J.; Department of Electrical Engineering, , New Delhi 110016, India; email: eez088324@ee.iitd.ac.in",,,00939994,,ITIAC,,"English","IEEE Trans Ind Appl",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872099204

Incipient fault detection has received a lot of attention in recent years. In this paper, a method based on complex wavelets is proposed for incipient fault detection and condition monitoring. A Complex wavelet-Support vector machine (SVM) classifier is developed which takes into account four conditions i.e.: healthy, turn fault (TF) under balanced supply conditions, voltage imbalance and interturn fault with voltage imbalance, both occurring at same time. The performance metrics show the ability of the technique to identify the fault at an early stage and it also provides additional information regarding which of the four conditions is prevailing at a given time. Voltage imbalance and turn fault are often confused. Both affect the performance of the machine and the unbalanced voltage condition considerably reduces the winding insulation life due to overheating. A comparison with standard Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) shows the effectiveness of the method in providing reliable information under variable supply-frequency conditions. © 2012 IEEE.","Condition monitoring; Discrete wavelet transforms; Fault diagnosis; Support vector machines","Analytical wavelets; Complex wavelets; Incipient fault detection; Induction machines; Inter-turn fault; Performance metrics; Turn fault; Unbalanced voltage condition; Vector machines; Voltage imbalance; Winding insulation; Condition monitoring; Discrete wavelet transforms; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Industrial applications; Support vector machines","Seshadrinath, J.; Department of Electrical Engineering, , Delhi, 110016, India; email: jeeva.cts@gmail.com",,,01972618,9781467303309,CIASD,,"English","Conf Rec IAS Annu Meet",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871645365

However, the tendency of electric load sometimes reveals cyclic changes due to seasonal economic activities or climate seasonal nature. The applications of SVR model to deal with cyclic electric load forecasting have not been widely explored. This investigation presents a SVR-based electric load forecasting model which applied a novel hybrid algorithm, namely chaotic genetic algorithm-simulated annealing algorithm (CGASA), to improve the forecasting performance. In addition, seasonal adjustment mechanism is also employed to deal with cyclic electric loading tendency. A numerical example from an existed reference is used to elucidate the forecasting performance of the proposed seasonal support vector regression with chaotic genetic algorithm, namely SSVRCGASA model. The forecasting results indicate that the proposed model yields more accurate forecasting results than ARIMA and TF-ε-SVR-SA models in existed papers.

To address this limitation, this paper presents a memetic algorithm (MA), namely, aBBOmDE, which is a new version of BBO to solve both complex and noncomplex economic load dispatch (ELD) problems of thermal plant. In aBBOmDE, the performance of BBO is accelerated by using a modified mutation and clear duplicate operators. Then, modified DE (mDE) is embedded as a neighborhood search operator to improve their fitness after a predefined threshold. mDE is used with mutation operator DE/best/1/bin to explore the search near the best solution. The length of local search is set to achieve a balance between the search capability and the excess computational cost. In aBBOmDE, migration mechanism is kept same as that of BBO to maintain its exploitation ability. Modified operators are utilized to enhance the exploration ability while a neighborhood search operator, further, enhances the search capability of the algorithm. This combination significantly improves the convergence characteristics of the original algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been verified on five different test systems with varying degree of complexity. The results have been compared with other existing techniques.

In the present study, a novel scheme was presented to detect epileptic seizure activity with very fast and highest accuracy from background electro encephalogram (EEG) data recorded from epileptic and normal subjects. The proposed scheme is based on discrete wavelet packet transform (DWT) with energy, entropy, standard deviation, mean, kurtosis, skewness and entropy estimation at each node of the decomposition tree followed by application of probabilistic neural network (PNN). Normal as well as epileptic EEG epochs were decomposed into approximation and details coefficients till sixth-level using DWT packet. Discrete harmony search with modified differential operator was used to select the optimal features out of all above mentioned statistical and non-statistical parameters. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm for classification purpose using PNN, we have implemented 10-fold cross validation. Clinical EEG data recorded from normal as well as epileptic subjects are used to test the performance of this new scheme.

The results indicate that effect of face recognition is better compared to objects in right occipito and occipito-temporal region than left hemisphere and the time of differentiation is more in case of inanimate objects compared to faces (animate). Secondly, N170 ERP waveform, known as the face-marker is composed of contribution from various brain waves in unique pattern. ERO measures which underlie and compose N170 wave provide additional information to that offered by conventional ERP amplitude measures and serve as a useful genetic markers in the study of prosopagnosia. Studies on object and face processing using ERP integrating with time-frequency analysis opens a new avenue of research in neuroelectrophysiology. This may lead to better understanding of cognitive processing lead to improved clinical diagnosis and provide pathways to understand early visual differences in object recognition in human brain.

In this paper, we improvise the step length determination strategy in the classical seeker optimisation method by considering an optimistically contracting step length calculation. The proposed methodology easily takes care of solving non-linear hydrothermal generation problem along with different constraints like power balance, capacity limits, valve-point loading and prohibited operating zones.

Estimation of accurate fault location will lead to quicker restoration of the supply. Instantaneous values of faulty current, voltage and power signals are available at the relay location. Using 10-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), the available signals are decomposed and thereafter the statistical features are obtained from the decomposed signals. Forward feature selection algorithm is used to select the best feature set. Selected features are then applied to the support vector machine (SVM) for estimating the fault distance. PSO algorithm is used to select the best SVM parameter by global searching technique.

Even in the absence of discrete control variables, the OPF problem [2] is non convex due to the existence of the nonlinear (AC) power flow equality constraints.

However the question as to which wavelet family is the most suitable for analysis of non-stationary bio-signals is still prevalent among researchers. This paper attempts to find the most useful wavelet function among the existing members of the wavelet families for electroencephalogram signal (EEG) analysis. The EEGs considered for this study belong to both normal as well as abnormal signals like epileptic EEG. Important features such as energy, entropy and standard deviation at different sub-bands were computed using the wavelet functions-Haar, Daubechies (orders 2-10), Coiflets (orders 1-10), and Biorthogonal (orders 1.1, 2.4, 3.5, and 4.4). Feature vectors were used to model and train the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and the classification accuracies were evaluated for each case. The results obtained from PNN classifier were compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

Different methods were suggested in the literature to select the largest eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors for linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Some researchers have suggested eliminating the three largest eigenvalues to avoid the effect under varying illumination conditions. But, there is no unified approach for selecting optimal eigenvalues to enhance the performance of an algorithm. In this context, a GAPCA algorithm has been proposed to select optimal eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors in LDA. They proposed a fitness function to find the optimal eigenvectors using the Genetic Algorithm (GA). However, the crossover method used results in differences in offspring, and mutation never allowed them for a physical dispersal of the child in a chosen area. This prevents us in selecting optimal eigenvectors for improvising accuracy of the face recognition algorithm. This has motivated the authors to develop a new algorithm called BFO-Fisher which uses a nutrient concentration function (cost function) for optimization. In this work, the cost function is maximized through hill climbing via a type of biased random walk which is not possible in GA. Here the proposed BFO-Fisher algorithm offers us two distinct additional advantages(i) the proposed algorithm can supplement the features of GA, and (ii) the random bias incorporated into the BFO algorithm guides us to move in the direction of increasingly favorable environment, which is desirable. In this experiment, both Yale and UMIST Databases are used for the performance evaluation. Experimental results presented in this article reveal the fact that about 3% (Rank 1) improvement can be achieved as compared to the GA-Fisher algorithm. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Generally, this is done for a fixed time horizon window (3/5 years) at a time. DTNEP has been proved to be better than the incremental approach in which optimal investment plans are found out for each year separately. In DTNEP, 1st year and last/terminal years are given different treatment, and there is a complete disconnect between two DTNEP windows. Also DTNEP assumes that the conditions during optimization like the earlier year generation, transmission expansion plans get\ executed exactly as per plan &/or the load forecast for the entire period remains unchanged. However, it is well known that this is generally not true. In view of above, this paper presents a rolling window based approach which treats every year of investment in exactly the same fashion. It also has an inherent capability to take care of such changes. It involves successive, overlapping DTNEP for 3/5 years planning horizon. A harmony search algorithm is used for the solution of the problem. Results for two test systems have been obtained to demonstrate the potential of the algorithm. © 2011 Berkeley Electronic Press.

This paper presents a technique to detect and classify the different shunt faults on a transmission lines for quick and reliable operation of protection schemes. Discrimination among different types of faults on the transmission lines is achieved by application of evolutionary programming tools. PSCAD/EMTDC software is used to simulate different operating and fault conditions on high voltage transmission line, namely single phase to ground fault, line to line fault, double line to ground and three phase short circuit. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied for decomposition of fault transients, because of its ability to extract information from the transient signal, simultaneously both in time and frequency domain. The data sets which are obtained from the DWT are used for training and testing the SVM architecture. After extracting useful features from the measured signals, a decision of fault or no fault on any phase or multiple phases of a transmission line is carried out using three SVM classifiers. The ground detection task is carried out by a proposed ground index. Gaussian radial basis kernel function (RBF) has been used, and performances of classifiers have been evaluated based on fault classification accuracy. In order to determine the optimal parametric settings of an SVM classifier (such as the type of kernel function, its associated parameter, and the regularization parameter c), fivefold cross-validation has been applied to the training set. It is observed that an SVM with an RBF kernel provides better fault classification accuracy than that of an SVM with polynomial kernel. It has been found that the proposed scheme is very fast and accurate and it proved to be a robust classifier for digital distance protection. © 2011 IEEE.","Discrete wavelet transforms; Fault classification accuracy and Ground index; Feature extraction; Support vector machine (SVMs)","Cross validation; Data sets; Detection tasks; Distance protection; Double line; Evolutionary programming; Fault classification accuracy; Fault conditions; Fault transients; Gaussians; Ground index; High voltage transmission lines; Kernel function; Line to line fault; Measured signals; Polynomial kernels; Power system engineerings; Power system fault; Protection schemes; PSCAD/EMTDC; Radial basis; RBF kernels; Regularization parameters; Reliable operation; Single phase to ground faults; SVM classifiers; Three-phase short circuits; Time and frequency domains; Training and testing; Training sets; Transient signal; Transmission line; Transmission line faults; Transmission line protection; Bandpass filters; Classification (of information); Computer programming; Discrete wavelet transforms; Electric fault currents; Electric lines; Electric power transmission; Feature extraction; Power transmission; Radial basis function networks; Signal detection; Support vector machines; Transmission line theory; Wavelet decomposition; Fault detection","Singh, M.; Department of Electrical Engineering, , Delhi, 110016, India; email: manoharsingh33@gmail.com",,,,9781424479238,,,"English","Int.

In this multiobjective bacteria foraging (MOBF) optimization technique, during chemotaxis a set of intermediate bacteria positions are generated. Next, we use pareto non-dominance criterion to determine final set of bacteria positions, which constitute the superior solutions among current and intermediate solutions. To test the efficacy of our proposed algorithm we have chosen a highly constrained optimization problem namely economic/emission dispatch. Economic dispatch is a constrained optimization problem in power system to distribute the load demand among the committed generators economically. Now-a-days environmental concern that arises due to the operation of fossil fuel fired electric generators and global warming, transforms the classical economic load dispatch problem into multiobjective environmental/economic dispatch (EED). In the proposed work, we have considered the standard IEEE 30-bus six-generator test system on which several other multiobjective evolutionary algorithms are tested.

Biogeography is the study of distribution of species in nature. In this paper, BBO is modified by applying the concept of mutation as extended migration in phenomenon of mutation and prevention of similar habitats. Mutation as concept of extended migration is based on sharing of the information from best solution which controls the diversity among the population limited to the near feasible solution. These make the fine-tuning of the algorithm from one generation to next and converge fast. Fourteen standard benchmark functions are used to demonstrate the performance of MBBO. The results are compared with eight other population-based optimisation algorithms with discrete version of population. The experimental results are analysed using statistical two paired t-test. MBBO performance is also compared with other modified BBO algorithms. To show the capability of MBBO to solve the problems of continuous type, MBBO and other optimization algorithms are applied as soft computing tool to calculate the resonant frequency of rectangular microstrip patch antennas of different dimensions having various substrate thicknesses.

Hence, the statistical features are derived from this information and are used for the classification purpose. The features extracted are given to the Neural Network (NN) for training and subsequently it is tested for an effective classification. Three types of NN classifiers, namely, Multi Layer Feed Forward (MLFF), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) NN are analyzed for effective classification of PQ disturbances. For real-time implementation, one has to see the structural complexity of NN along with its capability of accurate classification.

The design of three-level VSC converter and system parameters such as ac inductor and dc capacitor is presented for the proposed VSC based HVDC system. It consists of two converter stations fed from two different ac systems. The active power is transferred between the stations either way. The reactive power is independently controlled in each converter station. The three-level VSC is operated at optimized dead angle (β). A coordinated control algorithm for both the rectifier and an inverter stations for bidirectional active power flow is developed based on FFS and local reactive power generation. This results in a substantial reduction in switching losses and avoiding the reactive power plant.

However, electricity price is a complex signal due to its non-linear, non-stationary, and time variant behavior. In spite of performed research in this area, more accurate and robust price forecast methods are still required. In this article a novel technique has been proposed to forecast the electricity prices using wavelet transform and a Feed-Forward Neural Network trained by a Meta heuristic algorithm i.e. Invasive Weed Optimization technique (IWO).

At the relay location, the instantaneous values of faulty current, voltage and power signals are available. The available signals are decomposed using 13-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). From the decomposed signals, the statistical features are obtained. Using forward feature selection algorithm, the best feature set is selected. These features are then applied to an artificial feed forward neural network (FNN) for estimating the fault distance. The proposed fault locator has been trained for different fault scenarios (fault resistance and phase difference) and tested with both integer and non-integer distance values.

Recently, the use of metaheuristic techniques to solve TNEP is gaining more importance due to their effectiveness in handling the inequality constraints and discrete values over the conventional gradient based methods. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) generally perform unconstrained search and require some additional mechanism to handle constraints. In EA literature, various constraint handling techniques have been proposed. However, to solve TNEP the penalty function approach is commonly used while the other constraint handling methods are untested. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of different constraint handling methods like Superiority of Feasible Solutions (SF), Self adaptive Penalty (SP), -Constraint (EC), Stochastic Ranking (SR) and the ensemble of constraint handling techniques (ECHT) on TNEP.

Two different induction motor models such as approximate and exact models are considered. The parameter estimation methodology describes a method for estimating the steady-state equivalent circuit parameters from the motor performance characteristics, which is normally available from the manufacturer data or from tests. Differential Evolution is not completely free from the problems of slow or premature convergence, that's why the idea of a much more efficient variant of DE comes. The variant of DE used for solving this problem utilize the concept of the neighborhood of each population member. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated for two different motors and it is compared with the genetic algorithm and the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm.

To circumvent the problem of premature convergence and local minima, a dynamically varying inertia weight based on the variance of the population fitness is used. This results in a better local and global searching ability of the particles, which improves the convergence of the velocity and better accuracy of the unscented Kalman filter parameters.

In the present study, a novel scheme was presented to detect epileptic seizure activity with very fast and high accuracy from background electro encephalogram (EEG) data recorded from epileptic and normal subjects. The proposed scheme is based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and energy estimation at each node of the decomposition tree followed by application of probabilistic neural network (PNN) for classification. Normal as well as epileptic EEG epochs were decomposed into approximation and details coefficients till the sixth-level using DWT. Approximate energy (EDA) values of the wavelet coefficients at all nodes of the down sampled tree were used as a feature vector to characterize the predictability of the epileptic activity within the records of EEG data. In order to demonstrate the classification accuracy of the proposed probabilistic neural network, tenfold cross-validation was implemented in the expert model. Clinical EEG data recorded from normal as well as epileptic subjects were used to test the performance of this new scheme. It was found that with the proposed scheme, the detection is 99.33% accurate with sensitivity and specificity as 99.6% and 99%, respectively. The proposed model can be widely used in developing countries where there is an acute shortage of trained neurologist. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed SBFO is used to optimize multimodal and high dimensional functions. As all the bacteria update their information simultaneously, it has been named synchronous. A mutation operator proposed in this paper performs the global search. In SBFO, all bacteria process information independently in the same generation; hence parallel computers can be used to evaluate fitness values. The performance of SBFO is validated on a set of seven benchmark functions i.e. Sphere, Rosenbrock, Rastrigin, Griewank, Ackley, Schaffer′s, Shekel′s Foxholes. The results are compared with other published methods such as classical BFO, hybrid BFO (BSO), swarm-based algorithms, differential evaluation and Ashaker.

Now-a-days environmental concern that arises due to the operation of fossil fuel fired electric generators and global warming, transforms the classical economic load dispatch problem into multiobjective environmental/economic dispatch (EED) problem.

Two techniques, dual-Tox (DOXCMOS) and dual-Vth (DTCMOS) technology are explored during the high-level synthesis for leakage optimization. The leakage is assumed to be sum of gate-oxide leakage and subthreshold leakage. Register transfer level (RTL) components are characterized for DOXCMOS and DTCMOS technology accounting for process variations, which is an important issue for nanoscale circuits. Experiments were performed on several high-level synthesis benchmark circuits, which show an average reduction of 79% gate leakage and 76% of subthreshold leakage for DOXCMOS and DTCMOS technology, respectively.

In MBBO, the original BBO is modified by applying the concept of Mutation as extended migration in mutation scheme. Due to this concept of sharing of the information from best solution, increase the diversity among the population limited to the near feasible solution. This makes faster convergence of the algorithm. The proposed technique is validated on thirteen benchmark functions. The results of MBBO is compared with BBO and different existiong methods, which includes multimodal and high dimensional functions. MBBO is used as soft computing tool for calculating resonant frequency of circular microstrip antennas. ©2009 IEEE.","Biogeography; Circular microstrip antenna; Global optimization; Modified biogeography-based optimization (MBBO); Resonant frquency","Benchmark functions; Bio-inspired; Biogeography; Circular microstrip antenna; Evolutionary optimizations; Faster convergence; Feasible solution; Floating points; Global search capability; High-dimensional; Multi-modal; Optimum value; Population-based optimization; Resonant frequencies; Soft computing tools; Convergence of numerical methods; Global optimization; Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Natural frequencies; Soft computing; Optimization","Lohokare, M.

These are useful parameters to discriminate lithology and help in detecting hydrocarbons from seismic data. However, estimation of the lithologic parameters is an inverse problem which is highly nonlinear and non-unique and therefore requires use of some sort of global optimization method. The present study focus on GA based optimization method which offers significant advantages over other existing nonlinear optimization algorithms. The effectiveness of GA in estimating lithologic parameters have been illustrated considering synthetic seismic data which is generated using one-dimensional raytracing method. Results of simulation at different levels of noise demonstrate that the proposed GA based method can successfully estimate the seismic parameters under significant levels of noise and adequate convergence can be achieved. ©2009 IEEE.","AVO; Genetic algorithm; Global optimization; Lithologic parameters; Seismic signal processing","Alternate method; AVO; Global optimization method; Highly nonlinear; Non-linear optimization algorithms; Optimization method; P-wave velocity; Ray-tracing method; S-wave velocity; Seismic datas; Seismic parameters; Seismic signal processing; Acoustic wave velocity; Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Hydrocarbons; Inverse problems; Lithology; Optimization; Seismic response; Seismic waves; Signal processing; Parameter estimation","Misra, S.; Reservoir Services, , Calgary, AB, Canada; email: smisra@arcis.com",,,,9781424456123,,,"English","World Congr.

This increases the ability of BBO to escape from getting trapped in local minima and converges to near-global optimum. This makes faster convergence to the optimum value.

This paper presents a first step towards a probabilistic analysis of the lbest PSO with variable random neighborhood topology by addressing issues like inter-particle interaction and probabilities of selection based on particle ranks. © 2009 IEEE.","Global optimization; Neighborhood topologies; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm intelligence","Best position; Fitness landscape; Inter-particle interaction; Multi-modal; Neighborhood topologies; Neighborhood topology; Premature convergence; Probabilistic analysis; Real-parameter optimization; Selection based; Standard PSO; Swarm Intelligence; Theoretical research; Cellular automata; Global optimization; Intelligent systems; Random variables; Structural optimization; Topology; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Ghosh, S.; Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, , Kolkata, India; email: sayan88tito@gmail.com",,,,9780769537450,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

ST is also utilized to extract some useful features of the disturbance signal. The excellent time-frequency resolution characteristic of the ST makes it an attractive candidate for analysis of power system disturbance signals. The number of features required in the proposed approach is less than that of the wavelet transform (WT) for identification of PQ disturbances. The features extracted by using ST are used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for automatic classification of the PQ disturbances. Since the proposed methodology can reduce the features of disturbance signal to a great extent without losing its original property, it efficiently utilizes the memory space and computation time of the processor. Eleven types of PQ disturbances are considered for the classification purpose. The simulation results show that the combination of ST and SVM can effectively detect and classify different PQ disturbances. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The training data samples are generated using parametric models of the PQ disturbances. The features are extracted using some of the statistical measures on the WPT coefficients of the disturbance signal when decomposed upto the fourth level. These features are given to the fuzzy k-NN for effective classification. The genetic algorithm-based feature vector selection is done to ensure good classification accuracy by selecting 16 better features from all 96 features generated from the WPT coefficients. The necessity of selecting the best feature is to remove the redundant or irrelevant features, which may reduce the performance of the classification. It also reduces the computation time since it uses only 16 features instead of 96 features. The experimental analysis for the validation of the proposed algorithm is carried out in two stages. At the first stage, the sample data set is generated by varying the parameters in models in regular intervals and the proposed algorithm is applied to select the best features to obtain high accuracy.

Here, the state space is divided into self and non-self regions, with the self region corresponding to all possible inputs. Initially, a set of non-self detectors is generated to cover the non-self region. Then the data for one class are removed separately, and the existing detectors are allowed to proliferate class-detectors into the uncovered region. This process is repeated until each class has its own set of class-detectors. Finally, every new PQ disturbance datum is tested to compute its class, by matching either the class-detectors or non-self detectors.

Environmental concerns that arise due to the operation of fossil fuel fired electric generators, transforms the classical problem into multiobjective environmental/economic dispatch (EED). In this paper, a fuzzy clustering-based particle swarm (FCPSO) algorithm has been proposed to solve the highly constrained EED problem involving conflicting objectives. FCPSO uses an external repository to preserve nondominated particles found along the search process. The proposed fuzzy clustering technique, manages the size of the repository within limits without destroying the characteristics of the Pareto front. Niching mechanism has been incorporated to direct the particles towards lesser explored regions of the Pareto front. To avoid entrapment into local optima and enhance the exploratory capability of the particles, a self-adaptive mutation operator has been proposed. In addition, the algorithm incorporates a fuzzy-based feedback mechanism and iteratively uses the information to determine the compromise solution. The algorithm's performance has been examined over the standard IEEE 30 bus six-generator test system, whereby it generated a uniformly distributed Pareto front whose optimality has been authenticated by benchmarking against the varepsilon-constraint method. Results also revealed that the proposed approach obtained high-quality solutions and was able to provide a satisfactory compromise solution in almost all the trials, thereby validating the efficacy and applicability of the proposed approach over the real-world multiobjective optimization problems. © 2008 IEEE.","Environmental/economic dispatch (EED); Multiobjective optimization; Pareto front; Particle swarm","Benchmarking; Boolean functions; Clustering algorithms; Constrained optimization; Constraint theory; Electric generators; Electric machinery; Evolutionary algorithms; Explosive actuated devices; Flow of solids; Fossil fuels; Fuzzy sets; Fuzzy systems; Iterative methods; Mechanisms; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Pareto principle; Solutions; Constrained optimization problems; Decision variables; Economic dispatch; Electrical power; Environmental concerns; Environmental/economic dispatch (EED); External-; Feedback mechanisms; Fuzzy clustering technique; High-quality solutions; Local optimum; Multi objectives; Multi-objective optimization problems; Optimality; Pareto front; Pareto fronts; Particle swarm; Particle swarm algorithm; Particle swarms; Problem involving; Real-world; Search processes; Self-adaptive mutation; Test systems; Uniformly distributed; Fuzzy clustering","Agrawal, S.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, , Austin, TX 78705, United States; email: shubham.nifft@gmail.com",,,1089778X,,ITEVF,,"English","IEEE Trans Evol Comput",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53349169258

The S-transform is an extension of the wavelet transform and provides excellent time localisation of voltage and current signals during fault conditions. The change in energy is calculated from the S-matrix of the current signal using signal samples for a period of one cycle. The change in energy in any of the phases of the two lines can be used to identify the faulty phase based on some threshold value. Once the faulty phase is identified the differences in magnitude and phase are utilised to identify the faulty line. For similar types of simultaneous faults on both the lines and external faults beyond the protected zone, where phasor comparison does not work, the impedance to the fault point is calculated from the estimated phasors. The computed phasors are then used to trip the circuit breakers in both lines. The proposed method for transmission-line protection includes all 11 types of shunt faults on one line and also simultaneous faults on both lines. The robustness of the proposed algorithm is tested by adding significant noise to the simulated voltage and current waveforms of a parallel transmission line. A laboratory power network simulator is used for testing the efficacy of the algorithm in a more realistic manner. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2007.",,"Fault conditions; Parallel transmission lines; Phasor comparison; Protected zones; Simultaneous faults; Time-frequency transforms; Transmission-line protections; Voltage and current waveforms; Algorithms; Electric fault currents; Scattering parameters; Transmission line theory; Electric lines","Samantaray, S.R.; National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India; email: sbhsamant@yahoo.co.in",,,17518687,,,,"English","IET Gener.

This transform has some desirable characteristics that are absent in the continuous wavelet transform. The S-transform is unique in that it provides frequency-dependant resolution while maintaining a direct relationship with the Fourier spectrum.

Although wavelet transform is an excellent tool for detecting and localizing power quality disturbance events, it fails to classify them. This paper therefore, presents a newer approach by phase correcting the wavelet transform known as S-Transform. The S-Transform separates the localizing-in-time aspect of the real valued Gaussian window with the modulation (selection of frequency), so that the window translates and not the modulation. By not translating the oscillatory exponential kernel, the S-Transform localizes the real and imaginary components of the spectrum independently, localizing both the phase and amplitude spectrum. This aspect of the S-Transform is an improvement on the wavelet transform in that the average of all the local spectra does indeed give the same result as the Fourier Transform. Further S-Transform is generalized and used to detect, localize and classify the power quality disturbance events using the extracted features and a simple rule base.",,"Fourier transforms; Frequency modulation; Spectrum analysis; Transients; Wavelet transforms; Power quality; Electric power systems","Chilukuri, M.V.; Faculty of Engineering, , Cyberjaya 63100, Selangor D E, Malaysia; email: vmchilukuri@iee.org",,"Institution of Engineering and Technology",05379989,,IECPB,,"English","IEE Conf Publ",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036038024
