Here, eleven construction companies that build low-energy buildings comparable in performance with passive houses have been interviewed. One conclusion is that there is not one specific barrier that keeps energy-efficient housing from taking off. Instead, the barriers include a whole range of issues that have to be considered. Internal pressure has been a strong contributor to the onset of passive house constructions within the companies and the results indicate that personal commitment is central and perhaps the strongest driver. A general reflection from the interviews is that there is a need to show both construction companies and potential customers that it is possible to build passive houses and that they exist. Unlike the national building regulations, which are not considered to be relevant when it comes to energy consumption, the future building regulations from the European Union are identified as a regulatory driver. Moreover, life-cycle thinking is reported to increase among actors, but that it would be beneficial if banks as well as real estate agents could develop a comprehensive view and become better at considering energy and LCC in their capital budgeting templates. Even if the interest for passive houses is considered low among the public, the market is identified as promising among the construction companies - recently actually large enough to become a driver in itself. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Energy-efficiency gap; Low-energy buildings; Passive houses","Budget control; Building codes; Buildings; Construction; Construction industry; Energy utilization; Houses; Housing; Life cycle; Building regulations; Construction companies; Energy-efficiency gaps; Life cycle thinking; Low energy buildings; Passive house; Potential customers; Real estate agents; Energy efficiency","J.

In fact, climate change and resource depletion have been established scientifically and can no more be neglected. Life Cycle Assessment is acknowledged to be an efficient tool to establish a product environmental profile and can be useful to businesses wishing to analyze their environmental record. Decreasing a building environmental footprint implies, among other considerations, a proper choice of building materials, both structural and architectural. A good avenue would be to select low environmental impact materials from cradle-to-grave. Architectural wooden doors are often specified in non-residential buildings in North America. However, only one Life Cycle Assessment has been carried out on wooden doors. This study explores the cradle-to-grave environmental profile of an interior wood door in a North American context. According to the results, the main contributor to the product impacts is the production of raw materials, especially the particleboard component, and their transportation to the manufacturing plant. The urea formaldehyde production is the main reason for particleboard impacts among the three damage categories, human health, climate change and resources, of IMPACT 2002+. The other life cycle stages that have a noticeable influence on the door environmental impacts are shipping and end-of-life. Transportation as a whole affected the system total environmental score. The current results could serve as a basis for ecodesign implementation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To have sustainable operations, they have begun to incorporate environmental and social concerns into conventional economic objectives. A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is a good instance of an open system with multistage processes and interconnected activities. Efficiency evaluation of CCPPs is a complex task since there exist a variety of inputs (outputs) which enter into any stages of network. Additionally, there might be intermediate products which are consumed by the same power plants. We call such factors “loop” intermediate measures. To measure efficiency of CCPPs, network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) is used. This paper proposes new NDEA models to evaluate efficiency of CCPPs. The proposed models calculate the efficiency of power plants and their sub-sectors under both CRS (constant returns to scale) and VRS (variable returns to scale) assumptions. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis for returns to scale. We apply the new NDEA models to measure relative efficiency of CCPPs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Combined cycle power plants; Multiple objective linear programming; Network data envelopment analysis; Returns to scale; Sustainability","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Linear programming; Sustainable development; Comprehensive analysis; Efficiency evaluation; Intermediate measure; Intermediate product; Multiple objective linear programming; Network data; Returns to scale; Sustainable operations; Combined cycle power plants","R.

Various tools, such as questionnaire surveys, analytic hierarchy process, and fuzzy set theory, have been developed to measure the sustainability of urban regeneration and ensure that it follows the principles of sustainable development. However, these studies, which rely on the indicator system, assume that urban regeneration is a static and isolated state during the assessment process. Hence, this study aims to provide an alternative model for measuring sustainability of urban regeneration. Fuzzy set theory and Monte Carlo simulation were introduced to solicit critical measurement indicators that would lay a unified basis for comparison. Entropy method was also used to determine the weights of relevant critical measurement indicators to avoid subjective judgment. A general decision-making framework for dynamic monitoring of urban regeneration was developed based on the dynamic change of sustainability of urban regeneration (Vk) and urgency of urban regeneration (Uk). Four scenarios were discussed based on the four quadrants generated by Vk and Uk. Therefore, sustainable urban regeneration can be identified and compared through the Vk-Uk coordinate system, and the best practices of urban regeneration can be determined for global promotion. This model has the advantages to process the fuzzy and subjective nature in indicator assessment of sustainability of urban regeneration, which is an improvement compared with existing studies. As well, the decision-making framework could assist policy-makers in determining the sustainability of an ongoing urban regeneration as well in performing a dynamic and long-term monitoring of the process. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Many and diverse actors with contrasting interests interact in urban sustainability transitions. Their perceptions and values impact the potential uptake of transition strategies in urban systems. It is thus important to understand how actors view themselves involved in such processes. A case study on low carbon transitions for the city of Bilbao (Basque Country) is presented to explore the barriers and opportunities for an energy transition using Q methodology. Results suggest that stakeholders' motivation and perceived capacity for change are mainly related to four main discourses: follower, visionary, pragmatist and sceptic. Results also indicate that information exchange, communication and participation in decision-making processes, bridging visionaries and pragmatists with decision-makers, are key for bringing about effective transition processes. This study contributes to identifying attitudes of actors who can negotiate urban low-carbon transitions and stresses the need to build a common shared cognitive vision of whether and how sustainable urban transformation can take place. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A first step in reaching this goal is to conceptualize an inclusive framework for delineating, assessing and guiding the development of these cities towards sustainability. In this study we outline an inclusive, causal framework for Sustainable Development (SD) assessment, entitled ""Trinity of Cities Sustainability from Spatial, Logical and Time Dimensions"" (TCS-SLTD). It has been developed for cities in developing countries, and is illustrated using one such city, Xi'an. After reviewing the history and trends of urbanization of cities in Western China, some principles for assessing sustainability of cities in developing countries are suggested, after which the Xi'an case is presented. The urban area of Xi'an has expanded by more than 10 fold during the last quarter century, while arable land has decreased by 39%. In addition to these dramatic changes in land-use, the main axis of urban expansion has shifted from a north-south axial to radial expansion towards all areas around the core city. Over time, urban expansion has followed a ""concentrated-deconcentrated- concentrated"" trend. Xi'an overall sustainability, as measured by the index we present, has followed an upward - but not monotonic - trend between 1990 and 2010, during which its urbanization rate increased by 30%. On the basis of our multi-dimensional analysis, suggestions are made on how to direct Xi'an toward a more regenerative development path. These include revitalization of the urban system, control of urban form through planning, consulting and informing local communities about sustainable development issues, and achieving efficient functioning and harmonious coordination among different departments and municipal authorities in Xi'an. The TCS-SLTD model, outlined in this study, is a useful tool for guiding the process of Sustainable Development Indicator (SDI) selection, and provides a conceptual framework for holistically assessing the sustainability of city growth and expansion in developing countries. The model can assist urban planners and policy makers in developing countries in the performance of integrated assessments city sustainability, and in the formulation of pragmatic and focused policies to shift cities towards more regenerative and sustainable development trajectories. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper highlights the experience of one of the companies, emphasising how one can leverage enablers and also overcome barriers to implementing MFCA in a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) in Malaysia. Driven by the diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory, the case company found most of its enablers within MFCA's own attributes. Additionally other factors such as the team composition, interpersonal communication, and efforts of the change agents were instrumental in the success of the MFCA implementation. However, the company was also constrained by its suppliers. More importantly, it is envisaged that a potential hurdle for MFCA advancement is when performance management issues are not addressed by higher management. Drawing upon the company's experience and the theoretical literature, other barriers that may also be encountered by SMEs in Malaysia are also discussed. These include for example, overcoming the traditionalist view held by most SMEs, persevering the implementation processes on their own without the direct assistance from MPC and several others. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","ISO 14051; Malaysia; Material Flow Cost Accounting (MFCA); Qualitative research; SME","Costs; Sustainable development; ISO 14051; Malaysia; Material Flow; Qualitative research; SME; Cost accounting","F.

The finite supply of the nutrient, geographical concentration of the remaining supply, and continuing occurrences of eutrophication and harmful algal blooms (caused, in part, by excessive phosphorus outflows into the environment) are causes for immediate concern. As a response, there is increasing recognition that phosphorus entering waste streams should be recovered as a resource rather than disposed of as a pollutant. While phosphorus recovery technology and strategies have been outlined in some detail in the existing literature, none have explicitly addressed the reasons for why these processes have not been implemented at scale. In addition, the potential for urban systems to play a role in creating a holistic management system for phosphorus has received little recognition. This paper addresses these knowledge gaps by offering a tool for analyzing the context, drivers, barriers, and implementation of phosphorus recovery technologies in urban areas. The framework tool consists of five guiding questions. The process of answering the questions presents an opportunity for researchers, decision makers, and community stakeholders to explicitly identify what and how changes to the current system can be made. This paper provides an approach for producing the knowledge necessary for facilitating the transition to an urban phosphorus recovery regime that is relevant for both practitioners and academics. The approach may also be adapted to understanding other resource cycles in the future, such as nitrogen, water, and energy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The technologies have been further developed and improved for the past thirty years. The successful implementation of quality control and construction efficiency has been addressed with support from the public sector. The technologies however did not receive attention from the private sector since prefabrication requires dimensional coordination and standardization in the designs. This situation has changed from 2002 as the Hong Kong government promotes incentives schemes, i.e. gross floor area concessions for private developers to encourage them to adopt prefabrication techniques. This paper discusses and evaluates the best practice of prefabrication implementation in the Hong Kong public and private sectors using two leading case studies. Their adoption of prefabrication, construction methods and cost effectiveness are investigated. Discussions on effective implementation for the sectors have also been explored. The findings provide ameliorated understanding on the best practice of the implementation of prefabrication and provide courage for further improvement and implementation for the industry. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Individual stakeholders steadfastly guard their own interests in any investment decision, which seldom considers any positive gains to society. Green buildings, branded as partial public goods, involve rational and irrational factors, incurring extra transaction costs (TCs) and affecting the willingness of the stakeholders to take part. This paper examines how to reduce the TCs incurred during the game played in the decision-making process with the ultimate aim of promoting GB. In the game model, the developers and end-users negotiate and bargain over the TCs caused by GB in comparison with its conventional counterpart. The findings are that 1) TCs are the overriding barriers impeding the development of the GB market. Reducing TCs will facilitate supply and demand in the GB market; 2) the equilibrium payoffs for the developer and the end-user are proportional to their bargaining powers (the higher the bargaining power is, the more benefit it will gain from the GB transaction); 3) strengthening the bargaining power of the developer can increase the expected utility of developing GB; and 4) more fake GB products or less credible developers will result in higher TCs for the end-users and therefore lower payoffs will be expected. The findings stress that the choice between developers & end-users over investing in GB is a complex game problem, where TCs could be conceptualized and showed their important role. By minimizing the TCs incurred in the complex decision of GB, it will not only benefit themselves but also bring net regenerative outcomes to society. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of anti-corrosion material depositing and covering on the steam seal and then machining to the required thickness and surface quality can be an effective and economical way to prevent rotor supporting plane from corrosion and erosion. Inconel 182 can be this anti-corrosion material, however, it is also difficult-to-cut material. Due to its strong adhesive property, the environmentally friendly lubrication technology Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL) is required when machining Inconel 182 overlays. This study investigates the machinability of Inconel 182 overlays under dry cutting condition and MQL cutting condition during up milling or down milling orthogonal tests. The lubrication/cooling effects of MQL are also evaluated by real-time monitoring and analyzing cutting force signals in time-domain and in frequency-domain. Results indicate that cutting force signals, especially in transverse direction, can be used accurately to estimate the lubrication/cooling effects of MQL. MQL works effectively in up milling because, in this case, tool wear is dominant. However, in down milling, the self-excited vibration due to large impact when tool cut into the workpiece is easily intensified by the high speed MQL droplets, in this case, MQL works ineffectively. Considering the resource efficiency and economics, machining Inconel 182 overlays using up milling with MQL can effectively reduce tool waste and manufacture costs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Cutting force; Down milling; Inconel 182 overlays; Lubrication/cooling effects of MQL; Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL); Up milling","Adhesives; Corrosion prevention; Cutting; Erosion; Frequency domain analysis; Lubrication; Milling (machining); Steam turbines; Cutting forces; Down millings; Inconel 182; Minimum quantity lubrication; Up millings; Cutting tools","M.

The current construction procurement practices have been widely criticized for disregarding sustainability in the project life cycle. At present, there is a gap of knowledge on status-quo of sustainable procurement in Canada. Therefore, the objective of this study is to review sustainable procurement practices in the Canadian construction industry. A multi method research design was used in this study by combining both qualitative and quantitative research methods. Three research tools were used in the study; namely questionnaire surveys, review of documents, and semi-structured interviews. Data triangulation was used to combine the results of all three research tools. The study showed that sustainable procurement initiatives have rarely been used in the Canadian construction industry. Limited sustainability initiatives are used in the project procurement, while environmental sustainability criteria are given the prominence. Furthermore a significant deficiency is observed in bid evaluation involving triple bottom line of sustainability. A majority of construction industry respondents agreed that sustainable procurement is a long due necessity and highlighted government regulations as the main driver for sustainable procurement.

Our empirical analysis focuses on solar building demonstrations in Finland, an unfavorable context for the technology. Our findings show that the demonstrations leveraged sporadic windows of opportunity for the technology resulting from international developments. The projects supported three niche development processes: the building of networks, different types of learning and the creation of visions and expectations, thereby softening the ground for solar technology uptake in new buildings. However, they have also struggled to make an immediate impact on mainstream practices due to weak continuity and the challenging socio-technical environment.

Most 'green' policy instruments that have emerged in recent decades have targeted facilitation of the development and adoption of greener processes, goods and services. Concurrent business models have sought to create and capture value arising from this policy-induced transition to more environmentally sustainable practices. Both such policy instruments and the business models are, however, often evaluated more in terms of their impact on the development and adoption of innovations and less in terms of their impact on behavioural change. This paper provides a critical review of the interplay between green policy instruments and green business models from a behavioural perspective. Instead of looking at policy instruments from a technology-push and demand-pull perspective, this paper samples them in terms of 'sticks', 'carrots' and 'sermons' and then provides a critical review of business models that have emerged in response to these types of policy regimes. The paper finds that most green business models that have emerged in the built environment - in response to sticks - may be characterised as buck-passing, i.e. passing costs to others and skirting around the stick of regulation. Those that emerge in response to carrots as opportunistic carpet-bagging aimed at capturing a temporary gain. Finally, those that emerged in response to sermon-orientated awareness campaigns, show a tendency to diffuse even in the absence of supportive fiscal conditions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This view helps us to re-conceptualize relationships among humans' technological, ecological, economic, social and political systems. Through exploration of 'net positive' or 'regenerative' development lenses and the traditional sustainability literature, the conceptualization and approaches to achieve sustainable development and ecological modernization are expanded to articulate and to explore the evolving sustainability discourse, 'regenerative sustainability'. This Special Volume of Journal of Cleaner Production (SV) is focused upon various dimensions of regenerative sustainability (e.g. regenerative design, regenerative development, and positive development) applied to the urban built environment at scales, which range from individual buildings, neighbourhoods, and urban developments to integrated regional sustainable development. The main focus is on how these approaches and developments are evolving, how they can help us to prevent or adapt to climate change and how these approaches are likely to evolve in the next two to three decades. These approaches are addressed in four themes: (1) reviewing the theoretical development of the discourse of regenerative sustainability, its emerging principles and practices, (2) explaining how it can be measured and monitored, (3) providing encouraging practical pathways and examples of its implementation in multiple cultural and climatic contexts, and (4) mapping obstacles and enablers that must be addressed to help to ensure that more rapid progress is made in implementing the transitions towards an urban built environment that supports genuinely sustainable societies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been widely discussed as to whether or how they have helped transitioning of towns and cities into more sustainable systems in the larger urban context through educational, experiential, societal diffusion and changes in governance processes. The countries in different cultural and geographical contexts with rapid urbanization rates, seek to establish similar developments with relatively less knowledge of the contextual and procedural differences in the eco-towns' processes or the reasons for their varying levels of impact. This article was prepared to summarize and systematize the insights that have been obtained from 'eco-town' based urban developments implemented in the Northwestern Europe with particular emphasis given into the examples from The Netherlands, Sweden and Germany. The review of the relevant literature was conducted with the focus on: a. the context in which the demonstration eco-towns were developed since the emergence of planned communities in the early 20th century, b. the typologies, processes and frameworks through which the eco-towns were initiated, built, governed and evolved. The authors analyzed the wide diversity of frameworks and processes that have played roles in the relative successes and/or failures. The review provided insights into their procedures and the aspects associated with the diffusion of the lessons into the broader urban planning and development methods. The findings suggested that the political commitment, timing, financial aspects, physical qualities, stakeholder involvement and environmental planning were key elements in achieving the eco-towns' goals. Future research is recommended to critically analyze the impacts of these historically new urban development models and frameworks in order to create more effective approaches for achieving positive outcomes for all societies within ecological boundaries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Reflecting these developments, many new categories of 'cities' have entered the policy discourse: 'sustainable cities'; 'green cities'; 'digital cities'; 'smart cities'; intelligent cities'; 'information cities'; 'knowledge cities'; 'resilient cities'; 'eco cities'; 'low carbon cities'; 'liveable cities'; and even combinations, such as 'low carbon eco cities' and 'ubiquitous eco cities'. In practice, these terms often appear to be used interchangeably by policy makers, planners and developers. However, the question arises whether these categories nevertheless each embody distinct conceptual perspectives, which would have implications for how they are understood theoretically and applied in policy. In response, this article investigates, through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, how the twelve most frequent city categories are conceptualised individually and in relation to one another in the academic literature. We hypothesize that, notwithstanding some degree of overlap and cross-fertilization, in their essence the observed categories each harbor particular conceptual perspectives that render them distinctive. This is borne out by the findings, which demonstrate robustly for the first time the conceptual differences and interrelationships among twelve dominant city categories. The 'sustainable city' is the most frequently occurring category and, in a map of keyword co-occurrences, by far the largest and most interconnected node, linked closely to the 'eco city' and 'green city' concepts. Recently, the more narrow concepts of 'low carbon city' and 'smart city' have been on the rise, judging by their frequency of occurrence in academic journals; the latter in particular appears to have become an increasingly dominant category of urban modernization policy. On their part, 'resilient city' and 'knowledge city' represent distinct concepts, albeit with comparatively low frequency. Overall, the findings point to the need for rigor and nuance in the use of these terms, not least if one wishes to comprehend their implications for urban development and regeneration policy and practice. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is suggested that the purpose of the sustainability paradigm flowing from this worldview is not to conserve the status quo or meet ill-defined human needs, but to strengthen the health, adaptive capacity, and evolutionary potential of the fully integrated global social-ecological system so that it can continue regenerating itself, thereby creating the conditions for a thriving and abundant future - not only for the human species, but for all life. In this paper we explore the ecological worldview and the guidelines it provides for how we interpret sustainability; as well as the strategies for the production of the built environment we need to follow if we are to adapt to coming changes in the planetary system and regenerate the world. The question this paper asks is: how does this sustainability paradigm, with its focus on regenerating the whole of the social-ecological system within which we are working, change the way the built environment is produced? To achieve this objective, the paper synthesizes the findings of two separate studies: an extensive literature review to define the meta-narratives of the ecological worldview; and an analysis of in depth interviews with academics and built environment practitioners that aimed to find correlations between the practice and theoretical positions of the participants and the values and praxiology of the ecological worldview as described in the first study. Three main themes of the ecological worldview - wholeness, relationship, and change - provide a framework for discussing the implications of this regenerative sustainability paradigm for the production of the built environment - for how it is created, the technologies used, and how it is evaluated. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, implementing green technologies usually requires more investment than using traditional technologies and the payback period tends to be very long. In China, most developers sell their properties and subsequently transfer the ownership to customers. Hence, a crucial problem for promoting green construction is that developers cannot obtain economic profits (""gold"") from implementing ""green"" technologies. Meanwhile, other stakeholders, such as property management companies, are also hesitant to adopt green technologies because of the large investment involved and their lack of experience. To tackle this problem, an energy performance contracting (EPC) based framework is proposed, to turn ""green"" investment into ""gold"" benefit by careful sharing of the risks existed. The framework was developed by conducting a focus group meeting with three experienced representatives from developer, property management company and energy service company respectively. A real-life case study, which includes both energy efficient system retrofit and new construction, is used to estimate the costs and benefits involved to demonstrate and verify the conceptual framework. The results show that the proposed framework can support the application of green technologies in both types of projects. Economic benefits as well as environmental benefits can be gained for the project stakeholders and the whole society. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To reduce the levels of air pollution will take a strategic realignment of priorities for all of the major players responsible for monitoring and implementing environmental controls to air emissions. Gaining and maintaining compliance of on-the-ground company directors and managers is essential to adequate pollution control, but to date little is known about how managers of heavily polluting companies view pro-environmental measures in their company operation. This paper identifies common characteristics of managers in heavy polluting industries, and measures the impact these characteristics have on corporate environmental behavior based on the survey data that was collected in 2013 from sixty energy companies in China's Shaanxi Province. Personal characteristics of these managers include age, gender, place of birth, level of education, average monthly household income, department, position, environmental awareness, and environmental behavior. Empirical results show that 33.5% of managers that belong to companies with high corporate environmental behavior scores also have the highest level of environmental awareness and environmental behavior. Managers' environmental behavior, awareness and education are significantly positively correlated to corporate environmental behavior. The research also discovered that managers' seniority is positively correlated with corporate environmental behavior, which indicates that senior managers have higher environmental awareness and knowledge. The paper concluded that distinct differences between senior management types related to their core underlying values and these differences matter both for environmental protection and training. Understanding how company directors and managers view their roles in relationship to company environmental protection will require a nuanced approach that rejects a simple uni-dimensional conceptualization of company managers' relationship to environmental implementation. By extension, a ""single-service"" educational approach will also need to be rejected since one message aimed at one set of values will not tap into the range of environmental motivations and values currently held by those in management positions and therefore will be less effective than training approaches that are targeted at specific types of managers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Corporate environmental behavior; Environmental awareness; Heavy-polluting firms; Managers characteristics; Senior managers","Air pollution; Behavioral research; Compliance control; Environmental protection; Health hazards; Managers; Personnel training; Pollution control; Educational approach; Environmental awareness; Environmental behavior; Environmental control; Environmental measures; Heavy-polluting firms; Personal characteristics; Senior managers; Environmental management","","","Elsevier Ltd","09596526","","JCROE","","English","J.

Multiple tools exist to address ecodesign. Life Cycle Assessment, a comprehensive, robust and recognized evaluation tool, enables to identify the product environmental profile. Based on previous LCA results on interior wood doors, this paper aims at proposing an ecodesign strategy based on the generation and evaluation of alternative scenarios. The three selected targets for environmental improvement are particleboard components, transportation and end-of-life. For the particleboard manufacturing, the use of adhesives based on bio-sourced resources was not very conclusive, except for the use of pine tannins in panel manufacture that showed promising results. Concerning transportation issues, switching from road to rail transportation, as well as having a local supplier, decreased the overall environmental impact of the door. The most notable alternative was the end-of-life recycling scenario.

However, most of this literature focuses on cases from North America and Europe. The contribution of this research is to examine how well this literature applies to a different geographical region and policy context by examining the case of Japan's recent policy mix to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds following revisions to Japan's Air Pollution Control Law. The scientific and policy significance of this case includes a high level of private sector voluntary participation and a sizable reduction in volatile organic compound emissions (44.1 percent). Moreover, the case is related to the major global air pollution priorities of particulate matter and ozone, since volatile organic compounds are important precursors of these two secondary pollutants. This was also the first case in Japan's environmental policy to use a combination of regulatory and voluntary approaches. This study draws upon records of official policy discussions, data related to relevant industry associations, and other primary source documents to test hypotheses on participation in voluntary programs for two relatively large emitting industries with high emission capture rates in Japan: the chemical and printing industries. The results indicate that explanations for the participation of Japanese firms are largely consistent with arguments based on North American and European cases regarding regulatory pressure and incentives, market pressure, and self-regulation, but only partially consistent regarding the role of firm size. The analysis shows that there were similarities and differences in the factors influencing the participation of the two industries which were partly related to industrial associations and industrial structure. In addition, the results highlight the importance of two points which are less emphasized by existing literature, the business-government bargaining process, and how to maintain the credibility of regulatory threats and avoid regulatory capture. Several policy implications for the design of voluntary approaches are presented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Air pollution; Business participation; Japanese environmental policy; Policy mix; Volatile organic compounds (VOCs); Voluntary approach","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Commerce; Deregulation; Environmental regulations; Gas chromatography; Organic compounds; Pollution; Pollution control; Public policy; Volatile organic compounds; Environmental policy; Industrial associations; Industrial structures; Industry participations; Volatile organic compound emission; Voluntary approach; Voluntary environmental programs; Voluntary participation; Environmental protection","N.

The challenge for design practitioners educated and now working in a field mainly shaped by a mechanistic worldview is two-fold: first, to develop an understanding of how life and living systems work and, second, to translate that understanding into application. The benefit of taking on this challenge is that understanding natural systems offers powerful insights into how to work across different scales of the built environment. This article looks at key and interrelated living systems' principles and discusses how they translate into design and development practices, using examples of how actual projects worked across multiple scales. Principles considered include the nested or holarchic nature of living systems and the fact that a living system is not separable from its environment. Mapping a design project as a socio-ecological system nested within its immediate and larger contexts shifts designers' attention to the unique and distinctive character of the project environment and the reciprocal influence project and environment exercise on each other. A second principle, that ecosystems' self-organizing and self-regenerating capacity depends on its members carrying out their systemic roles, provides the basis for defining and designing a distinctive and generative role for a project within its place. This role enables the project to be both more valuable and valued as a source of greater viability and vitality and, drawing on the first principle, to have a positive influence across different scales of nested wholes. The third principle relates to the webs of dynamic flows and metabolic exchanges that enable life to continuously produce, repair, and perpetuate itself. Using insights gained from the understanding of the essence of a place, design practitioners are able to identify transformative nodal points within those webs where targeted acupuncture interventions, sometimes small, can influence the health and renewal of the whole system. In conclusion, the article first summarizes how working from an understanding of living systems principles provides insights into working regeneratively across and within different scales. Second, it addresses the need for the role of designers to shift and for new capabilities to be developed in order to incorporate those insights into new development and design practices. Third, it highlights some of the challenges design practitioners might face when implementing a living systems approach within the complexity of multi-disciplinary design projects. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Manufacturers have begun to consider the need for responsible resource use and management during the product life cycle, particularly during the product retirement phase. The determination of appropriate end-of-life (EOL) options for retired product components is a crucial issue relative to most manufactured products. To address it, the product design process must be modified to consider sustainability in a comprehensive manner. At present, only limited existing research integrates social sustainability into EOL option determinations; that gap, in part, stimulates this study. We also recognize that a product designer's background and experience will directly affect the EOL strategy selection. Therefore, incorporating the designer's perception along with sustainability dimensions into an EOL strategy determination is essential and also motivates this investigation. In our proposed approach, quantitative indicators are used to assess sustainability dimensions — economic (residual value), environmental (Eco-indicator) and social impact (job creation, human toxic potential and land use) — for each EOL option. The primary merit of this approach is transferring the essential but not directly relevant design preferences into sustainability analysis through fuzzy logic-based transformation equations. An expected value is derived to represent the sustainability value of each EOL option. An automobile gasoline engine is used as a case study to illustrate the methodology. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Design for end-of-life (EOL); Design for sustainability; Fuzzy analysis; Multi-criteria decision making","Automobile manufacture; Computer circuits; Decision making; Ecodesign; Electroplating shops; Environmental impact; Fuzzy logic; Land use; Life cycle; Product design; Design for end of lives; Fuzzy analysis; Fuzzy logic based approach; Multi criteria decision making; Quantitative indicators; Sustainability analysis; Sustainability dimensions; Transformation equationss; Sustainable development","J.

The aim of this study was to develop a model to predict the cost and schedule performance of green building projects based on the level of definition during the pre-project planning phase. To this end, a three-step process was proposed: pre-processing, variable selection, and prediction model construction. Data from 53 certified green buildings were used to develop the models. After balancing the data set with respect to the proportion of cases in each of the outcome categories by pre-processing, the number of input variables was reduced from 64 to 13 and 7 for cost and schedule performance prediction respectively, using the ReliefF-W variable selection method. Then, cost and schedule performance prediction models were constructed using the selected variables and four different classifiers: a support vector machine (SVM), a back-propagation neural network (BPNN), a C4.5 decision tree algorithm (C4.5), and a logistic regression (LR). The classification performance of the four models was compared to assess their applicability. The SVM models exhibited the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in predicting both the cost and schedule performance of green building projects. The results of this study empirically validated that the cost and schedule performance of green building projects is highly dependent on the quality of definition in the pre-project planning phase. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To achieve this, several tools are available to the organizations such as Quality Function Deployment for Environment (QFDE) which is the integration of voice of customer, voice of environment and quality characteristics. In this paper, an integrated QFDE, fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) is proposed for sustainable product design to help companies identify the best design criteria for a specific product. Therefore, the DEMATEL method is used to assume the interdependence of customer attributes and, in addition, fuzzy Maximum Mean de-Entropy (MMDE) algorithm is utilized to choose the best and practical threshold value in DEMATEL process. Moreover, FANP will be integrated into QFDE as a prioritization technique and also fuzzy Logarithmic Least Squares Method (LLSM) is employed to find weights during the FANP process. An integrated QFDE methodology is appropriate to use in early design, since it does not require detailed information about the product. In order to examine the practicality of the proposed model, a case study is carried out in Iran Transfo Corporation which attracts a significant interest due to its undeniable impacts on the environment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Fuzzy Analytic Network Process; Fuzzy DEMATEL; Fuzzy Logarithmic Least Squares Method; Maximum mean de-entropy algorithm; Quality Function Deployment for Environment; Sustainable product design","Decision making; Decision theory; Design; Ecodesign; Entropy; Least squares approximations; Product design; Quality function deployment; Sustainable development; Entropy algorithms; Fuzzy analytic network process; Fuzzy dematel; Logarithmic least squares; Sustainable product designs; Fuzzy logic","","","Elsevier Ltd","09596526","","JCROE","","English","J.

Among all the traditional pollutants, sulfur dioxide has been monitored by the Chinese government since the 1990s. In this study, China's city-level panel data between 2002 and 2012 are utilized to investigate the existence of convergence in per capita sulfur dioxide emissions across Chinese cities. The conventional estimation methods for β-convergence suffer from an endogeneity problem and therefore produce biased results. To address the endogeneity problem and allow for dynamics, dynamic panel data estimators are utilized, and the static estimation results are conducted as a robustness check. In addition, the influential factors for convergence are examined. The empirical results indicate that, in the chosen sample period, there were absolute and conditional convergences in per capita sulfur dioxide emissions across cities within the whole nation as well as in the eastern, western and central regions of China. Because per capita Gross Domestic Product and the ratio of secondary industry to Gross Domestic Product are both positively related with per capita sulfur dioxide emissions, higher income per capita and greater importance of the secondary industry would cause the convergence speed to be lower. Therefore, the most straightforward policy implication for the empirical results is that the policies for controlling sulfur dioxide emissions should be regionally differentiated: for cities with high sulfur dioxide emissions per capita, the regulation could be tight, as the emissions would decrease faster because convergence exists; however, for cities with low sulfur dioxide emissions per capita, the target for reducing emissions should not be excessively aggressive. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These transformations are referred to as system innovations for sustainability or transitions. Transitions and system innovations cover not only product and process innovations but also changes in user practices, markets, policy, regulations, culture, infrastructure, lifestyle and management of firms and have significant implications for design and innovation activity aiming to contribute to the societal endeavour of achieving sustainability. Even though theory on system innovations and transitions is now extensive, it provided explanations regarding how companies and design and innovation activities fit into the big and long-term picture of system innovations and transitions only to a certain extent. In addition, there have not been many efforts in the design for sustainability field to learn from the theories of transitions and system innovations. In this paper, we make an initial theoretical contribution into the design and innovation for sustainability field by integrating relevant insights from sustainability science and system innovations and transitions theories.

In doing this, this paper examines three sustainable community rating tools in Australia, namely Green Star-Communities PILOT, EnviroDevelopment and VicUrban Sustainability Charter (Master Planned Community Assessment Tool). In order to identify their similarities, differences and advantages these are compared in terms of sustainability coverage, prerequisites, adaptation to locality, scoring and weighting, participation, presentation of results, and application process. These results provide the stakeholders of sustainable community development projects with a better understanding of the available rating tools in Australia and assist with evaluation and decision making. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One central issue in striving towards reduced carbon emissions in the building and construction sector is to develop a practical and meaningful yardstick to assess and communicate GHG results through carbon labelling. The idea of carbon labelling schemes for building materials is to trigger a transition to a low carbon future by switching consumer-purchasing habits to low-carbon alternatives. As such, failing to change purchasing pattern and behaviour can be disastrous to carbon labelling schemes. One useful tool to assist customers to change their purchasing behaviour is benchmarking, which has been very commonly used in ecolabelling schemes. This paper analyses the definition and scope of benchmarking in the carbon labelling schemes for building materials. The benchmarking process has been examined within the context of carbon labelling. Four practical issues for the successful implementation of benchmarking, including the availability of benchmarks and databases, the usefulness of different types of benchmarks and the selection of labelling practices have also been clarified. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As an initiative commissioned by the South Australian State Government in 2009, Lochiel Park is a recent model designed to embrace sustainable planning principles and technologies in a domestic context. An extensive post-occupancy monitoring program of actual residential water and energy usage was conducted. The study aimed at analysing and quantifying the water consumption at 59 houses through real-time monitored data collected over 3 years between 2010 and 2013, incorporating the monitored usage of mains water, collected rainwater and hot water usage. The analysis shows that the annual average total water consumption per household at Lochiel Park is significantly lower than both the Adelaide and national averages by about 24% and 16% respectively, while average mains water consumption is lower by 36% and 29% respectively. Rainwater contributes 6-10% of the total water use in summer and up to 26% in winter, with an average annual contribution of around 14%. A significant part of the saving is attributed to the increased minimum rainwater tank capacity from the 1 kL specified in the Building Code of Australia to 1.5 kL, and feeding rainwater into the hot water supply in a climate where rainfall occurs in winter. Although a reduced hot water demand is also prompted by having efficient fixtures and rainwater supply depends on climate, rainwater fed into hot water supply saves 40% of hot water consumption annually. Greater rainwater utilization in hot water is possible if rainwater tank sizing and a greater roof catchment area can match household winter hot water demand, rather than having a single minimum requirement across all households as in the current regulation. The study provides an understanding of the performance of alternative urban water systems. The outcomes verify the effectiveness of the Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) features implemented and will be useful for future strategic planning and design initiatives for implementation of similar developments on a larger scale. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

According to the CDM rules, energy efficiency improvement projects in the building sector are valid for emissions trading. Although the potential saving of energy is significant, there is only a limited number of building projects being registered as CDM projects. This paper explores the applicability of CDM in the building sector by reviewing the implementation of CDM and its advantages and disadvantages. Hong Kong was selected for an in-depth study due to its eligibility for CDM and yet non-starter status. According to a questionnaire survey supplemented by interviews with the stakeholders in this study, major hindrances such as the lack of financial incentive, inadequate knowledge about emissions trading and insufficient governmental support were found in potential CDM projects in the building sector. It is recommended that an inter-city emissions trading market covering mainland China and Hong Kong, and suitable emission reduction targets should be established and led by the government at the initial stage. By setting up an emission exchange centre, local emissions trading activities could be facilitated and job opportunities could be created. In addition to conducting emissions trading, Hong Kong may also contribute to emissions trading in the region by making use of its highly skilled professional services and efficient business environment. This study paves the way for a densely built city such as Hong Kong to benefit environmentally and economically from a cleaner region in its vicinity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Policies that were based on economic growth along with rapid urban population increases in the 20th century irreversibly and negatively impacted most urban eco-systems globally. Climate changes began to occur mainly due to fossil carbon intensive technologies upon which the urban systems and lifestyles have co-evolved. Concepts such as sustainable development (SD) and ecological modernization (EM) were among the most discussed approaches with regard to ways of responding positively to the emerging environmental concerns induced by the growth policies and development strategies. In spite of some positive contributions to urban policies that resulted in relative successes, most notably in Northwest Europe, questions remained as to whether these concepts have effectively and sufficiently catalyzed the promotion of sustainable urban developments more broadly. By building this literature review, the authors explored the evolutionary aspects and the shortcomings of the EM and SD within the overarching sustainability paradigm. The review addressed the emerging theories developed to improve approaches to urban development policies and procedures, and to contextualize the evolution of regenerative or net positive developments in broader cultural, geographical and temporal contexts. The historically significant antecedents were reviewed and visions for needed transitions were outlined in this two-part series of review articles. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The establishment of measurable environmental performance indicators for the product development process is often cited as a successful factor for effective ecodesign implementation, since it enables setting targets and monitoring achievements towards the accomplishment of environmental ambitions. However, companies still face difficulties in the selection and application of environmental performance indicators – a more structured approach is still lacking. This paper presents the efforts made to identify and systematize existing leading product-related environmental performance indicators, based on a systematic literature review, and to develop a guide to support the selection of these indicators by manufacturing companies. From the review, 261 environmental performance indicators were identified and systematized in a digital database. The database supports the application of the environmental performance indicators guide, which proposes a five-step approach to support the selection of indicators. Based on improvement opportunities identified from a case study for theory-testing in Denmark, an improved version of the guide was developed and subsequently applied in a case study in Brazil. The results from both evaluations indicate that the guide supported the studied companies in the selection of environmental performance indicators in the context of ecodesign implementation. This paper presents the results of the literature review, the systematization of environmental performance indicators and the support guide. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Ecodesign management; Environmental performance indicators (EPIs); Product development","Benchmarking; Database systems; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Product development; Digital database; Environmental performance; Environmental performance indicators; Literature reviews; Manufacturing companies; Product development process; Structured approach; Systematic literature review; Environmental management","","","Elsevier Ltd","09596526","","JCROE","","English","J.

These effects are expected to escalate with climate change. In response, alternative and more sustainable drainage practices with a holistic approach have been developed, although their wide-scale implementation has been limited largely due to socio-institutional barriers. This paper presents an innovative regenerative urban stormwater methodology for transition management at city level, containing two main enablers to overcome the barriers that drag out progress. First, a structured set of activities, the 'wheel', to guide and document the process, which is steered by a group of regional actors. Then, a visual and effective set of indicators that monitors and assesses the progress achieved and identifies the strategies to move forward. Its successful application to Benaguasil, a Mediterranean city, reveals that by integrating the views and strategies from actors at different but interconnected scales and following a structured but flexible methodology, it is possible to make progress in only few years and have a promising future ahead. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The toner is a fine powder mainly composed of a resin and a coloring agent, which has been widely used in digital printing. The optimization strategy has been testified to produce printing toners with appropriate physical (particle size (PS) and PS distribution (PSD)) and color (L∗, a∗, b∗) properties through emulsion aggregation (EA) route. The EA is inherently a unique, environmentally friendly process that gives the provider the benefits of an accurate and efficient printing. The influence of heating rate (R), mixing time (T), and mixing rate (S) on PS, PSD, and (L∗, a∗, b∗) has been studied, where a number of approximation functions including linear, linear with interaction, quadratic and cubic models were served to assess whether or not the response variables are governed by the aforementioned parameters. In addition, toners manufactured based upon RSM were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, colorimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry techniques. The results proved that the models used are hardly adequate for assessing the PS and L∗ responses. Moreover, PSD and a∗ were not governed by the chosen factors, as a whole. On the other hand, R and S variables have meaningful impact on b∗ and a quadratic model is consistent with the experimental data. The cubic model yielded the best coefficient of determination, where the desired toner was suggested to be produced at condition: R = 1200 rpm min, T = 90 min and S = 30 min. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Digital printing; Emulsion aggregation; Environmentally friendly toner; Multiple process optimization; Response surface methodology","Differential scanning calorimetry; Digital printing; Emulsification; Mixing; Optimization; Particle size; Process control; Surface properties; Approximation function; Coefficient of determination; Emulsion aggregations; Engineering characteristics; Environmentally friendly process; Environmentally friendly toner; Optimization strategy; Response surface methodology; Scanning electron microscopy","M.

In our study, we address the question, if and how fast these long-term sustainability targets can be reached and how the underlying transformation path develops. We focus on the long-term design of sustainable industry supply networks. As integral part of a comprehensive linear optimization model “Minimize the Time-to-Sustainability” (TTS) is proposed as a novel optimization strategy for this problem. The TTS strategy is based on the triple bottom line sustainability concept which incorporates multiple and often incompatible objectives for the environmental, economic and social dimension of sustainability, e.g. reducing greenhouse gas emission, maintaining supply network cost competiveness, and creating new job opportunities. In contrast to conventional optimization strategies, TTS minimizes the time until pre-defined target values for all sustainability objectives are achieved and thus the supply chain reaches a sustainable steady state. With this approach, TTS delivers new insights on how supply networks transform towards a sustainability steady state and allows decision makers to validate the feasibility and impact of long-term sustainability targets. Three variants of the TTS approach are presented and evaluated using the transition towards more electrified vehicles in the automotive industry as a specific application. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Automotive industry; Optimization strategy; Supply network design; Sustainable supply chain; Time-to-sustainability","Automotive industry; Climate change; Crashworthiness; Decision making; Greenhouse gases; Linear programming; Optimization; Statistical process control; Supply chains; Conventional optimization; Linear optimization model; Long-term sustainability; Optimization strategy; Supply network designs; Sustainability objectives; Sustainable industries; Sustainable supply chains; Sustainable development","H.-O.

However, there is an urgent need to assess the environmental performance of prefabrication technology to identify whether it is an effective method that is conducive to sustainable development. This study considered two typical residential projects using the two technologies to conduct a fair comparison between prefabrication technology and cast-in-situ technology. Various measuring methods, including content analysis, face-to-face interviews and on-site measurements, were used for data collection. Environmental impact (EI) categories selected for the study included resource depletion, energy consumption and construction waste discharge. Two life cycle assessment (LCA)-based models, the construction environmental performance assessment system (CEPAS) and the building health impact assessment system (BHIAS), were integrated to measure the EI of the two construction technologies based on three damage categories, namely, ecosystem damage, resource depletion and health damage. Finally, social willingness to pay (WTP) was applied to integrate the damage categories for comparisons. The results indicated that the sample prefabricated residential building (PRB) construction was more efficient in energy use, with a 20.49% reduction in total consumption compared to the sample traditional residential building (TRB) construction. The use of prefabrication demonstrated a certain degree of advantages in EI, including a 35.82% reduction in resource depletion, a 6.61% reduction in health damage and a 3.47% reduction in ecosystem damage. Prefabrication technology was more environmentally friendly because of its advantages in reducing damage to the environment compared with traditional cast-in-situ construction technology. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents an analysis of the current situation and existing potentials for future expansion. A specific analysis methodology has been developed and applied by a research consortium in 18 EU countries. This methodology has mostly built upon an extensive review of the existing literature and on interviews of a large number of acknowledged experts. Its application has allowed identifying encouraging development trends in specific market segments where the possibility of aggregating the EES demand or of exploiting good relationships with customers have created interesting investment opportunities. These trends have been observed in particular in Germany, Denmark, France, Flanders (BE), Hungary, Romania and UK. The assessment performed has also allowed discussing a series of strategies and policy measures that can be adopted to overcome existing barriers to market development. The general conclusion drawn in the paper is that energy efficiency policies supporting EES markets in the residential sector are highly needed. Although EU policies have typically a limited direct impact, they can increase trust into EESs and EES providers. At the national level, a stronger collaboration of governments or local administrations with banks to finance EESs is still very necessary in many EU countries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The cause of such imbalance is that environmental protection is not included in the product design and research and design phase by enterprises. Through green quality function deployment, this study integrated life cycle analysis into green design during the product research and design process, and applied the fuzzy theory to reduce customers' subjective judgment in semantics. A research and design model for green design was developed. The fuzzy green quality function deployment showed that customers considerably concern about 'whether toxic materials are used in mobile design and production (15%)', 'whether there is excessive energy consumption in the circuit design (14%)', and 'whether the design of the battery can affect the environment (12%)'. This study developed a product research and design tool that considers the environment, quality, cost, and customer demand. Using fuzzy theory and quality planning, this study determined the importance of product design in technical attributes. It is expected that limited corporate resources can be applied in the key technical factor, thus developing a product research and design model to balance economic development and environmental protection. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Environmental protection; Fuzzy logic; Green design; Life cycle; Quality Function Deployment (QFD)","Climate change; Ecodesign; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Fuzzy logic; Life cycle; Quality function deployment; Sales; Semantics; Toxic materials; Corporate resources; Economic development; Global climate changes; Life cycle analysis; Mobile phone design; Quality function deployments (QFD); Technical attributes; Technical factors; Product design","","","Elsevier Ltd","09596526","","JCROE","","English","J.

Many divisions of construction industry are accustomed to sustainable development concept especially environmental issues but hardly economic and social aspects. Among these divisions, the industrial buildings have gained less attention, while many developing and even developed countries require growth in industrial areas. This may highlight the need for studying sustainability in industrial buildings to accomplish sustainable development goals. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate and identify sustainability indicators (environmental, social, and economic) for three phases of construction, operation and maintenance, and demolition of petrochemical projects. Additionally, the collected data from a questionnaire survey are analyzed by evaluating the mean values and adopting the structure equation modeling approach. Then the importance of individual indicators and their correlation with main aspects of sustainability are examined. Moreover, this study examines the relationship among three dimensions of sustainable development concept and their influence on each other and the related phases. Furthermore, the most important indicators in this study are compared with some previous research. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Nowadays, these residues are disposed, but they could be used as feedstock for a biorefinery. Before implementing a biorefinery system to treat the residues from the tequila industry in Mexico, it is necessary to assess the economic and environmental performance of the entire supply chain for biofuel production. Developing a proper optimization framework for supply chain management in the tequila industry in Mexico that will consider all the activities involved along with the conflicting objectives of its daily operation represents a scientific challenge. Therefore, this paper presents a multi-objective optimization approach for designing such a supply chain that accounts for the simultaneous maximization of the net present value and environmental performance of the network. The environmental objective function accounts for impacts in ecosystem quality, human health and damage to resources. These are quantified through the eco-indicator 99 method. Numerical results show that the implementation of a biorefinery system in Mexico based on the residues from the tequila industry can provide significant economic and environmental benefits. Particularly, results indicate that the best economic solution shows a profit of 7.9 × 108 USD/year. Furthermore, the distributed system involving several central and distributed processing plants allows obtaining significant economic improvements. Finally, the results reported through Pareto curves allow identifying several solutions that are appealing for decision makers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Bioethanol; Biofuels; Biogasoline; Environmental impact; Multi-objective optimization; Supply chain","Alcoholic beverages; Bioconversion; Bioethanol; Biofuels; Decision making; Distributed database systems; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Lignocellulosic biomass; Multiobjective optimization; Refining; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Biogasoline; Conflicting objectives; Distributed processing; Economic and environmental benefits; Economic and environmental performance; Environmental objectives; Environmental performance; Lignocellulosic residues; Industrial economics","J.M.

To date, these cars have not been effectively collected or recycled. Policies must be deliberately devised and reformed to facilitate state-of-the-art vehicle recycling and minimize waste arising from end-of-life cars. In this study, dynamic modeling and cost-benefit analysis have been employed to investigate how polices, including government subsidies, a value added tax and a deposit-refund system, may affect recycling of end-of-life passenger cars. The results indicate that a combination of deposits and subsidies will surpass all of the other independent policies in terms of the recycling rate. This combination is expected to lead to a recycling rate of 80% of end-of-life passenger cars by 2050. However, the government will have to pay an annual 62 billion Chinese Yuan in the middle of the century for old-for-new replacement subsidies, posing a heavy burden on public finance. Comparatively, the deposit-only scenario will cost the government 4.7 billion Chinese Yuan and elevate the recycling rate to 46% in 2050. These policies may help curb the black market and promote the legitimate business of dismantling and recycling in the long run. Moreover, the prospect of vehicle remanufacturing will play another key role in diminishing the black market. The results in China are compared with policies and practices in Europe, Japan and South Korea to help decision-makers develop the most appropriate strategies for end-of-life vehicle management. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Cost-benefit analysis; Dynamic modeling; End-of-life passenger cars; Policies; Recycling rate","Automobiles; Commerce; Decision making; Deposits; Dynamic models; Fleet operations; Public policy; Recycling; Solid wastes; Decision makers; End of lives; End-of-Life Vehicles; Government subsidies; Public finance; Recycling rate; State of the art; Value added tax; Cost benefit analysis","D.
